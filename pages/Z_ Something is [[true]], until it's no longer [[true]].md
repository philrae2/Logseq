title: Z: Something is [[true]], until it's no longer [[true]]
---

- [[Absolute]]s lie in God, [[truth]]s only are true within a certain framework and taken out of that [[context]] or [[environment]] they become [[false]]
	 - Just because something is [[true]] does not mean it is [[absolutely]] true all the [[time]] and [[everywhere]]
