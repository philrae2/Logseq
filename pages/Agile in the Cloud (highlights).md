	- In finding our rhythm, three Agile ideals were especially important:
	  
	  •   Respond to change over following a plan
	  •   Reflection at regular intervals
	  •   Individuals and interactions over processes & tools ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jxvr6v0jqr18r69czv7kbp))
	- Agile is simply a philosophy, intended to empower teams to figure out how to work well together. This means, once you realize something’s not working, change it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jxxt3qx89qjrz2s8k06xy8))
	- Being Agile means trying different approaches and figuring out what interactions work best for your team, at a given time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jye8tg8h33mcfkmfmnz8fv))
	- Over the past six months, we’ve had success with Agile because we continued to try new approaches that we think might foster a more productive, collaborative team. Sometimes our hypothesis is wrong, but we’re happy to try, and fail, quickly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jyfdxstavh98c5k0xrq5ce))
	- Like with any skill you want to improve, for a team to work better together they need to take stock of their current working style to figure out what’s going well and where they’re falling short. Sounds easy enough, but honest self-reflection is not so simple. Agile teams need to be democratic with all team members feeling psychologically safe to speak their mind, otherwise you risk getting biased feedback from only certain individuals or personality types, and you likely miss out on the best ideas!

	- Two easy and powerful ways to get regular feedback from the full team are, in my experience:
	  
	  •   Create open/safe feedback channels. If you have a few dominating personalities, try using non-verbal feedback systems (e.g. write comments on post-its) and strongly encourage feedback from everyone, for instance by allocating speaking time slots.
	  •   Get an outsider’s perspective on how the team interacts. We occasionally invite Agile coaches to join our demos or retros and then get their feedback on the spot at the end of the meeting. They have pointed out things like, *“your retro elicits honest feedback, but what are your one to two tangible action items for your team to improve?”* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jynfy3jaa6am36rdh0sma4))
	- With reflection, our team realized that some team members lacked context of their teammates’ work, and if they didn’t feel comfortable asking questions, the knowledge gap continued to expand even further. We stopped dividing into smaller groups during quarterly planning so team members acquired a baseline understanding of all user stories. And, given we are a large team with broad scope, we focused on sharing the business context and value during demos. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jz02rhz6dhksezse79a7f1))
	- On a macro level, we also have quarterly workshops with key players from all teams — Palantir, product owners, business owners, and developers. These sessions always start with a retrospective to uncover friction, discuss how we’ve progressed since the last meeting, and articulate what is working well and what is not. This sets a workshop tone of openness and transparency, and in part helps us refine the workshop’s agenda. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jz0hfwxfcc8trrz3pqkrzd))
