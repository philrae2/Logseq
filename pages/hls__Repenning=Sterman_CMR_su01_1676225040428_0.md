- A number of careful studies have now demonstrated that companies making a serious commitment to the disciplines and methods associated with TQM outperform their competitors.1 There is now little doubt that when used properly, TQM produces significant value to both organizations and their customers. Yet paradoxically, it remains little used. A recent study found that fewer than 10% of the Fortune 1000 had well-developed TQM programs; and, in another study, TQM fell from the third most commonly used business tool in 1993 to 14th in 1999.2 The situation is similar for a wide range of other administrative and technological innovations.

- Techniques touted as today’s“core competencies” all too often become tomorrow’s failed programs. Once an effort has failed, there is an almost irresistible temptation to label it a fad or“flavor of the month.” However, digging a little deeper shows that many such techniques have useful content. It should come as little surprise then that many currently popular innovations are little more than old ideas with new acronyms. The core disciplines associated with statistical process control and variance reduction become six-sigma; what was once called a quality circle is now a high-performance work team.

- The ability to identify and learn about new improvement methods no longer presents a significant barrier to most managers. Instead, successfully implementing these innovations presents the biggest challenge. Put more simply, you can’t buy a turnkey six-sigma quality program. It must be developed from within.

- Most importantly, our research suggests that the inability of most organizations to reap the full benefit of these innovations has little to do with the specific improvement tool they select. Instead, the problem has its roots in how the introduction of a new improvement program interacts with the physical, economic, social, and psychological structures in which implementation takes place. In other words, it’s not just a tool problem, any more than it’s a human resources problem or a leadership problem. Instead it is a systemic problem, one that is created by the interaction of tools, equipment, workers, and managers.
