	  The three sections of a Cornell Note
	  
	  The three sections consist of:
	  
	  â€¢   **Notes**: This broader right\-hand column is designated for writing down your observations. Typically, primary concepts are clustered, with gaps in between.
	  â€¢   **Cues**: The narrow left\-hand column is designated for cues or prompts linked to the primary concepts on the right in the notes column. These cues aim to stimulate memory, helping you remember and connect the documented ideas.
	  â€¢   **Summary**: Situated at the base of the page, this section features a succinct summary of the key ideas obtained from your notes. In this segment, you are urged to condense your notes into a few terms, simplifying the process of recalling the central points.

	- As you can see, there are three sections: Notes, Cues, and a summary.
	  
	  By grouping thoughts into main ideas and adding spacing between them, helps the ideas stand out clearly as distinct. The cues on the left column help us to quickly understand those ideas and also remember what is in our notes. The summary section is a concise review of the main teaching points.

	- The Benefits of Cornell Notes
	  
	  The Cornell Note-Taking System is a versatile method for organizing and summarizing information that provides numerous advantages for both students and professionals. Key benefits of this system include enhanced organization through its structured layout consisting of main ideas, cues, and summaries, which results in easily readable notes.
	  
	  Employing this system encourages active learning, leading to increased comprehension and retention of information.
	  
	  â€¢   It emphasizes identifying essential concepts and connections between ideas, fostering improved understanding.
	  â€¢   it positively impacts long-term information retention and is adaptable to a variety of subjects, disciplines, and scenarios such as lectures, seminars, meetings, personal study sessions, and taking notes on what we read in books and articles.

	- Cornell Notes in Obsidian
	  
	  The main concepts of Cornell Notes map nicely into Obsidian. Remember our goals are to group thoughts together as main ideas, use cues to give us mental triggers into our notes, and a summary to provide a consolidated review of our notes.
	  
	  These Cornell Note elements can be duplicated with the use of headings and callouts.
	  
	  Here is an example of how the paper note discussed in the previous section can be done in Obsidian as a digital note:

	  Cornell Note using Obsidian headers and callouts
	  
	  Here we **group thoughts** together using [headers, such as H1, H2, and so on](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Headings). These visually grippy clump thoughts together and creates spaces between ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4svwngkkxh80pvygh42btf8))
	- **For cues**, we use the *Info* callout. For example:
	  
	  >[!info] Capture
	  
	  **For the summary**, we use a Summary callout. For example
	  
	  >[!summary] Summary: >- PKM helps us create a personal learning network, and improve their productivity. >- To manage knowledge: we capture, organize, and utilize knowledge.
	  
	  You notice I am using callouts. This is because callouts create a distinctive visual indicator in Obsidian. In effect, they call out, like your notes raising their voice to get your attention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4svwy2fcxnn357j756r1jt0))
