	- [[q: how to present]]
- Format
	- When presenting information: 
	  
	  The clearest sequence is always to give the summarizing idea before you give the individual ideas being summarized.
	- Place summary up front
		- Provide explanations and details after the summary slides
	- Make sure your objectives and outcomes are clearly stated
	- When doing a monologue create a restful slide full of photos or imagery
	- The presenter’s job is to make the audience clearly  “see” ideas. If your ideas stand out, they’ll be noticed.
	- Take less time that allocated. Get to the point.
	- To make sure the reader finds the one you intended, you must tell him in advance what it is - to make sure he knows what to look for, otherwise he will see an unintended relationship or worse, none at all, in which case you both wasted your time
- Audience
	- Have a clear audience and their needs and purposes in mind when creating a presentation
	- Give your audience:
		- Guidance: What insights and knowledge will help them navigate their journey
		- Confidence: How could you bolster their confidence so they aren't reluctant
		- Tools: What tools, skills, or magical gifts do they gain from you on their journey?
	- Spend a moment in your audience’s shoes. 
	  
	  Walk people through why the initiative matters to them and to the organization, what internal and external factors are driving it, and why their support will make it successful.
	- When segmenting your audience: 
	  
	  Pick the one type of person in the room with the most [[influence]], and write your presentation as if just to that subgroup.
	- Make the presentation about your audience and not how you're performing
- Motivation
	- Create a common purpose or goal when presenting
		- The presenter is so consumed by the mission that he forgets to say why people would want or need to be involved
