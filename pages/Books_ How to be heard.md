		- ^^Not [[Listening]] makes it possible to caricature, depersonalize and demonize people, and that is a long, dark, slippery slope that leads to horrors that we see all too often in a totalitarian society. #ignorance^^

			- **Listening allows us to identify other people's needs and problems. **

		- ^^4 Leeches that rob the power from [[communication]]^^
			- 1. __Looking good__
			  id:: 13bce794-710d-4c8c-b611-93fb8c2b805f
				- We can't learn anything new if we portray the image that we already know everything #overconfidence
				  id:: 63397ac3-b12b-4601-8925-6ee88bb400b7
				- **Speechwriting - Most people do not listen with the intent to understand, we listen with the intent to reply**
				  id:: d51c9bf7-8dbf-4c07-b738-c8c2ffb0987d
					- It ignores what was just said
					  id:: a7c5ea73-8d36-43f8-ba60-4f9899c5e568
				- Competitive Speaking - Replying to a statement with the intention to look better
				  id:: dc0ce121-89b1-4b3e-97ab-de79e354ffea
				- **Embellishment **- **Use specific and intentional words** (use a thesaurus), use "amazing" if it is truly amazing. Overuse of these words will dilute their true meaning and impact in a conversation. 
				  id:: ee53a890-6fe7-49bd-9dca-98204acbec29
					- **Use less intensifiers like "very, super, really"**

			- 2. __Being right__
			  id:: 485df4e5-88af-44bf-a8ef-1890bca24475
				- "Most of our censure of others is only oblique praise of self, uttered to show the wisdom and superiority of the speaker. - Tyron Edwards"
				  id:: 7ee0465a-804e-4d7a-ab74-e7f911324370
				- **The desire to be right often drives us to make other people wrong, which can be destructive in relationships.**
				  id:: 5264af6d-4cdc-45ba-981a-fc20f236cac6
				- ^^Interrupting - common habit that springs from wanting to be right^^
				  id:: 99b7da45-3a5d-473b-8883-7fb97e2a46da
					- We desire to make our point or demand answer __now__
					  id:: 6264d584-5c1c-46ac-a205-5afc80fc5013
					- Interrupting damages the conversation by creating dominance and losing the opportunity listen to the speaker's information that may have been enlightening
					  id:: 233d0c91-59d1-4184-894f-0f5b30887bbd
					- The interrupted will feel belittled, offended giving rise to anger, resentment, and unwillingness to be open from that point. 
					  id:: a4ed6b77-770b-45a3-a173-42fc233740ba

			  id:: 3037baa0-935b-4184-85f9-4054327187e8
				- Becomes fear of rejection or failing due to equating one's own worth with the perceived happiness or approval of others.
				  id:: 74dcbe09-5c82-46c6-886e-a33a992eb550

			- 4. __Fixing__ - For some people, it's not acceptable for others to be upset. Fixing is trying to make it all right. 
			  id:: d8bce6f7-5ba9-4a93-b183-5f0057daa9f6
		- ^^7 Deadly Sins of [[communication]]^^
			- Gossip - speak no evil of an absent friend
			- Condemning
			- **Negativity** - it is simply debilitating to stay around someone who is highly negative. **Be creative and communicate negative ideas into positive ones**
			- Complaining - it is difficult to be around someone who complains often
				- Exercise gratitude to combat complaining
			- Excuses - trying to avoid looking bad, we make excuses
				- Excuses undermines trust
				- Obstruct growth if we refuse to take responsibility for an error or failing
					- An error or failure is most likely to reoccur if we do don't take ownership to fix them.
			- Exaggeration and Lying
			- Dogmatism
				- Internalizing the distinction between opinions and facts is a crucial foundation of humility and necessary for peace coexistence.
				- Use the following phrase "Would you like my opinion on that?"
		- ^^Words to avoid^^
			- **Should **- generally delivers implicit judgement, guilt, or regret.
			- **Just** - do not use as an adverb
			- **But** - replace with "and"
			- You made me - puts us in a position as a victim, powerless, and justified in being upset
		- ^^Maximizers - words that can escalate an argument^^
			- Always
			- Never
			- Everyone
			- Nobody
		- ^^6 Enemies of Communication^^
			- **Assumptions** - Our responses is shaped by our assumptions by our environment and situations we are in.

			- Noise
			- Time - it takes time to listen to someone
			- Semantics

			- Language
			- Values
			- Attitudes
			- Beliefs/Assumptions

			- Intentions
			- Emotions
		- The Inner Voice
		  id:: dc733c31-43b6-4ba1-b868-fa46716ff5ae
			- The experiencing self does our living, experiencing everything in the moment.
			  id:: aba97488-69ba-4d59-a670-8c4526c4b515
			- The **remembering self **summarizes all this experiences, **interprets it and assigns meaning**; it also overstates peaks and valleys and endings in its version of our life experience.
			  
			  **The remembering self is what dominates our view of the world.
			  **
			  This is why we tend to assume that the future will mirror the past, and form biased judgement about the likely outcomes of our current choices. 
			  id:: 60a0e9eb-f5e4-400c-b0b8-1f8121d875c6
			- Exercise to control your inner voice:
			  id:: 0e7ab96b-47da-41d9-ac3e-4c8414bfd065
				- "That's interesting! Why did my inner voice just say that?" - to prevent negative self-talk
				  id:: 03348e03-a2d8-4fa2-8976-0434e2f7faab
				- ^^**Practice positive self-talk.** ^^
				  id:: c0ff102c-a4f7-4d28-bf58-92fbf3607df4
					- **Positive self-talk using the word 'you' or even third person, using your name, is more effective, possibly because it makes us feel that someone else is talking. **
					  id:: c6e5bd55-95bd-4559-9a93-eb0e82388b22
		- [[Created Listening ]]
			- Your part - The contribution of listening is your behavior and way of being.
			  id:: d289f648-0d4b-4b5d-847a-1efa14563985
				- [[Take responsibility for the listening you create through your actions and your words.]]
				  id:: 0aa99664-5e75-4068-a13e-49da412852ba
				- The listening you generate - public, professional, within your organization, among your community or among your friends and your family - determines how you are received when you speaks, and to a large degree what you can accomplish in your life. Take care of it.
				  id:: 59b7489a-8ed2-414c-9e31-095441ceb5d1
			- Their Part:
			  id:: 28a53c36-d623-4c13-a920-5635b22c7a91
				- Other people bring their own filters when they listen.
				  id:: ba393d33-4761-4d9f-9d76-b42831bb1168
		- ^^The **talks that work best** is when the speaker comes with an attitude of [[generosity]], not selfishness. The stance to come with is a belief that you have something you're really excited about that is going to be valuable to people in the audience and your job is to recreate the same in the audience's mind that's in yours. And, to do this effectively you must be clear about what is the core that you want to communicate, and anchor everything your talk to that - to have a crystal clear through-line to the talk, which every element connects to in some way. #[[presentations]]^^
		  id:: 05125390-8e80-47f8-8454-9abb4193b74a
		- I think one of the key things for first-time presenters is to delete most of what you want to say. **Get rid of excess and pick the one thing that is most important and develop it with depth. It's far better to be narrow but deep than broad and shallow.** More a meaningful talk, the author must know why it matters, it's needs to stimulate the curiosity.  [[presentations]]

	- Chapter 4 - **How to listen consciously**
		- __Exercise - Silence__: Be present in complete total silence for at least a few minutes a day
		- Meditate
		- Mixing: In an environment full of discordant noise, intentionally pick a sound and listen to it, while ignoring other sounds.
			- This will increase the quality of your listening.
		- **We listen with our ears, with our eyes, and with our hearts.**
			- The ears are the primary channel for sound and we need to focus our hearing at the subject at hand.
			- __However we must also look at the person we are listening to, and not let our eyes and therefore our minds wander.__ I
				- f you eyes are busy with other tasks,  your listening is degraded because the visual information is incongruent; it displaces attention you would otherwise be giving to the speaker.
			- __Heart - Compassion is the basis of understanding__, which is why it's a vital component of conscious listening.
		- [[Listening positions]]:
			- Change the filters in which you listen and process information. Change your attitudes, biases, and assumptions.
				- Active to passive
					- [[Active Listening]] - involves intention, focus, reflection and summarizing.
					  id:: f7cdab42-31e7-415c-b821-fa216a14ae65
						- The listener must be fully set on the intention of listening with total attention and no interventions, interruptions --whether to correct or attempt to clarify.
						  id:: 4f92edcc-a4e9-44ff-a544-d69b671bf950
						- Focus on what was said and reflect back as near as exactly what was said. 
						  id:: b3318119-6ae1-4ccd-bb03-876c8709048b
							- "What I heard you say..." and then say "Is that right?" to check if the reflection was right. 
							  id:: 54d27b89-c918-40f2-a372-991932fc078a
						- The intention is to leave the the speaker feeling fully heard. 
						  id:: c82da5f9-8e69-46bf-9dbd-305242bddec1
						- To confirm what was heard and confirm understanding
						  id:: fe6f0539-ad26-4c7f-9745-a7d9a82521ed
					- [[Passive Listening]]
						- When you focus on what you're listening to, but aren't doing anything apart from listening.
				- [[Critical listening]] is listening to information analytically and with the intent to assess and discern good vs bad information you are consuming
					- Critical listening can be destructive as it does not facilitate intimacy and is ill suited for emotional communication.
					- The worst type of critical listening is the proclivity to give blame and find fault
				- [[Reductive Listening]]
					- Reductive listening is impatient listening wanting to get to the point straight way (conclusion, the final destination of the conversation).
						- If a reductive listener thinks they know where the conversation is going they will interrupt in order to take the short cut to that end with less wasted time. #overconfidence
					- Reductive listening loves [[problem solving]], gathering facts and generating opinions.
					- This type of listening is very effective for problem solving or finding a solutions to challenges, especially when time is tight.
				- [[Expansive Listening]]
					- Expansive listening is not seeking a resolution or a destination, instead it focuses on the journey itself or focusing being with the other person to share and validate feelings, with little concern to where the journey ends.
					- Expansive listening is curious and inquisitive. It notices small details and can change directions swiftly. It can meander.
					- Expansive listening can be useful in business for brainstorming.
			- **RASA**

			- How do we improve communications with people who are bad listeners and communicators?
		- Listening in [[Sales]]
			- Listen to two domains:
				- Context- The other person's listening for you and your business (past experience with the business, opinions, ask "What do they know about us?")
					- High level goals and current situation of the business
					- Hopes, fears, dreams
				- Cues - Conversational opportunities to match their problem to your solution
					- The other party will ask more information about the product
		- [[Leadership]] Listening
			- Listening while you are talking or presenting

			- ^^Successful business environments allow and don't punish mistakes.^^ #success
			- If we don't try new things or new processes, we get stuck in historical attitudes and behaviors. #innovation
			  id:: 2f1565a9-a975-4eaa-8da8-3302a58f3ac5
			- [[A listening culture is necessary for [[Innovation]] and [[experimentation]] to thrive.]]
			  id:: 6c81aefe-34c6-4669-9788-7c3c5def6236
			- Quotes:
				- When someone is reporting a major [[failure]], an innovative manager will be listening for the positives: the courage to try something new; the imagination in isolating the problem to be solved; the ingenuity involved in engineering a new solution...this is very much listening for the gold, in order to encourage the positive aspects, coach on what went wrong and even assess whether the failure is a failure after all; sometimes just the criteria for success need to be changed. 
				  id:: 40ded33e-8692-42e1-8c5d-2cdbafd2fd75
		- On Speaking/[[presentations]]:
			- Grab your audience by their feelings before attempting to influence their minds and thinking. It matters less much intellect and knowledge you have to share if you can't emotionally connect with your audience.
				- Grab the audience through parables and [[storytelling]] that is deep relatable.

						- To gain advantage over another person
						- To win the admiration and praise from others  by creative a false positive persona
						- Controlling information and therefore controlling people

			- **Speak with clarity**. #speaking #presentations
				- __Use plain language when speaking or writing. __
				- Keep sentences short wherever possible and avoid [[subordinate clause]]s.
				- When assigning goals make them [[SMART]].
				- The objective is to be understood, not sound impressive.
			- Speak directly and with meaning
				- Avoid [[speaking]] indirectly and allusively
					- This type of communication requires the listener to read minds, infer meaning and guess at what the real meaning you said.
					- Often the meaning of the words will be inaccurate in translation
					- Misunderstanding and conflict can arise from indirect, ambigous and vague speech
					- Prefer to use active tense and avoid passive tense
			- Be authentic when speaking
				- To be authentic is to be yourself
			- Transmit integrity in your speech and written communications
				- Be your words, if you say it or write it, make it happen
				- If you do break your [[integrity]], apologize and say what you are putting place to prevent it from happening
			- __Speak out of love__
				- If your words come from a well wishing love, then honesty, authenticity, and integrity flow much more naturally
				- Your communication (written, speeches, or [presentations]([[presentations]])) should be for the benefit of other people and not self-serving
					- People can tell a speaker who is self-absorbed and seeking approval and affirmation #selfish
					- [Selfish](selfish) speaking presents as artificial, thin, and performed
				- If you are focused on the [sucess]([[success]]) of other people (the [[gift]] you are giving for them) and you genuinely feel kindly love towards them, they will listen with much more natural attention and warmth. #Linchpin
				- Consciously generate well-wishes towards people you meet #focus-emotion
			- [Speak into listening]([[speak into listening]])

				- Consider the factors that may effect your audience's listening towards you based on previous engagements, advertisements, and [[reputation]]
			- [Speaking From]([[speaking from]])
				- You may speak from a position, role, concept or feeling that is not your natural self
				- Speaking from a different place is used to manipulate people's emotions to transform their attitudes or move them into action.
					- People tend to buy emotionally rather than rationally #[[Decision Making]]
			- Deliver perfect content
				- Speaking impact comes from delivering content well #speaking #presenting
					- Content + Delivery + Context = Impact
				- ^^Know the intentions for delivering perfect content^^ #presenting
					- Know your intentions for yourself
						- What do you want to achieve?
						- What does success look like, sound like, feel like?
							- Visualize and imagine a successful meeting and write it down
					- ^^Know your intentions for your audience^^
						- What do you want to give to your audience?
						- Is your intention lining up with what what the audience wants from you?
					- Know what the [[audience]] wants or are interested in
						- The audience is not there for you, but what they can get from you
				- ^^Make sure your presentation contains an idea worth spreading^^
					- Ask yourself, what idea am I trying to communicate
					- Why should the audience care?
					- The audience should give to the audience
				- Make sure your presentation addresses the learning types of your audience #Education #audience #learning
					- Model how children [learn]([[learning]]) [[4MAT]]
						- Why - [imaginative]([[imagination]]) learners. They like feeling and watching and making connections, they seek personal associations, meaning and involvement.
						- What - analytical learners. They like listening to and thinking about information and formulating ideas; they seek facts, think thorugh ideas, like to know what the experts say
						- How - Common-sense learners. They like thinking and doing and applying ideas; they experiment, tinker, build and test.
						- What if - Dynamic learners. They like doing and feeling and creating original adaptations; they seek hidden possibilities, explore and use trial and error.
				- __Employ clean language__
					- Strip out language that promotes insinuations, assumptions, and leading the audience to ideas unintentionally ([manipulations]([[manipulation]]))
					- Quote: "I think there is great mileage in being attentive to our language, stripping out the unconscious or conscious manipulations we so often deploy by rephrasing what someone said, asking leading questions, embedding assumptions or generalizations or invalidating the other's point of view."
					- Say what you mean, and asking without leading.
			- [Making Requests]([[making requests]])
				- The requestor must be ready to receive the three types of responses after making a request
					- I refuse
					- I agree
					- I'll think about
						- Place a time limit for the thinking must be agreed by both parties
			- [Presentations]([[presentations]]) and [[slides]] #PowerPoint
				- First use cue cards before starting to create slides
				- Be sure to know what you will say first, don't start with a slide deck to outline your presentation
				- Avoid bulleted slides and writing down all the words you're going to say
					- People read ahead faster than you and will be stuck listening to something they already know
					- The speaker becomes redundant
					- The words need to come from your mouth not your slides
- [[Lessons Learned]]:
	- Be aware of your preferred [[[[listening]] position]]s.
	- When listening, ask yourself "What Am I listening for?"
	- When a problem seems too complicated to approach. Break it down to more actionable pieces.
