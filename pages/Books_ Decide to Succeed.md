- Notes:
	- [[Decision Making]]
		- Business and organizational decisions covers two elements:
			- What will we do?
			- ^^How do we do it?^^
				- focus [[decision risk management]] on [[how]] to [[implement]] the decision
		- [[decision risk management]] is a matter of systematically and effectively addressing [[uncertainty]], [[risk]], and [[opportunity]]
			- As human beings we are [[biased]] to report a better-looking [[outcome]] by underestimating risks and uncertainty
		- ^^Even though we only deal with about 10% of decisions that require consequential explicit consideration, even small decisions will be worth spending a few minutes asking^^ #[[problem statement]] #[[Define the problem]] #[[P - How to define a problem]]
			- ^^what do we want to [[achieve]]?^^
			  id:: af19ae4d-8d2d-493d-aa04-c37fc0ad8028
			- ^^[[how]] will we do that or have it done?^^
			  id:: af2aab9a-9072-4608-a7b7-f27f3605cb31
			- ^^what may block or obstruct--is it [[viable]]?^^

	- [[targeting]]
		- Before thinking about managing and [[risk managing]] a [[decision]] implementation--you need to define what your aim, purpose, is?
			- **The more precise the target--the less risk of running astray, delivering the wrong thing, or nothing at all**
			- ^^Have SMART targets^^
				- **specific** - precise in what we want to achieve that is clear and easy to understand
					- "improving customer service" is not specific and not helpful
				- **measurable** - use clear defined metrics to measure to assess if the final outcome was a [[success]]
				- **attractive **- the target must be describe in away that makes it attractive in order to drive enthusiasm and buy-in from the stakeholders
				- **realistic **- the target is adjusted in connection with planning of the implementation and execution
					- targets that are impossible will not gain much traction and actual performance may be worse that it could have been
					- target which are a walk in the park will not gain attention that it needs and planning must compensate
				- timed - we have to know when we finished and when to make the "after action review"
				- example: "By end of next year, we wish to simplify processing of (whatever) by reducing needed number of steps from the current 8 to 5, and speed this up from the current throughput time of 3 weeks to 2 weeks and thereby free up resources for other tasks."
				- ensure you know the target well enough to make the right [[decisions]]
					- targets must be defined as SMART to be effective and directionally helpful for those working with the implementation/execution of the decision
	- [[changing]] [[decisions]] and [[target]]s
		- changing the target or [[scope]] leads to a new decision
			- make sure to compensate by changing the planning, resource requirements, risk exposure, and update the decision document
- Chapter 3 - Identification
	- to [[ensure]] an adequately valid and realistic [[plan]], we need to build processes to address [[uncertainties]] of the plan.
		- ^^[[identify]] all assumptions and [[define]] these in terms of [[ranges]] rather than single figure estimates ^^

		- [[risk]]s and [[opportunities]] i.e., issues/events/developments which are not planned for need to be defined for both likelihood within a defined time frame and potential consequence range if it occurs
			- the important consideration for identification is never rule anything out.
	- conduct [[stakeholder analysis]] - anyone affected or interested in the outcome of the decisions
		- create a map of stakeholders and consider the [[affect]]s and how they may [[support]] your project
	- Create an [[assumption]]s document of the following:
		- [[resource]] [[availability]] when you need them
		- cost and timing of collaboration with [[external]] partners
		- inter-project dependencies
		- dependencies to other projects/initiatives/ and or operations and other decisions
		- time allocated to each sub-task activity
		- constraints your project maybe subject to
		- (think of other [[assumption]]s that may be relevant to your project)
- [[change management]]
	- **address change management in your projects. Involve those who have to change due to the project in a timely manner. These are the people themselves and not the managers.**
	- Risks and opportunities of change management
		- purpose and value of the initiative is not understood nor accepted by those it affects
		- training is neither adequate nor timely
		- involved staff (end users) come up with ideas that significantly support the benefit of the project and are low-hanging fruits which were not seen earlier
- keep in mind the [[upstream]] and [[downstream]] processes your project is [[interacting]] with
	- ask the people affected for risks and opportunities
- Consider [[PESTEL]] analysis
	- political - issues related to political and regulatory changes
	- environmental - risks and issues related to the environment
	- societal
	- technological
	- economic
	- legislative
	- Consider also:
	- market
- ^^Think broadly - talk to people across organizations to leverage their [[Insight]]s^^
	- look diligently at areas from where [[risk]]s and [[opportunities]] may emerge
- Chapter - Analysis
	- Once [[assumption]]s and [[risk]]s are identified outcomes need to be defined  in terms of ranges
	- **There are two generic ways of gathering insights to assess uncertainty, a risk, or an opportunity**
		- 1. We have relevant data available to make a fact-based analysis to inform our decision document
		- 2. We do not have data to make a fact-based analysis to inform our decision document, so we need to rely on the quantitative assessment of subject matter experts
		- **Avoid the "third" way of: we have no data, and hence we rely on qualitative assessments made by subject matter experts.**
			- This approach is vague and inaccurate, that it does not constitute as a methodology
			- ^^When we do have to  rely on [[subject matter expert]]s, know that their opinions are [[bias]]ed^^ #[[B: Judgment in Managerial Decision Making]] #[[Article: How not to be stupid]]

				- **If using opinions from SMEs consider getting a 3 point estimate of low, expected, and high**
				- ^^**Options to lessen human biases:**^^
					- 1. Use more than one expert
					- 2. Rationale and challenge
						- Ask for the assessment
						- Ask for a narrative description of how the person got to that number
						- Play the Devil's advocate and challenge the assessment. Challenge the range or ask for range of the outcome if not given.
						- Discuss with and probe the expert to provide a well-reasoned assessment.
					- 3. Wisdom of crowds
						- crowd source the question and average the answers
