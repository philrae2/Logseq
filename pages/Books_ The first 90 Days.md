			 - You alienate people who would help

	 - 6. Engaging in the wrong type of [[learning]]
		 - You spend too much time focused on learning about the technical and not enough about cultural and political dimensions of your new role

		 - Build the cultural insight, relationships, and information conduits to understand what's going on 

	 - 7. Neglecting Horizontal [[relationship]]s: 
		 - Spending too much time focused on vertical relationships and not enough on peers and stakeholders

- **Creating Momentum by**:
	 - Informed decisions through informed learning

	 - Informed [[strategy]] through effective [[relationship]] building

- Steps to Transition
	 - Prepare yourself for new competencies

	 - Accelerate learning of:
		 - markets, products, technologies, systems, and structures
			 - Learn about culture and politics

	 - Secure Early wins
		 - Find and identify opportunities to build personal credibility

		 - In the first 90 days, you need to identify ways to create value and improve business results

	 - Negotiate Success: Talk and build a relationship with your boss

	 - Create Alliances (external and internal)

	 - Keep your balance

	 - Accelerate everyone

- Expectations
	 - Understand the key expectations of other key constituents especially if they're likely to influence how you're evaluated and rewarded

- Culture
	 - Understand the culture, culture is not a set of patterns people follow for communicating, thinking and acting, all grounded in their shared assumptions and values

	 - **Identifying cultural norms:**
		 - Influence: How do people get support for critical initiatives?

		 - Meetings: Dialogue of hard issues or public forum?

		 - Execution: Deep understanding of the process or knowing the right people?

		 - Conflict: Can people talk openly about issues without fear

		 - Recognition: Who does the company recognize? Vocal players or team players?

- Your Strengths and Weaknesses
	 - Know what types of problems you like to solve and those you tend to avoid
		 - 1. Technical problems: Strategies, markets, technologies, and processes

		 - 2. Political problems: Power and politics the organization

		 - 3. Cultural problems: involve values, norms, and guiding assumptions

- Accelerate Your Learning
	 - ^^Planning to learn^^
		 - Figure out what important questions to ask in advance and how you can best answer them

		 - One question to ask in systems thinking is "How did we get this way?" to avoid tearing down existing structures or processes without knowing why they put there in the first place. 

		 - Effective leaders balance between doing (making things happen) and being (observing and reflecting). 

		 - When we are onboarding we need to focus on learning and adapting to the new culture to prevent the risk of alienating people and being rejected by others within the organization. 

	 - > Simply displaying a genuine desire to learn and understand translates into increased credibility and influence

	 - **Actionable Insight**
		 - To maximize your return on investment in learning, you must effectively and efficiently extract actionable insights from the massive information available. 

		 - Actionable insight is the knowledge that enables you to make better decisions earlier and so helps you quickly reach break even point in personal value creation

	 - **Learning Agenda**
		 - What do you need most to learn?

		 - ^^A first agenda will be composed of questions, then hypothesis, and then tests to try the hypothesis.^^

	 - **Early Guiding Questions**
		 - Questions about the past, present, and the future
			 - Questions About the Past

	 - The best sources of knowledge
		 - [[customer]]s: How do customers-eternal or internal-perceive your organization? How do your best customers assess your products or services? How about your products or services? How about your customer service?

		 - natural historians: Keep an eye out for "old timers" or natural historians-people who have been with the organization for a long time and who naturally absorb its history

	 - **Agenda vs the Plan**
		 - The learning plan defines how you will go on learning from your agenda

		 - The agenda defines what you want to learn

		 - **Learning Plan for the first 30 days**
			 - Review detailed operation plans, performance data, and personnel data

		 - ^^Ambiguity about goals and expectations are dangerous^^

- Four Pillars of Effective Onboarding
	 - Business Orientation (context)
		 - The sooner you understand the business environment in which you're operating, the quicker you can make productive contributions

	 - Stakeholder development (interpersonal network development)
		 - It's essential to develop the right relationship wiring as soon as possible. Find the key stakeholders and build productive working relationships as quickly as possible.

	 - Alignment of expectations
		 - No matter how well you think you understand what you're expected to do, be sure to check and recheck expectations 

		 - It is also important to understand and factor in the expectations of key constituencies other than your new boss

	 - Cultural adaptation (cultural mastery)

- Onboarding Checklist
	 - **Business Orientation**
		 - As early as possible get access to products, strategy, and the branding (missions, goals) of the company

		 - Schedule meetings, talk to people to learn more about the company

	 - **Stakeholder connection **
		 - Ask your boss to identify and introduce you to key people you should connect with early on

		 - Be careful to focus on lateral relationships (peers, others) and not only vertical ones 

	 - **Expectations alignment**
		 - Understand and engage in business planning and performance management

		 - Clarify expectations from your supervisor

		 - Have explicit conversations about working styles with supervisors as early as possible

	 - **Cultural adaption**
		 - Build relationships within the organization to understand the unspoken and unwritten culture of the organization

		 - Identify people inside the organization who could serve as culture interpreters

		 - Conduct a 360-degree check-in with your supervisor after a month or so

	 - > Work constantly with real challenges of your new position and not retreating to your comfort zone. It is easy to backslide into habits that are both comfortable and dangerous.

	 - **What has made you successful so far in your career? Can you succeed in your new position by relying solely on those strengths? If not,  what are the critical skills you need to develop?**

	 - Are there aspects of your new job that are critical to success but that you prefer not to focus on? Why? How will you compensate for your potential blind spots?

- 3. Match Strategy to Situation
	 - To take charge successfully, we must have a clear understanding of the situation and the implications for what we need to do and how we need to do it.
		 - What kind of change are we called upon to lead?

		 - What kind of change leader are we?

	 - The Four STARS Situations
		 - Here are the four STARS situations according to Watkins:
			 - **Start-up**. You are charged with assembling the capabilities (people, funding and technology) to get a new business, product or project off the ground.

			 - **Turnaround**. You take on a unit or group that is recognized to be in trouble and work to get it back on track.

			 - **Realignment**. Your challenge is to revitalize a unit, product, process or project that is drifting into trouble.

			 - **Sustaining-success**. You are shouldering responsibility for preserving the vitality of a successful organization and taking it to the next level.

	 - 1. Start-up Challenges and Opportunities

	 - Key Take Aways
		 - Here are my key take aways:
			 - Identifying which situation youâ€™re in helps you anticipate what to expect.

			 - Different situations call for different actions.

			 - Having a shared vocabulary for the situations, helps get the team on the same page.

		 - To make the most of your work arena, make sure you understand the situation you are in.Â  Use the four STARS framework (start-ups, turnarounds, realignment, and sustaining-success) to create a shared language with everyone you work with.

		 - To be effective, make sure you understand the key challenges, and opportunities that are unique to each situation.

- Negotiate Success
	 - Proactively engage with your supervisor to shape how to achieve your desired goals with their input, consensus, and support

	 - Focus on the fundamentals
		 - Don't stay away
			 - If you have a boss who doesn't reach out to you, or with whom you have uncomfortable interactions, you will have to reach out yourself. 

			 - Get on your supervisor's calendar

			 - Be sure they are aware of the issues you face and that you are aware of their expectations, especially whether and how they're shifting

		 - Don't surprise your boss
			 - Keep your supervisor updated of any signs of trouble as early as possible

		 - Don't approach your boss only with problems

		 - Don't expect your boss to change

	 - Planning for Five Conversations
		 - The situational diagnosis conversation
			 - Align with your supervisor on the read of your projects and the resulting outcomes you will try to achieve

			 - If you and your boss don't agree on the same definition of your project or situation you will not get the support you need

		 - The expectations conversation
			 - Align and clarify with your supervisor about expectations for the future. You need to agree on short- and medium-term goals and on timing. 

			 - You need to define the meaning success.

		 - The style conversation
			 - How you and your boss can best interact on an ongoing basis. What communication style do they prefer? What kind of decisions should they be consulted on?

		 - The personal development conversation.
			 - Once youâ€™re a few months into your new role, you can begin to discuss how youâ€™re doing and what your developmental priorities should be. Where are you doing well? In what areas do you need to improve or do things differently? Are there projects or special assignments you could undertake (without sacrificing focus)?

		 - Identify the untouchables
			 - Identify processes and projects that you should not try to influence early in your job.

		 - Educate your boss
			 - One of your immediate tasks is to shape your boss's perceptions of what you can and should achieve. You may find their expectations unrealistic, or at odds with your beliefs about what needs to be done. 

	 - When negotiating for resources
		 - Focus on the underlying interests of others. What would they benefit by giving you support?

		 - Look for mutually beneficial exchanges.
			 - Look for resources that are both beneficial to you and your supervisor. Look for ways to help peers advance their agendas in return for help with yours

		 - Link resources to results.
			 - Highlight the performance benefits that will result if more resources are dedicated to your unit

- 5. Secure Early Wins
	 - Early wins excite and energize people and build your personal credibility. Done well, they help you create value for your new organization earlier.

	 - Your early wins should advance your long term goals. (Therefore know your long-term goals)

	 - Plan on multiple successive waves of change. Each wave should consist of distinct phases: learning, designing the changes, building support, implementing the changes, and observing results. 
		 - The first wave helps secure early wins. We tailor early initiatives to build personal credibility, establish key relationships, and identify and harvest low-hanging fruitâ€”the highest-potential opportunities for short-term improvements in organizational performance.
			 - However, your early wins and low hanging fruit should not be in expense of your long-term goals, rather support them. 

			 - Define your end goals in mind and build appropriate automatic behaviors. Use [[Inversion]] to identify unwanted behaviors and define a clear vision of how you like people to behave by the end of your tenure in the job. 

			 - It's important to secure early wins the correct way.
				 - Focus on a few promising opportunities rather than taking on too much.

				 - Secure wins that matter to your supervisor

				 - Get wins the right way. Bet ethical, kind, and collaborative. 

				 - Adjust your win for the culture. Does a win have to be visible for it to matter?

		 - The second wave of change typically addresses more fundamental issues of strategy, structure, systems, and skills to reshape an organization; deeper gains in organizational performance achieved. But we won't get here without securing the early wins. 

	 - Establish your [[reputation]] and [[credibility]], find the balance between over and under asserting yourself by knowing your strengths and weaknesses.
		 - Do you have insights and steadiness to make tough decisions?

		 - Do you have values that they relate to, admire, and want to emulate?

		 - Do you have the right kind of energy?

		 - Do you demand high levels of performance from yourself and others?

		 - You want people to associate you with attractive capabilities, attitudes, and values.
