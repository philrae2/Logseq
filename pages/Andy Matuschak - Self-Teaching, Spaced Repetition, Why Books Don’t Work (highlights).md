	- when people are  interested and it connects to something that's  truly meaningful for them, they really do want  to absorb and we see that in their behavior. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55mg0gvp2kytmeagm2cxhhm))
	- hat there is such  
	  
	  a thing as being a more skillful reader and being  a more skillful reader will actually, in practice,  in many cases, when the reading is aligned with  your actual interests, produce a more serious,  more understanding, forward kind of reading ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55mm3czvmecctw5yd765r64))
	- So there's two models of why people  might fail to retain the material they're  consuming. One is they got it at some point,  but they forgot it. And the other is they never  understood it in the first place and they just  
	  
	  never noticed that they never understood it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55mnqwfw6b7x6a4397e34e4))
	- dler and Van Doren suggest that the  
	  
	  first and most important rule of skillful reading,  active reading, is asking questions and trying to  answer them. If you just dwell on that, what kinds  of questions should I be asking and how should I  go about asking them? How should I go about  answering them when the author isn't present?  And so on and so forth. [Unclear] They also say  conversely, and this is meant as a criticism,  an undemanding reader asks no questions and gets  no answers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55mphkewcpnkztsvrsqhzx2))
	- One enduring result in education psychology  
	  
	  is that when you're doing a lot of cognition,  metacognition is difficult. What I mean by that is  when you're thinking really hard about the stuff  on the page, it's very difficult for you to plan,  to regulate yourself, to figure out what the  best next action to do is, to reflect and  evaluate on whether you're understanding things.  All that gets harder as the material gets harder  
	  
	  and as it gets less familiar. So one common  thread, at least in learning science stuff,  has been outsourced metacognition ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55mtxh3gd8gngk4s7z0cnn9))
	- Some of the  ways we outsource that are actually very familiar,  they're things like somebody gives you a syllabus  and tells you what to read when and you reference  that. That is a user interface, that is a design  practice. If you're a self-motivated student,  one thing you can do and that I've done, is just  go appropriate a syllabus from some graduate level  
	  
	  course that corresponds to the text that you're  reading as that might be a good guide to what's  most important and how to approach this. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55mvgcf7r32xaxabbheshxn))
	- The  adjunct questions have the kind of effects on  forward material I was just describing and they  also have the effect of making you reflect  on what you've just learned. And in addition  to the questions being asked, you might  find yourself pondering, “Well, I'm being  asked about this. But why does this matter?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55nd7ac0b1aawq8n3kby5g8))
	- I think a very  common mistake that people make is to  
	  
	  feel that they need to do the thing the right  way and that is exhaustive and completionist.  If they fail because they find themselves  bored or unmotivated because the material  doesn't actually seem to relate to what they want  to know, but they're just going on faith that,  “Well, if I follow what the author  says, everything will be good.” Anyway,  they find themselves having trouble for that  reason, and then they just stop. This is bad.  
	  
	  They would be better off just skipping around  according to their interest and continuing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55nnyb0byd5ajcg3qtwc55k))
	- I guess this maybe implies that  if you do want to learn about a subject,  it might just be helpful to just do an  Intro to X subject course or textbook,  
	  
	  not necessarily because it is instrumentally  valuable to whatever problem you're interested  in but because it'll give you the context  by which to proceed on, the actual learning ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55s27n3xwxfs8xsaw4js4a7))
	- If your aspiration actually depends  on having a deep, detailed understanding of the  material, then the imprint on your worldview or  on your automatic responses made by the book may  
	  
	  not be sufficient. On the other hand, if what  you want is to absorb a lot of different ways  of looking at the world, knowing the details  of these isn't necessarily important. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55s5nbwyzgbnj80h7taqay9))
	- in order to effectively  compile things that you've learned into schemas  that will match feature scenarios effectively,  you need to be exposed repeatedly to those things,  you need to use them, you need to do a variety of  things that will basically show your brain that  is relevant to apply these things in combination.  And simply reading probably won't do that. But if  you read and you have a lot of conversations and  
	  
	  you're in a context where it's demanding and  it's drawing on what you read, then you may  naturally do that kind of compilation step ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55s9ys62jzfwmerstfwtb2z))
	- Early on in my time in Khan Academy I learned a  whole lot of details about the education market in  a very thorough way using memory systems.  This let me be in high level executive kinds  of conversations where we're trying to figure  out strategy stuff and somebody would propose a  particular direction and I could say things like,  “Well the total budget spending for instructional  materials is this and that market is growing by  this percent per year and 10% of students in the  
	  
	  US are in this place” and so on and so forth.  Basically I could evaluate ideas on the fly  in a way that others couldn’t. Anyway, this  and other things are just part of my rant  about how people in general under-appreciate  the role that memory has in our lives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55tcew8ew9kpvq787t6md31))
	- ack to the learning  point about the role of memory. If what you're  trying to do is to understand something pretty  
	  
	  difficult, your ability to understand that  thing is still absolutely going to be bound  on your memory of the constituent material ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55tfqrshhfdczthnm1kxw0h))
	- Memory is very connected to  attention. And we can't attend everything. So  one of the roles of memory is to help guide  us to the things that are important. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55tgztrefybsd83mxctccmw))
	- So when you repeatedly access  something, when you practice retrieving it,  
	  
	  the prediction of the utility of the thing goes  up. And when you do it in a variety of situations,  it goes up across a broader distribution ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55vj77fdbvjdzakc11negbx))
	- Learning stuff is easier  when you have other stuff to connect to. It's  a nice principle. Metacognitive load on me was  
	  
	  lighter because others were figuring out what  we should be doing. Just like by contrast, now  I'm doing research, I'm trying to discover things  that are not known. I'm trying to make things that  didn't exist. The hard questions that I answer  are mostly, what should be done or what should  I do? And that question is not just a technical  one of how I should implement this feature that  needs to get built, but what intervention on a  reader should be taken? That requires synthesizing  lots of different unfamiliar literature ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55xmwt8faets99naqrx10pn))
	- This  is a bootstrapping argument. One role for  explicit practice of this kind is to get  yourself into a position where you can  more naturalistically reinforce. But there are  still going to be instances where naturalistic  reinforcement isn't going to work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55xt4v108ffbew0kf1xj4e8))
	- or  example, the linking that you brought up,  one issue for doctors is rare diagnosis. So  if it's only going to be once every couple  
	  
	  of years that you see a patient that's  going to present with these symptoms,  that's not going to be frequent enough to  naturally reinforce your memory of that.  You're going to need some out of band mechanism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55xtxw99g3q6wrmrs1mygwe))
	- sitting and staring at a page and  deciding what you should do next on a research  project is incredibly draining on that resource.  The sitting and not knowing is the hardest thing  that I do in my work. It's a wonderful vacation  to be presented with, “Oh great, somebody else is  
	  
	  going to tell me what to do. This is great ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55y0170chd89mz4n9542rn4))
	- So when I was  asking all those questions of the book, that  was active learning, active reading ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55ydmr8dc7najswxdjxcxbz))
	- 'm actually incredibly excited about streaming as  a medium for this. We're gesturing at a particular  kind of learning that needs to happen. It's often  called tacit knowledge. One of the things that you  have to learn to do as an engineer is to learn to  deal with 100,000 different weird situations  where something is not behaving the right way.  Eventually you learn pattern recognition, you  learn ways of dealing with this. Much of this  
	  
	  is not described in any book. It's not explicitly  taught. You just learn it by doing it over a long  period of time. By watching George do it, I think  that people do absorb stuff. They can absorb some  of that knowledge. That's part of how apprentices  absorb that knowledge. There's a few things that  are missing. You're not getting feedback. There's  a whole lot of chaff there. There's a whole lot of  stuff that probably isn't all that meaningful.  It's also true for apprentices. I'm pretty  
	  
	  excited about streaming videos. I've complained  loudly that there aren't more designer streamers. One of the things that I think is really  interesting is that we have some disciplines  like programming where there are a million books  on courses about how to learn to program. They  don't give you everything you need. There's this  tacit knowledge stuff that you need to develop. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55ykyv9392ch0xrfbne69jw))
	- One of the  heroes of the reform school movement is this  
	  
	  philosopher named John Dewey, and he has a  lovely book called Experience and Education,  sort of written near the end of his time, looking  back on all of his efforts to reform schooling in  a kind of unschooling-ish direction. He was  never as extreme as that, but broadly looking  for freedom on the child's part. And he makes  this wonderful argument that because these kids  
	  
	  don’t have a fully developed  prefrontal cortex, certainly don’t have  a fully developed kind of sense of self, to  let them do whatever it is that their whim  commands them to do in any given moment is  actually not freedom, but rather is chaining  them to whatever that impulse is. It makes them  the subject of these tides of impulse. And I think  
	  
	  that's a pretty compelling argument. It doesn't  authorize tyranny, but it also suggests that,  you know, you got to be a little bit skeptical  about the planning or the plans of 12-year-olds,  I guess. How skeptical should one be? I don't  know. I think I would probably have stronger  opinions on that if I had a 12-year-old.  But my instinct as a foolish non-parent  would be something of a mix. I would be interested  in exposing the 12-year-old to lots of topics and  
	  
	  possibilities. I would be voluble in expressing  the consequences of any particular actions. Like  if they just want to compose music all day, we  could talk about like, well, what does that mean?  What kind of life does that look like? I would try  to be non-coercive in this as much as possible.  And I think to some extent, the child should be  allowed to feel the consequences of their choices.

	- At  your time at Apple, you were responsible for a lot  of these cornerstone design features. How is all  that information integrated – taking all of these  constraints into account and deciding that  this is the design? How does that happen? It's very compartmentalized. None of what you just  said was relevant to me. It was all pre-specified.  
	  
	  At Apple, you have a little domain that's  your own, and the boundaries of that domain  are determined by everybody else's little domain.  There's a person who's responsible for thermals.  Actually, there's a team that's responsible  for thermals, and they figure out things  like “What is our thermal budget? How much  can we have the CPU on and during what  kinds of working situations?” I can't argue  with that. Those are just my constraints ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h56r4zs4n6ecjsgvb488jcbm))
	- What I find really interesting about this  is that it's possible for a $2 trillion  company to integrate all this information  to have a cohesive hierarchy where so many  different products, so many different trade offs  are being made. Does that make you think that over  time, these very well functioning tech firms will  get bigger and bigger, that they can actually  handle the cost of having this much overhead? 
	  
	  Let me first just respond to this observation  about the enormity of the company and then we'll  talk about the other firms. The reason Apple  is able to do this is because of the way they  delegate. While there is a very strong command  and control structure, and important decisions  are made by a small group of people at the top,  the individual leaders in various areas at all  levels of hierarchy have an enormous amount  of latitude. That's the only way that any  
	  
	  of this can work. Individual people are given  very, very strong responsibility and authority  within domains to make decisions. That's how  you can have all of these disparate products. Craig Federighi is head of software at Apple.  What does that mean? How can you be head  of software? How many platforms do they have?  iOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, VisionOS, MacOS. There's  also an operating system running in a bunch of  the little chips in the cables. All of that is  
	  
	  under Craig. What does that mean? In practice,  what it means is that there is a set of software  concerns that he's super concerned with and he's  thinking about day to day. When I was at Apple,  I had Craig Federighi in my office talking about  gesture-recognizer heuristics with me, because  that was something that was hyper salient to him.  At the same time, he was basically completely  ignoring 95% of software-related decisions. He  just fully delegated those things to others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h56rbp97agsrjnke3nrxp3gc))
	- There's a really interesting Harvard Business  Review piece from a few years back about Apple's  management structure and how they have different  concentric rings of responsibility for any given  leader. I don't exactly remember the breakdown,  but say there will be 5% of things that you're  responsible for – that you have your hands on  at all times and you are directly manipulating,  controlling. There's a ring outside of that,  that's a little bit bigger. Those are the  things that you're keeping an eye on. They are  salient to you, you're getting reports on them,  
	  
	  you are checking in on them, you are thinking  about them, you're coming up with ideas and  sending them down the chain, but you're not  directly controlling them. Then there's a  bunch of stuff that you've figured out how to  delegate and you want to hear if there's problems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h56rf1hwd26hkaxdgfvtjf0p))
