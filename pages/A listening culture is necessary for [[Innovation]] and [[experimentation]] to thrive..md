- **Note:**
	 - We need to listen well in order to recognize and acknowledge the bright ideas when people share information.

	 - We also need to listen well to allow us to react with humbleness and grace when mistakes happen. If we don't listen well, others will not bring up their mistakes and keep it hidden. Without highlighting our failures and gaps we will remain ignorant and not fix them.
