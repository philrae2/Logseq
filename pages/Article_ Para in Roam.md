	 - How I’m Using Roam for Productivity

	 - But the productivity setup is pretty different. I wasn’t sure at first that I’d be able to use it as a tool for personal productivity, but now that I’ve adapted to it I really love it. I suspect [the structure will change](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/procrustean-bed-productivity), and I love how easy Roam makes it to change things, but this is a good start.

	 - Projects, Areas, Goals

	 - I’ve adapted Tiago’s [PARA system](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/the-p-a-r-a-method-a-universal-system-for-organizing-digital-information-75a9da8bfb37/) to Roam by removing the Resources and Archive sections (you really don’t need them in Roam), and adding a section for Short and Long Term goals.

	 - I’ll start with Areas, those are still in line with Tiago’s definition of “Areas of Focus,” sections of your life that you don’t “complete,” but rather continue to devote mental energy to:

	 - The Areas are great as reference sources and for collecting information and dates. For example all of my notes on Pepper I can quickly tag her on, or anything related to my house can tag the “The House” page.

	 - Areas also help to organize my Short Term Goals (anything roughly less than a year), Long Term Goals (more than a year), and Projects (discrete completable things that feed into my goals).

	 - Then for each week, I create a “weekly plan” with some goals for the week, with specific goals for each day broken out:

	 - Each day I know the top few things I need to do in-line with my Projects and Goals, and if I don’t finish any “other tasks” on a given day I can easily move them to a future day.

	 - I was keeping all the day-to-day productivity in my Daily Notes, but it was too easy to lose things.

	 - And again, I’m trying to keep things very light in the spirit of [my last article](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/procrustean-bed-productivity). But this has made it really easy to track my most important things I need to get done each week relative to my projects and goals, and then each day see what I need to do while taking Daily Notes that don’t interfere with the productivity setup.
