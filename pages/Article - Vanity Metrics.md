- Reference Notes
	- What is a vanity metric?
		- Vanity metrics make us feel good but don’t help us do better work or make better decisions. Vanity metrics put optics before rigor, learning, and transparency. The metric and/or an outcome is heralded as a win, but things don’t add up.
	- Vanity metric problems
		- **Vanity metrics lack context.**
			- Page Views, Daily Active Users, and Sign-Ups mean something but aren’t very helpful in isolation.
				- The reasoning behind the numbers are missing. We don't know why the page views went up, was it due to marketing? Are the numbers sustainable?
			- You need context to make sense of the numbers and whether the metric fits.
		- **Vanity metrics have unclear intent.**
			- Second, we have confusion about the intent of the metric. The definition of the metric may be explicit, but what we are trying to measure is unclear. A classic example here is Return Visits. Did I return to the product because I liked the product? Or because the product was hard to use, and I needed to take a break? Or needed customer service’s help?
			- A great statement of intent covers the fundamental tradeoffs and goals.
		- Vanity metrics do not guide action and learning.
			- If the numbers go up or downs but we don't take any action to remedy the numbers.
			- Examples include not-very actionable metrics include:
			      Average Session Length. It goes up or down. What do you do?
			      New Users (minus acquisition channel). It goes up or down. What do you do?
			      New Followers. It goes up or down. What do you do?
			- Exceptions
				- A metric can be meaningful but not immediately actionable.
				- A metric can be exploratory. We don’t know what to do with it yet.
