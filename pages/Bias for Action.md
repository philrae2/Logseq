	- Before saying yes to to do something
	- Step 1: Do you need to do it?
		- First, just because you can get something done, doesn‚Äôt mean you should.
		  
		  And just because someone has asked you to do something, doesn‚Äôt mean you should do it.
		  
		  **Before you agree to do something, remember that for every request you say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to, you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to something else. Is that trade\-off worth it?**
		  
		  Here are a few more questions you can ask yourself:
		  
		  If you are a manager: how important is it for you yourself to do it? Instead, can you delegate it to one of your direct reports?
		  
		  If you are an individual contributor: is the task in harmony with what your manager‚Äôs priorities are? Is it in the company‚Äôs best interest?* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4rg6rafgyj8a1w6byzj8ge0))
	- Step 2a: Is this the best thing I can be doing with my time right now?
		- If you have decided that it is, indeed, worth it to do the task and that it‚Äôs in the company‚Äôs best interest, the next step is to ask yourself: Is this the most important task on my plate right now? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4rgh2fytdf7sfap7sa8mqha))
		- Here is a framework for figuring out your actions towards goals:
		  
		  Look at your company‚Äôs goals. This can exist in the form of an MVV (Mission, Vision, Values), OKRs and KPIs, or a Product Roadmap if your company is pre\-product market fit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4rghdve2356hbgm6pbc0yk7))
	- Step 2b: Example: company goals ‚Üí personal work goals ‚Üí action
		- (If you like seeing real\-life examples, continue reading. Otherwise, skip to the next section.)
		  
		  Below are screenshots from my own personal actions tracker. I answer the following questions, step by step:
		  
		  What are the company goals?
		  
		  Based on those goals, what should my work goals be?
		  
		  What are the actions I can do to finish those goals? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4rgw686dxrmrg43y954taab))

	- Here is how I‚Äôve chosen my Actions Towards Goals (notice that each section has one action item: product, people, and self.)

	- And as a result, here is what I choose to do daily because it is the best use of my time:

	- I reevaluate this list of priorities on a weekly basis to make sure I‚Äôm still on track. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4rgydy7mkr6cm44maxc5x4x))
	- Step 3a: How can I make this action happen in the next 30 minutes? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4rh2k6cvfrr7wzjatrq6bj7))
	- One of the biggest hurdles of having a bias towards action is expecting perfection right from the get\-go.
	  
	  Rather than ...
	  
	  jumping down the rabbit hole of hypothetical ‚Äúwhat\-ifs‚Äù that never happen, or
	  
	  waiting to ship until a product is utterly perfect,
	  
	  ...instead, optimizing for getting something in front of an audience and iterating from there is the best way to make progress towards goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4rh4bvrvazykzw3cpcvtzr0))
	- Step 3b: Example: Ship it faster than an MVP ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4rh7nawhd0pgxg1yrq75wfe))

	- Step 4: What can I accomplish before someone assigns me an action?
	  
	  The final step (Frank Slootman‚Äôs mantra on double\-steroids) is:
	  
	  What action items can I give myself and do to make this goal happen before anyone assigns me an action item?
	  
	  An operator‚Äôs greatest superpower is being able to predict the needs of the organization before anyone asks them to do it.
	  
	  This means preemptively going through the logic tree in [Step 2a](https://chiefs\-of\-staff.notion.site/730451d4d9324001b0104911911e3581#8dfd760d10f3448fa116b530e84bfa8d) and giving yourself action items to act on before anyone else does it for you.
	  
	  This is shockingly simple to implement. All you have to do is ask yourself what actions you need to take to reach the goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4rw81r72qndwp8ck9qzgxyn))
