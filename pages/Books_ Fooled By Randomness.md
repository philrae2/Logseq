- ^^Be aware of luck playing in your circumstances and stay [[humble]] in your performance and decision making. Place some allowance when [[reflecting]] and [[analyzing]] your [[decision]]s on how [[luck]] played a role in your [[performance]].^^
	 - if you don't have a clear view of your [[skill]] level, you can make [[bad decision]]s.

		 - ^^build [[feedback loop]]s in your workflow^^

- [[Risky]] [[behavior]] and [[decision]]s may pay off but they can also blowup and cause you to [[lose]] everything
	 - [[lucky]] fools don't know how much luck has played in their risky performance and are not self-aware that they are in that category
		 - they will fool themselves that their strings of successes is due to their abilities and skills

- ^^Risk-conscious hard work and discipline lead with high reliability to a comfortable life. Beyond that, it‚Äôs high randomness.^^
	 - mild success is [[skill]]s while wild [[success]] is [[risk]]y [[variance]] and [[random]]ness

- Almost no one can conceal their emotions. Behavioral scientists believe that one of the main reason why people become [[leader]]s is not from [[skill]]s they seem to possess, but from what extremely superficial [[impression]] they make on others through hardly perceptible signals--what we call today as [[charisma]]
	 - There is evidence of a link between [[leadership]] and a form of psychopathology (the sociopath) that encourages the non-blinking, self-confident, insensitive person to rally followers. 

- The concept of [[[[alternative]] histories]] is particularly interesting. If you were to relive a set of events 1000 times, what would the range of outcomes be? If there is very little [[variance]] in your alternative histories (i.e. You chose to become a dentist and you will probably make more or less the same amount of money and live a similar lifestyle all 1000 times), then you are in a relatively non- random situation. Meanwhile, if there is a very wide range of normal results when considering 1,000 variations (entrepreneurs, traders, etc.), then it is a very random situation [[James Clear]]
	 - ^^One cannot judge a performance in any given field (war, politics, medicine, investments) by [[result]]s, but the [[cost]]s of the [[alternative]] (i.e., if history played out a different way)^^
		 - ^^The [[quality]] of a [[choice]] cannot be [[judged]] just by the result. (I first learned this in baseball. Just because a pitch you call or play you call doesn't work out doesn't make it a poor choice. It could have been the right call, but bad luck. Or vice versa.)^^

	 - [[alternative histories]] can be illustrated through [[Russian roulette]], where five outcomes are good while the other one is death. The survivorship bias, will obscure or hide the cost of one of the alternative history, death.

	 - ‚ÄúCertainty is something that is likely to take place across the highest number of different alternative histories. Uncertainty concerns events that should take place in the lowest number of them.‚Äù 

- When [[Decision Making]] look for the [[risk]]s in the system and create processes in your workflow to [[prevent]] all risks including [[invisible]] risks from happening

- ^^MBA, business type individuals will tend to favor a simplified view of the situation. People will be attracted to the more vivid, relatable presentation of a system or situation rather than the more [[complex]], abstract portrayal of the same system^^
	 - ^^Our [[mind]]s tend to be attracted to superficial clues when dealing with [[risk]]s and [[probabilities]], these clues largely determined by what emotions they elicit or the ease which they come to mind. #[[recency bias]] #[[Availability Heuristic]]^^
		 - You should think carefully about getting more [[insurance]] / shielding yourself from events that ‚Äî although unlikely ‚Äî could be [[catastrophic]]. You essentially want to insulate yourself from terrible random [[accident]]s.

		 - Both risk [[detection]] and risk [[avoidance]] are largely mediated in the emotional parts of our brain and not in the "thinking" parts.
			 - **Risk avoidance has little to do with rational thinking but emotional ones. Much of our rational thinking seems to do is rationalize one's actions by fitting some logic to them. **
				 - The [[news]] [[media]] will often play into these biases by [[sensationalizing]] stories of doom and gloom to sell stories. Though the risks of these events happening are realistically low. 

			 - Beware the confusion between [[correctness]] and [[intelligibility]]. People will favor [[explanation]]s that are simple and [[understandable]] instantly.

- **epiphenomenalism **- when one has the illusion of cause and effect. For example a risk manager has less to do with actual risk reduction than it has to do with impression of risk reduction

- [[Saying]]s, [[proverb]]s, and simplified generalizations are not to be trusted. [[Simplification]]s of problems and systems are problematic and should be met with [[skepticism]]. 

- [[stochastic]] processes refer to the dynamics of events unfolding with the course of time. stochastic is a fancy Greek name for [[random]]
	 - This branch of [[probability]] concerns itself with the study of the evolution of successive random events. 

- We tend to not [[learn]] from [[history]], either from ourselves or others, without intention
id:: ab72d362-9d27-4277-925d-0dee5bc9bce0
	 - We overvalue shallow recent history, with statements  like "this has never happened before" but not form history in general (things that never happened before in one area tend eventually to happen)
id:: d786c5e9-54a5-4619-b59e-5684820c671d

	 - **It's better to value old, distilled thoughts than ‚Äúnew thinking‚Äù because for an idea to last so long it must be good. That is, old ideas have had to stand the test of time. New ideas have not. Some new ideas will end up lasting, but most will not.**

- ^^[[mistake]]s are not something to be determined after the fact, but in the light of the information until that point #[[Hindsight Bias]]^^
	 - ^^a vicious effect of hindsight bias is that those who are very good at [[predicting]] the [[past]],really a misnomer, will think of themselves good at predicting the [[future]] and feel confident about their ability to do so.^^

- The problem with [[information]] is not that it is diverting and generally useless, but it is [[toxic]]. 
	 - the hours spent on studying the [[news]] last month neither had any [[predict]]ive ability during your activities of the month nor did it impact your current knowledge of the world. People often think that it will be the next batch of news that will really make a difference to their [[understanding]] of things
		 - We are so mentally wired to overvalue the sensational stories that you can ‚Äúrealize informational gains by dispensing with the news.‚Äù

- People who look too closely at randomness burn out, their emotions drained by the series of pangs they experience.
	 - **Don't watch too close or monitor the news frequently as you are exposed more to the noise than signals. Important news will come to you without being drained by its negativity if observed too frequently**

	 - Be aware of the time scale of an event and the signal vs noise ratio.
		 - Much of what is[[ randomness]] is timing. The best [[strategy]] for a given time period is often not the best strategy overall. In any given cycle, certain places will be dangerous, certain trading strategies will be fruitful, etc.
			 - Randomness means there are some strategies that work well for any given cycle (an extreme fad diet), but these cycles are often short to medium term successes. More importantly, the strategies that work for a given cycle in the short term may not be the best for long run. They are sub optimal strategies winning over a randomly beneficial short term cycle. The same can said for setting huge goals, following a fad diet, chasing an extreme training protocol, and so on. Unsustainable and suboptimal for the long term. In this way, evolutionary traits that are undesirable can survive for a period of time in any given population. That is, suboptimal strategies and traits can seem desirable in the short run even though they will be resoundingly defeated in the long run.

		 - Important point: you can never affirm a statement, merely confirm its rejection. There is a big difference between ‚Äúthis has never happened‚Äù and ‚Äúthis will ever happen.‚Äù You can say the first, but never truly confirm the second. It just takes one counter example to prove all previous observations wrong. We never know things for sure, only with varying degrees of certainty.

- [[traits]] and [[characteristics]] of [[randomness]] fools
	 - [[overestimate]] the [[accuracy]] of their [[belief]]s: they never considered that the past environment and its variables worked in the past may have been merely coincidental or perhaps even, randomness was being masked or hidden

	 - ^^[[loyalty]] to [[ideas]] is not a good thing for anyone^^

	 - no precise plan ahead of time as to do in the event of losses or [[failure]]s
		 - they are not aware of the [[possibility]] of [[failure]]

	 - absence of [[Critical Thinking]] expressed in absence of [[revision]] or [[course correction]]
		 - be aware and [[humble]] that your methods maybe incorrect or your framework to determine value maybe wrong

	 - [[denial]]: be humble and sense the wrongness or mistake of a [[decision]] early enough before the consequences are [[irreversible]]

- There is nothing wrong with losing. The problem is losing more than you plan to lose. You need clear rules that limit your downside. (‚ÄúIf any investment loses one million dollars then our firm sells immediately.‚Äù)

- [[asymmetry]] for example in a type of cancer the average time to death is 8 years, but those who die after 8 years live much longer up to the age of 78. When asymmetry is present in the environment the [[survival]] has nothing to do with [[median]] survival
	 - **asymmetric odds means that probabilities are not 50% for each event, but that the probability on one side is higher than the the probability on the other. Asymmetric outcomes mean that the payoffs are not equal**
id:: 004b6363-5aaa-41a7-b2e8-5592eff0793f

	 - when making [[bet]]s or [[decision]]s?, make sure that the cost of being wrong  are limited and the probability is not derived from the past

- ^^**Rare events are not fairly valued, and that the rarer the event, the more undervalued it will be in price. **^^

- People tend to be sensitive to the presence or absence of a given stimulus rather than its magnitude. This implies that a loss is first perceived as just a loss, with further implications later. The same with profits. The agent would prefer the number of gains to be high, rather than optimizing the total performance. 

- [[social treadmill]] to avoid comparing [[yourselves]] to better performers, move away from their presence and surround yourself with people near or below your level 

- ^^Science and strict [[empiricism]] should not be taken as seriously as it sounds. There are only two types of [[theories]]:^^
	 - **1. Theories that are known to be wrong, as they were tested and adequately rejected**

	 - **2. Theories that have not yet been known to be wrong, not falsified yet, but are exposed to be proved wrong**

	 - Why is a theory never right?
		 - ^^Theories can never be [[falsifiable]]. A theory cannot be [[verified]], it can only be provisionally accepted. A theory that falls outside this category is not a theory. ^^
			 - A theory that does not present a set of conditions under which it would be considered wrong would be termed charlatanism--it would be impossible to reject otherwise.

		 - ^^[[science]] is mere [[speculation]], mere formulation of [[conjecture]]^^

	 - ^^[[knowledge]] does not always increase with incremental [[information]] - which is the foundation of [[statistical inference]], it does in some cases, but we cannot be sure of which ones.  ^^

	 - [[induction]] and [[memory]]
		 - induction is going from plenty of particulars to the general, it helps someone easily memorize generals than a collection of particulars. However, the effect of this compression is the reduction of the degree of detected [[randomness]].

	 - ^^a small knowledge of [[probability]] can lead to worse results than no knowledge at all^^; this is applicable to all types of information and #[[decision making]]

	 - ^^in environments of pure [[luck]] and where we are not aware of how much luck plays into the [[success]] of players in that environment, we may attribute success to [[skill]]s, [[intelligence]] and [[talent]] to a person and give him influence over others, even though the success was fueled purely by luck^^
		 - in an environment based mostly on luck, even when the players are terrible, a few will rise to be successful

		 - **the length of success is also dependent on the original sample size, the larger the group of people the longer career of individual lucky players will be **

		 - ^^nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his [[failure]]^^

		 - [[survivor bias]] depends on the size of the initial [[population]], without knowing the initial size of a group, we wouldn't be able to verify the track  record or [[success]] of a surviving individual
			 - there is a high chance that an investment coming to you is spurious. This is called [[adverse selection]], judging an investment that comes to you requires stringent standards than judging an investment you seek, owing to such selection bias.
				 - For example, by going to a cohort composed of 10,000 managers, I have 2/100 chances of finding a spurious survivor. By staying home and answering my doorbell, the chance of the soliciting party being a spurious survivor is closer to the 100%

		 - real [[randomness]] does not look random

	 - [[normative]] science - offers [[prescriptive]] teachings; it studies how things should be. 

	 - don't put too much [[confidence]] on small sample sizes when making decisions or formulating attributes

	 - [[emotion]]s helps us make decisions. Our emotional brains are more connected to our cognitive parts of the brain than the reverse

	 - Don't be easily be misled by [[framing]] of statistical probabilities, frame the statements in multiple ways
		 - For example: Only 10% of men who brutalize their wife go on to murder them as opposed to 50% of men who murder their wives previously brutalize them, regarding the OJ Simpson trial. The first statement is wrong because we know the wife was already killed, so the second framing is the correct conditional statement. 
			 - be aware of the [[condition]] that is being framed in statistical statements 

- Be aware of [[significance]] and [[causality]] when assessing information

- Quote: Don't be overconfident that you are intelligent enough or strong enough to fight your [[emotion]]s. Besides we need our emotions to formulate our ideas and get the energy to execute them
	 - we have a predisposition to be fooled by [[randomness]] 

- [[Wittgenstein's ruler]]: unless you have confidence in the ruler's reliability, if you use a ruler to measure a table you may also be using the table to measure the ruler. Be careful how you take significance from information or feedback from sources you may or may not find credible

- We are not made to view things as [[independent]] from each other. When viewing two events A and B, it is hard not to assume that A causes B, B bcauses A, or both cause each other. Our bias is immediately to establish a causal link. 

- [[probability]] is not about odds, but about the belief in the existence of an alternative outcome, cause, or motive. 

- ^^learn not to be married to your ideas. It's okay to [[contradict]] yourself and change your mind^^

- science is great, but scientists are dangerous because they are human

- ^^research on [[happiness]] shows that those who live under self-imposed pressure to be [[optimal]] in their enjoyment things suffer a measure of distress^^
