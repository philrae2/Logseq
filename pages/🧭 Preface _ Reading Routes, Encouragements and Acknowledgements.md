title: ðŸ§­ Preface | Reading Routes, Encouragements and Acknowledgements
---

- Reading Routes
	 - People expect conscientiousness from project managers. But what really dictates project success is [shot selection](((7bdcd1a5-1caa-4979-a966-de8ac0abc77b))). All of us will have more ideas than time and resources to bring them to reality. My goal in this rBook to share the tools to help in better shot selection.
		 - My goal in this section is to help you select your shots in reading this rBook. Below, I present the different types and approximate sizes of the chapters, and I suggest routes based on different situations.

	 - Chapter types
		 - ðŸ§­ Compass chapters aim to contextualize the ideas in this rBook

		 - ðŸ§° Toolbox chapters aim to share project management tools

		 - âž• Appendices are non-essential to learning project management but may be interesting to some

	 - Routes
		 - **If you are new to project management**, it is best to go from Chapter 1 to 5 in order, and follow your curiosity for the later chapters.
			 - If you are currently managing your first project and are pressed for time, I suggest starting with these two chapters:
				 - [[ðŸ§° Chapter 5 | The Heart of Project Management: The WBS]]

				 - [[ðŸ§° Chapter 8 | How to Not Fail: The RBS and The Risk Register]]

				 - Then check [[ðŸ§­ Chapter 3 | 10 Project Management Problems and 10 Project Management Tools]] to see which chapters are most applicable to your situation.

			 - If you are not yet managing any project, I suggest to at least plan a simple project, like a party or some house improvement, and __overmanage__ it with these tools. In real life, you'd want to use a minimum effective stack of tools for each project. [[Choosing a project management stack is a tradeoff between thoroughness and time.]] You'd want to have some hands-on experience with each tool, so that you'll develop an instinct of when to use them. It is easiest to do this with a small and simple project.

		 - **If you are an experienced project manager**, just follow your curiosity.
			 - [[ðŸ§­ Chapter 4 | Project Management Work Best Done With Roam]] presents which parts of project management work I found to work best with Roam. I demonstrate usage in the toolbox chapters.

			 - We learn best when we are solving actual problems. [[ðŸ§­ Chapter 3 | 10 Project Management Problems and 10 Project Management Tools]] is a guide to the project management problems that these tools are used to solve.

		 - **If you are working on your own projects**, [[ðŸ§° Chapter 9 | Designing Serendipity: How to Systematically Get Lucky]] will be more relevant to you than it would be if you were employed. I have never seen luck discussed in any project management book, but it is of supreme importance in building your own business.

		 - You will probably find [[ðŸ§° Chapter 12: Project-driven Stallion\Rider Productivity]] useful** if you work solo or you are looking for an alternative to **[GTD](((8784a3f4-af49-400f-8fe7-ddd28dd17c6b))). **If you are a productivity nerd**, I am proud to present the culmination of many years of trial-and-error in this chapter.

- Encouragements
	 - Making it real
		 - Project management is a practical skill. Real learning only happens when we get hands-on experience with these tools. The best scenario is to use these tools one-by-one on real projects of yours. The next best scenario is to overmanage a small and simple project with these tools.
			 - I hope you find the [[Maximize your learning]] sections useful. They either present exercises to apply the tools presented in the chapter, or act as a kind of highlight: the questions are a way for me point out what I think is important in that chapter.

			 - I attempt to [[design for the extremes]] in this rBook. I am aiming for this rBook to be useful for project managers and Roam users of any experience level. More experienced users and project mangers could always skip sections they find too basic.

	 - [[working with the garage door open]]
		 - I learn best when I immediately share things that resonate with me. Might this work for you as well? Please don't hesitate to share excerpts or screenshots of this rBook in social media. I probably already shared it as I was writing this rBook!
			 - If you are sharing in Twitter, it would be great if you could tag me @Roamfu. Knowing what resonates with people will help me write the next version of this book.
				 - If you find anything unclear, I'm happy to discuss in Twitter as well. This is also helpful for revising this version. This is one of the first rBooks. A lot of the things I do here are experimental. I would love to hear how all the referencing, indenting and embedding translate into your reading and learning experience.
					 - If you purchased this rBook, you will also receive an invite to a Discord server where we can also discuss project management.

			 - As explained in [[ðŸ§° Chapter 7 | Get Support, Get Work Done and Get Lucky: Stakeholder Communications]], learning in public will make us both luckier!

- Acknowledgements
	 - First of all, thank you, dear reader, for downloading or purchasing this rBook. I thought I would start writing books only in my 50s'. That got advanced a decade ahead because of your encouragement and support.

	 - Thanks to Mozart Reina for introducing me to __How to Take Smart Notes__ and Roam Research back in [[January 22, 2020]].

	 - Thank you Sonke Ahrens for showing us a systematic way of crafting non-fiction books.
		 - Another writer I need to thank is Rob Fitzpatrick. While Ahrens' __How to Take Smart Notes__ showed me a model of capturing and organizing ideas, Rob's __Write Useful Books__ presented a method of writing books through [customer development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_development). Rob's book also made me see the viability of working as an independent writer of non-fiction. #.book-recommendation

	 - Thanks as well to the creators of Roam for giving us this beautiful piece of software.
		 - The contents of this rBook is a result of the style of project management that Roam has enabled.
			 - I share in the [prologue](((4dba9934-8f50-45d2-87e6-4c6177198ed9))) and the [epilogue](((88413293-03c2-4aff-8b3a-a861a4cc677c))) how the usage of Roam has changed how I think about projects.

		 - The format in which this rBook is written is also possible thanks to Roam.

	 - I also have to thank the community surrounding Roam Research. You are some of the friendliest, most erudite and most passionate people I've met in the internet.
		 - In particular, I'd like to thank the creator [RoamBrain.com](http://www.roambrain.com), Francis Miller. My articles that he edited and published built the momentum for writing this rBook. I'd also like to thank Ramses Oudt, the creator of [RoamStack.com](https://roamstack.com/), for [this tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1274427778495139840) that made me realize that I should share my project management experience. Thanks as well to the co-founder of Roam, Conor White-Sullivan, not only for Roam but for #RoamGames, which propelled me to write the first four chapters of this rBook and commit to its completion.

- [[Next chapter]]
	 - [The previous chapter]([[ðŸ§­ Prologue | Why I Wrote This rBook: Project Management Freed Me From the Mental Prison of the Pandemic]]) tells why I'm writing this rBook. But why should you read this and learn professional project management? We will answer that in the next chapter: [[ðŸ§­ Chapter 1 | Why Learn Professional Project Management]]
