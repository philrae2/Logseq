	- From our interviews *six* key responsibilities emerged: setting the direction, aligning the organization, mobilizing through leaders, engaging the board, connecting with stakeholders, and managing personal effectiveness. And each of these responsibilities had a number of sub-elements. For example, setting the direction has sub-elements related to choosing the vision, deciding on the strategy, and allocating resources. Aligning the organization has facets related to culture, organization design, and talent management. And so on. As we kept interviewing CEOs, they time and again validated our conclusion that the six responsibilities and their sub-elements were all important to being successful in the role.

	  These six responsibilities aren‚Äôt unique to the best CEOs‚Äîthey just describe fully what the job is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17hm1qesy5c5xeeh7se3p47))
	- What *is* unique to the best is the mindset with which they approach each of the six responsibilities, and the actions they take on each sub-element. These are what enable great CEOs to, in the words of Eaton‚Äôs former CEO Sandy Cutler, ‚Äú**play big ball, not small ball. By that I mean spending time on things that no one else can in ways that magnify your effectiveness without getting mired in things that don‚Äôt make a difference**.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17j28q39fj7ggfxxpq43ydk))
	- After looking hard at the data, we concluded that there is no clear pattern. How the CEOs prioritize each of the six responsibilities depends on a complex interplay between the specific business situation and the CEO‚Äôs unique capabilities and preferences. The key takeaway was that despite their different approaches, every CEO at every stage of their tenure meaningfully tended to all six responsibilities. The best CEOs kept all six plates spinning at all times, even if the external and internal environment meant that some needed to be spun faster or slower than others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17j88gs82t4jx17ar6z2dbb))
	- we found the best CEOs exhibit no such pattern. They instead create significant value on a sustained basis year after year during their tenures. They do so by periodically redefining what it means to win and refreshing their strategies with new, bold actions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17jk7hbp81srm8t8ncxtgmp))
		- **Note**: The pattern among some CEOs was they performed well the first year and slumped their sophomore years and junior years and later recovered on their more senior years.
		- The best CEOs performed consistently through their tenure.
	- **‚ÄúThe CEO role is the intersection of all contradictions.‚Äù** Interview after interview brought to light the kinds of contradictions Aschenbroich was referring to. **Delivering short-term results versus investing in long-term performance. Taking time to gather facts and do analyses versus moving fast to capture opportunities. Respecting the past and creating continuity vs. disrupting the future. Maximizing value for shareholders versus delivering impact for other stakeholders. Having confidence to make tough calls versus having humility to ask for and receive feedback.** You might say that F. Scott Fitzgerald‚Äôs observation that ‚Äúthe test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function‚Äù applies fully to the role of the CEO. As we‚Äôll see in the chapters to come, the best CEOs masterfully reconcile these apparent contradictions to create positive and mutually reinforcing outcomes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17jxfa0d4s2egbyate6nwm2))
	- **Keep in mind that we‚Äôre not suggesting that the best CEOs excel in *every* aspect of the role‚Äîin fact, we‚Äôve yet to meet one who does. Rather, the best CEOs are excellent in a few areas, and do a solid if not exemplary job in the others.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17mbw8301g546w1p3c2ra6v))
	- In today‚Äôs complex world, many CEOs try to minimize uncertainty and guard against making mistakes. It sounds sensible. After all, the old adage that ‚Äúdiscretion is the better part of valor‚Äù would seem to make sense for a job that has such a huge impact on a company‚Äôs stakeholders. Ultimately, however, such a cautious mindset has proven to deliver results that follow the dreaded ‚Äúhockey stick‚Äù effect, consisting of a dip in next year‚Äôs budget followed by the promise of success, which never occurs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17me5rv1pfk6jhpd5k577ck))
		- **Note**: How is this mindset demonstrated in OBI and our self?
	- The best CEOs recognize this dynamic and, in turn, approach setting the direction of their company with a different mindset. **They embrace uncertainty with a view that fortune favors the bold. They‚Äôre less a ‚Äútaker‚Äù of their fate and more a ‚Äúshaper‚Äù‚Äîconstantly looking for and acting on opportunities that bend the curve of history.** CEOs who embrace this mindset are well aware that only 10 percent of companies create 90 percent of the total economic profit (profit after subtracting the cost of capital) and that the top quintile performers deliver thirty times more economic profit than the companies in the next three quintiles combined. And here‚Äôs the kicker: The odds of moving from being an average performer to a top-quintile performer over a ten-year period are only one in twelve.[12](#ch00note-12) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17mdk37e751rgtsdzxwvkjj))
	- Knowing just how low the odds of success are, the best CEOs apply boldness to each of the three dimensions of direction setting‚Äîvision, strategy, and resource allocation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17mftxcsxw9fg43zn374eyp))
	- **As we spoke to the most successful CEOs, we were struck by how they similarly reframed what winning meant for their companies. They didn‚Äôt just raise aspiration levels; they changed the definition of success.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17mh9m55zm4dwqvcfamsdt4))
	- Mastercard‚Äôs former CEO Ajay Banga, for example, shares his game-changing vision and how it came about: ‚ÄúI was walking through the office and saw this slogan written in a staircase: ‚ÄòMastercard, the heart of commerce.‚Äô It made me think, ‚ÄòBut commerce is mostly in cash, right?‚Äô I realized that in the company nobody talked about cash. If anything, they talked about Visa and Amex and China UnionPay and local schemes.
	  
	  ‚ÄúThat led me,‚Äù he continues, ‚Äúto figure out the percentage of transactions in the world that were happening with cash. That number exceeded eighty-five percent just for consumer transactions. From then on I talked about our vision as being to ‚Äòkill cash.‚Äô Instead of fighting for a piece of the fifteen percent of transactions that were electronic, we fought for a piece of the eighty-five that weren‚Äôt (yet). We then converted the vision of killing cash into strategies for growing the core, diversifying our client base, and building new businesses.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17mjbmyrc94sfrp2p2s4973))
		- **Note**: This is an example of creating your own space where no one is competing. Instead for fighting for a piece of a pie, create your own. Reference the book Marketing Saves the World.

	- The best CEOs build their vision by looking for where various aspects of their business and the market intersect. Hubert Joly, the former CEO of electronics retailer Best Buy, explains that setting the right course is, ‚Äúat the intersection of four circles: what the world needs, what you are good at, what you are passionate about, and how you can make money.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17mz0ca3zrhby5jj4nxa4vr))
		- **Note**: To market yourself identify the needs of your workplace and what you can offer to create value.

	- Looking back at the boldly framed visions in table 1, it‚Äôs striking that none of these successful companies focused on achieving financial outcomes‚Äîprofits were an outcome of achieving their vision. Oliver B√§te, CEO of the world‚Äôs largest insurance company, Allianz, explains why: ‚ÄúNobody gets galvanized by, ‚ÄòI need to double net profit.‚Äô Sorry, even my top team doesn‚Äôt. So the question is, what can you rally people behind? It‚Äôs really different to tell people, ‚ÄòWe want to be the loyalty leader in everything we do,‚Äô than, ‚ÄòWe want to double return to shareholders.‚Äô‚Ää‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17qsbt71xakk3z6ytt6bawt))

	- Our most important metrics weren‚Äôt revenues and profits but how many seconds it would take until someone else was helped by a Medtronic product. When I joined the company, it was one hundred seconds. When I left the company, it was seven.‚Äù The focus on restoring people to full life and health and letting shareholder value creation be an outcome of that creates a powerful motivation far beyond making money ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17yygwqem5gtym7r1ydg0v1))
	- Reframing the game doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean creating a vision that departs from a company‚Äôs heritage. Our research found that the best CEOs often dig back into a company‚Äôs history to find out what originally made it successful and then take that central idea and expand it in ways that open up new opportunities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17yz2tc7w3jq4g3mc949yap))
	- Smith‚Äôs advice to new CEOs is to have ‚Äúa vision that is so clear a leader doesn‚Äôt have to do anything but get out of the way. That‚Äôs the most inspiring vision of all.‚Äù[16](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/56709668#ch00note-16) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17z42grf831bf48ty8hpwfp))
	- As the leader, you have the power‚Äîand the responsibility‚Äîto raise the level of ambition in your organization.‚Äù Raising the ambition level isn‚Äôt just about the vision, however. It involves a highly inclusive process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17z52ah7ggrwtzva4g563pm))
	- Involve a Broad Group of Leaders
	  
	  The best CEOs create a game-changing vision for their company. When it comes to sharing it with the organization, however, they rarely dictate their views. Why? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17z7nxmyv3t0wed4p28xqxc))
	- people support what they help create.‚Äù In fact, they‚Äôre some five times more supportive than those who aren‚Äôt involved. The underlying psychology relates to our desire for control, which is a deep-rooted survival instinct. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17z7d922ge47d90234bk3ge))
	- The vast majority of excellent CEOs we spoke to found ways to include their employees when setting their vision, with similarly impressive results. Majid Al Futtaim‚Äôs Alain Bejjani says, ‚ÄúWe aimed to have the most inclusive process possible. Doing so built a broad sense of ownership, and we also found that some of the most insightful answers came from people we wouldn‚Äôt normally have approached for input, which in hindsight would have been a significant loss.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17zhwzrtyax63cgfmqfr7vr))
	- It was somewhat disconcerting to find that the best CEOs used the terms vision, mission, and company purpose as largely interchangeable. Communications and HR professionals, academics, and we as consultants can argue all we want about the nuances of each term, but the fact remains that the best CEOs don‚Äôt worry much about the distinctions‚Äîwhat matters for them is to have a clear and simply articulated North Star for the company that redefines success, influences decisions, and inspires people to act in desired ways. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17znrafj5jd198vcb3bsg66))
	- To achieve such impact, the best CEOs apply a mindset of boldness, resulting in a vision that looks beyond winning the game to reframing it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17zp2qk3s8f6s4sw6te98qe))
	- Once the vision is set, regardless of at what point in the journey, CEOs face another challenge: how to make that bold vision a reality. A Japanese proverb puts it starkly: ‚ÄúVision without action is merely a dream.‚Äù We now turn to what the best CEOs actually *do* to make dreams come true. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17zpdzw77xfvn167hwr5wb8))
	- CHAPTER 2 Strategy Practice Make Big Moves Early and Often ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17zptr47wpdffjtxxmt2cdq))
	- Kennedy‚Äôs story shows how a ‚Äúbe bold‚Äù mindset applies not just to vision but to the strategies employed in pursuit of it. A leader who sought to minimize uncertainty and guard against making mistakes would never have chosen as audacious a strategic move as a lunar landing; instead they would have simply increased funding for science and technology. Like Kennedy, the best CEOs boldly make big strategic moves early and often during their tenure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17zqyk6xdqafr2sn6qy7tc9))
		- **Note**: We also need to allow failure when asking ourselves to make big moves.
	- The research shows the following five strategic moves matter most, as long as they‚Äôre pursued with a ‚Äúman on the moon‚Äù kind of boldness:[18](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/56709668#ch00note-18)
	  
	  1.  **Buy and Sell.** The best CEOs execute at least one deal per year on average, and over a ten-year period these deals cumulatively amount to more than 30 percent of a company‚Äôs market cap (although typically no single deal amounts to more than 30 percent of the company‚Äôs value). This puts a premium on having a deep capability to identify, negotiate, and integrate acquisitions. The top CEOs are as bold about selling as they are about buying, which can also take the form of spinning off businesses. Aon is a poster child for making deals. In CEO Greg Case‚Äôs words, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always shaping and improving our portfolio. Over the last fifteen years, we‚Äôve done over 220 acquisitions and more than 150 divestitures, some big and others small. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17zw1t82vp248ma6ek0rpwf))
	- **Invest.** If you want your company‚Äôs investments to be big enough to move the needle, your capital expenditures to sales ratio needs to exceed 1.7 times the industry median for ten years. That‚Äôs a big number, but when capital is spent wisely it can enable a company to expand faster than its industry. General Motors‚Äô Mary Barra exemplified this strategic move when she committed more than half of GM‚Äôs product development capital ($27 billion through 2025) to pursue leadership in the global electric vehicle market. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17zwyzaa060cz7qk5wmxavy))
	- **Improve Productivity.** The most successful companies reduce administrative, sales, and labor costs more deeply than others, and in so doing achieve 25 percent more productivity improvement than their industry‚Äôs median over a ten-year period. This is exactly what Allianz‚Äôs Oliver B√§te did to help him pursue his renewal agenda, ‚ÄúSimplicity Wins.‚Äù In an industry that had seen flat expense ratios at 30 percent for decades, B√§te‚Äîsoon after he became CEO‚Äîdrove the company‚Äôs expense ratio below 28 percent while increasing customer loyalty from 50 percent in 2015 to 70 percent in 2019, and increasing internal growth rates from negative rates in 2015 to 6 percent in 2019 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h18018q1fjrmkccq8ge5b05j))
	- **Differentiate.** The best CEOs improve their business models and create pricing advantages in ways that are big enough to change a company‚Äôs trajectory. As a result, their companies achieve an average gross margin that exceeds the industry‚Äôs by 30 percent or more over a decade. Former LEGO CEO J√∏rgen Vig Knudstorp used this strategic move well in pursuing what he called, ‚Äúa strategy of niche differentiation and excellence‚Äù that aimed to refresh at least half the company‚Äôs core products every year. He created, for example, digital platforms that strengthened communication among LEGO fans, developed products for girls, licensed collections (e.g., Star Wars), and launched the successful LEGO movie franchise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1801gpss7w0z7kvwt5yvsnc))
	- **Allocate.** This move is deemed big when a company shifts more than 60 percent of its capital expenditures among business units over ten years. Doing so creates 50 percent more value than companies that reallocate more slowly. Resource reallocation involves more than just capital, however; it also means shifting operating expenditure, talent, and management attention to where it does the most good. As such, it‚Äôs a vital enabler of the other four big moves and given its importance it will be covered in the next chapter, and then again when we talk about talent, and further still when we talk about leading the top team and creating the right operating rhythm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1801q8zwaxxw79qcchq7dh8))
	- CEOs who make too few moonshot-size moves‚Äîor make them too late in their tenure‚Äîfall behind the pack ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1806khnfzx74s5tm3stk939))
	- Meanwhile, the research also shows that making two of these big moves more than doubles the likelihood of rising from the middle of the pack to the top, and executing three or more makes such a rise six times more likely. Furthermore, CEOs who make these moves earlier in their tenure outperform those who move later, and those who do so multiple times in their tenure avoid an otherwise common decline in performance over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h180792z1zp923f47akn79tw))
	- While the research is categorically clear on what separates the best from the rest, every CEO needs to determine which specific big strategic moves make sense for their company ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1807mk71337n5m480g0z36h))
	- Be bold and be right. If you‚Äôre not bold, you‚Äôre not going to do much of anything. If you‚Äôre not right, you‚Äôre not going to be here.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1807zxja2pj4eckj89m2dz0))
	- As Hastings experienced, making big moves in a fast-moving, uncertain environment with many variables that can‚Äôt be controlled is risky. The easier path is to shrink back and stay safe, yet the best CEOs show courage to act in the face of uncertainty. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h180c2yvp26b1wr70fykka9w))
	- board asked, ‚ÄòAre you sure?‚Äô My answer was, ‚ÄòOf course not, there‚Äôs no way to be sure.‚Äô We created a culture to be open about having insecurities, but also to have the guts and determination to go after the opportunities ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h180bjx4vvre7g3kvta7c7yh))
	- The best CEOs aren‚Äôt only willing to venture into uncharted waters‚Äîthey‚Äôre also willing to boldly stay the course on stormy seas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h180cavw1estxqr6b112b4bw))
	- Being terrified but going ahead and doing what needs to be done‚Äîthat‚Äôs courage. The one who feels no fear is a fool, and the one who lets fear rule him is a coward.‚Äù[19](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/56709668#ch00note-19) Medtronic‚Äôs George puts a fine point on the importance of this aspect of the role. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen some otherwise very well-qualified CEOs who lacked courage,‚Äù he observes, ‚Äúand their companies managed for a while but atrophied over time.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1824cpet1rhswyvwx2th3vp))
	- Be an Exceptional Futurist
	  
	  Virtually every CEO we spoke to emphasized the importance of having a clear point of view on where the world is going. They keep careful track of shifts in technology, changes in customer preferences, new competitors, and threats on the horizon. Doing so enables them to place bets before these trends become conventional wisdom and to maintain conviction when others inevitably criticize their choices to invest in markets that may not exist or technologies that are considered long shots.

	- It was the late 1990s, and the world was still largely analog at the time, but Breen foresaw a shift to digital. Digital set-top boxes didn‚Äôt exist and would be expensive to develop. Breen had conviction, however, and put 80 percent of the company‚Äôs R&D toward solving the problem. The investment paid off: GI was the first out of the gates with a digital box. Unfortunately, the technology was expensive to produce. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h18kx56se41d20zz6027kgpz))
	- Another instance of Breen‚Äôs anticipating future trends occurred later in his career while he was at DuPont. It was 2017, and he concluded that the agriculture industry was going to consolidate down to just a few players. Breen had studied the trends and economics of the industry, and realized that anyone who was fourth or fifth in this market would struggle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h18kwf986v71k5ppk886e6ds))
	- All of the excellent CEOs we spoke to had similarly lucid views as to what the future would bring. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h18m4tqdeh1zbv4dkxhneeqm))
	- ‚ÄúFive years ago people were saying, ‚ÄòOh, this will never work.‚Äô So it‚Äôs a lonely place. You‚Äôve got to be the one to take some risk, and that emanates from your world view. As a CEO, you have to have an absolute first-class view of where the world is going.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h18m68s2hzxgyqe6vb4x04zz))
	- ‚ÄúEarly in my career, I wondered how to develop a vision and a strategy,‚Äù DSM‚Äôs Sijbesma shares. ‚ÄúDo you sit in your study and yell, ‚ÄòEureka! I have it‚Äô? I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how it works. I started reading more about all kinds of subjects, including unrelated subjects, to combine the unrelated things into something new‚Äînot only in technical innovation but also in business. I also started traveling a lot and building a network, connecting with a lot of people in business, science, and society.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h18mh0g8mtjebj64q60w88d5))
	- For LEGO‚Äôs J√∏rgen Vig Knudstorp, an unlikely group of customers was instrumental: the adult fan community. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h18mhanbedk5zr1m3vh599fc))
	- Many CEOs beyond Breen and Baker spoke to us about how they practically managed the downside risks of big moves. ‚ÄúMost things that bring you down are the unintended consequences, that‚Äôs the way we avoided disaster,‚Äù shares the former CEO of automotive parts maker Delphi, Rod O‚ÄôNeal. ‚ÄúOne cause of our success was the things we didn‚Äôt do. We didn‚Äôt go big in India or South America or Russia. We avoided all the pitfalls of what a lot of companies were trying to do.‚Äù O‚ÄôNeal avoided the pitfalls through a process of methodically working through potential unintended consequences. ‚ÄúIf you make a given decision, you can‚Äôt just consider the first domino you trip, which is probably a good outcome,‚Äù he shares. ‚ÄúWhat could be the second-, third-, fourth-, fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-order consequences? We would go down the decision tree and see what outcomes could occur as things played out. If we came across one that, no matter how remote it was, we couldn‚Äôt survive it if it showed up, we made another decision. We didn‚Äôt play the game of saying, ‚ÄòOh, man, that‚Äôll be a disaster if it shows up, but it probably won‚Äôt, so let‚Äôs try it anyway.‚Äô‚Ää‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1ah4dae4sx7y42vk1865dn4))
	- he best CEOs hardwire their view of the future into their company‚Äôs strategic planning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h18mhs526pnqax31vzr4cft7))
	- Over time, the best CEOs avoid the downside by forming some rules of thumb based on pattern recognition. At Danaher, Larry Culp, who was the company‚Äôs CEO from 2001 through 2014 and who went on to become the chairman and CEO of GE, applied three hurdles for making an acquisition. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to like the space and the company,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to be able to add value. And the math of the deal has to work. But we have to come at it in that sequence, because if you flip it the way most bankers want you to, you‚Äôre going to get in trouble. We were quite candid with ourselves as to where we could add value and if we were the best owner. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1ah5h4ancx51eb30a0enbn4))
	- Keep an Eye on the Downside
	  
	  To be clear, boldness doesn‚Äôt mean recklessness. Excellent CEOs fully understand the risk/reward trade-offs of potential big moves. Explains Dupont‚Äôs Ed Breen, ‚ÄúOne thing I always study the most is the downside scenario. If I don‚Äôt get this perfectly the way I think it‚Äôs going to go, what is my downside scenario? And can I live with it? I always feel angst over that more than anything. I would never make a decision where I was risking too much. But if I can live with the downside scenario and I still end up being better off, that‚Äôs a good risk/reward.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1a0a1qsvmvr7cjh00man560))
	- Ecolab‚Äôs former CEO Doug Baker agrees that taking risks only makes sense when the trade-offs are understood. ‚ÄúMost of the time, you‚Äôre making strategic decisions with imperfect information,‚Äù says Baker, who became head of the water and hygiene services giant in 2004. ‚ÄúIf you wait until you have everything you want to know, then you‚Äôre likely to miss the opportunity. More often than not, you have to make calls with incomplete information. I often ask, ‚ÄòWhich mistake can you more afford to make?‚Äô‚Ää‚Äù Baker, for example, is willing to build, say, a $75 million new plant in China to manufacture water treatment solutions, and risk that the market may disappear because, if it does, it won‚Äôt kill the enterprise. When big moves are made through this filter, ‚ÄúThe worst mistake I can make,‚Äù says Baker, ‚Äúis to throttle back‚Äîit‚Äôs essential to keep growing, keep investing, keep moving, but to do so in a way that increases the company‚Äôs odds of success.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1a0atpweyxcksh95w3bq4js))
	- To help analyze risks, the best CEOs apply the right analytics. Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen shares what happened behind the scenes during the company‚Äôs big move to migrate all of its customers to the cloud. ‚ÄúWe intuitively knew migrating our products to subscription was the right vision. To test this conviction, we literally covered the boardroom with pricing and unit models, predictions for how quickly perpetual licenses would fall off, and how quickly online subscriptions would ramp up. We spent hours knee-deep in modeling output.‚Äù Doing so increased the entire team‚Äôs commitment. ‚ÄúIt really takes guts, but through this discussion we saw that we could manage through it and that Adobe, our customers, and our shareholders would benefit in the long run.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1a2nqv40kjs9fv122q5yw98))

	  Set√∫bal‚Äôs experience illustrates how many of the best CEOs think of making big moves: as a series of ‚ÄúS-curves‚Äù driving change over time. This means they ramp up into a period of intensive activity and radical improvement through a set of big moves, followed by a period of restoration while still improving incrementally, followed by another ramp-up in big-move intensity, and so on. Excellent CEOs are always looking to the next S-curve while ensuring the current one is delivered on. Microsoft‚Äôs Satya Nadella describes the tension: ‚ÄúThere are some things where you have to be long-term and patient. Some things where you have to be impatient. That‚Äôs a fascinating thing‚Äîwhat is tempo? You‚Äôve got to balance the future and the present. Only the CEO can do that.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1ah7e2qdwjckws12ppqmvq2))

	- We‚Äôre often called on to counsel CEOs who start strong by making a series of bold moves but a few years into their tenure experience waning motivation and increasingly static performance. These CEOs got the memo on ‚Äúmake big moves early‚Äù but not the one that added, ‚Äúand often.‚Äù Every big move should have a start and a finish, with the completion of each phase building confidence and creating capacity for further change. When the equivalent of a lunar landing is achieved, victory should be celebrated and lessons should be learned, but then it‚Äôs time for the next bold move to take the company even further, faster. Doing so accounts for why, as we described in the introduction, the best CEOs achieve above-market performance on a sustained basis, avoiding the slumps that the less skilled experience as they go ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1ah9bqwfhpm1m913tvtdwke))

	- While there‚Äôs no guarantee of success, the fact remains that without making big moves early and often, there‚Äôs little chance for a company to become a top performer. We mentioned earlier that one of the five big moves correlated with success‚Äîresource allocation‚Äîis essential in enabling other big strategic moves. Having covered the topics of vision and strategy, we now shift our focus fully to resource allocation‚Äîthe final vital practice in setting a company on the right path. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1ahjqmpam0451t6tmp8kfqg))
	- the best CEOs think hard about what tempo to set for the big changes they‚Äôre making. Doing this isn‚Äôt easy but it‚Äôs necessary. Says McKinsey & Company‚Äôs Dominic Barton, himself an expert in advising companies on transformational change: ‚ÄúNo one likes change, so you need to create a rhythm of change. Think of it as applying ‚Äòheart paddles‚Äô to the organization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1a3t2ysx2510s8p0dx5bbvk))
	- When allocation decisions don‚Äôt line up with the company‚Äôs vision and strategy, the latter become just hollow words in corporate presentations that quickly lose credibility and potency. Further, if a CEO cannot allocate capital more effectively than capital markets, the business will lose its legitimacy in the eyes of its shareholders and might even trigger an activist investor campaign to break up the company. Add to this the ‚Äútragedy of the commons‚Äù problem‚Äîthe notion that individuals will neglect the good of the whole if they‚Äôre focused on self-gain‚Äîand it‚Äôs easy to see why the best CEOs are front and center in allocating resources ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1ahrtkqkc4yvfjp4x7qqs80))
	- Thinking like an outsider when it comes to reallocation means a CEO isn‚Äôt wed to tradition, encumbered by internal loyalties, or willing to bow to short-term pressures. Instead, they regularly ask themselves what a new CEO with no emotional ties or history would do if brought in to take over the company. Practically speaking, this translates to allocating resources by‚Ä¶

	- The regional president argued: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been here forever. We can‚Äôt leave the market.

		- **Note**: Don‚Äôt act on directives without a strategy.
	- During her tenure, Barra has continued to take a zero-based approach to capital allocation. In market after market she carefully analyzes where GM has the best chances of winning and generating an appropriate return. When doing her strategic reviews she engages in deep analysis and has tough conversations with her executives along the lines of: ‚ÄúIs there a different business model we can use? Can we source product from somewhere else? Or do we need to exit the market?‚Äù When she meets resistance from one of her executives, she asks: ‚ÄúWould you put your own dollar into it? If you wouldn‚Äôt put your own money into something, why should we?‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1as172fthfyryanrgp7st6r))
	- Barra‚Äôs approach of questioning everything and ensuring that every major investment reflects her company‚Äôs vision, strategy, and financial goals was echoed by virtually every excellent CEO to whom we spoke. For example, Medtronic‚Äôs Bill George talked about the importance of ‚Äúthe ability to see things through a fresh set of eyes‚Äù and LEGO‚Äôs J√∏rgen Vig Knudstorp shared, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never going to have a chance unless you radically reallocate resources, so with that we started producing a product portfolio every year that was fifty to seventy percent new.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1as1kvgkatdz082qwce32yw))
	- Beyond taking a zero-based approach for each potential investment, the best CEOs use a mantra of ‚Äúsolving for the whole‚Äù that helps them cut through to the right answer quickly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1axqpqb7r60tje382gkdp30))
		- **Note**: Allocate funds to the projects that give the most return.
	- Allianz‚Äôs Oliver B√§te explains the resistance he experienced when centralizing some functions, as well as the analogies he used to help cut through the office politics: ‚ÄúWe grow up with all these kingdoms, that produce their own grain, have their own cows, have their own machinery, build their own highways, and so on. So the leaders of your businesses say, ‚ÄòIf you take all these resources away from me, I don‚Äôt rule a kingdom anymore. I‚Äôm not going to be anything more than a sales outlet.‚Äô
	  
	  ‚ÄúThat is totally the wrong analogy,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúThe better way to think about it is like the Mercedes-Benz team in Formula 1. You have two champions. You have Lewis Hamilton, who is a world champion race car driver, which is the heads of the business units. And you have the makers of the car, which is Mercedes, that‚Äôs the role of the central functions. Lewis Hamilton doesn‚Äôt design tires, steering wheels, the chassis, or the engine. But he still has to drive in Shanghai, Monte Carlo, and so on. And he has to finish the race first. That‚Äôs the power of solving for Allianz as a whole,‚Äù says B√§te. ‚ÄúYou [the business head] tell us what car you need to win the race, and we [the center] will bring it to you, built on a world-class platform.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1axwf8jmvh1akwzzgam7byf))
	- Manage by Milestones (Not Annual Budgets)
	  
	  ‚ÄúI get so frustrated,‚Äù confesses Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPMC), ‚Äúwith business leaders who say they didn‚Äôt make an investment because it wasn‚Äôt in their budget. You have to say, ‚ÄòI want to do X. I want to add branches, I want to go to the cloud. I need to be competitive.‚Äô You want to spend $500 million? Recommend it. Show me why. I may ask a million questions before the ultimate decision, but if it‚Äôs a good idea, we‚Äôll do it. We can change what is planned in the budget.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1ayd2t3fg2e7y05fy8t5evk))
	- They release additional tranches of investment only when there is strong evidence that previous tranches are yielding results. Each milestone forces periodic debate over whether to continue or not. Dupont CEO Ed Breen describes how it works at his company: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got metrics around every big program. We ask the question of where we are on cost. We regularly ask whether we still think we‚Äôre getting the right return on the program. This way we can track every program and see how it‚Äôs doing, and we always do a postmortem one year after the project is completed.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1ayx1gvme4sg4sy4j9h14qj))
	- Closely monitoring investments on a milestone-driven basis, however, doesn‚Äôt mean that budgets should be constantly moved around. As long as the big moves still make sense, the milestones are being met, and the actions taken are delivering results for the company, the best CEOs stay the course.

	- Our research found that there‚Äôs little overall difference between the seeding and harvesting behavior of the best CEOs and the rest. This isn‚Äôt surprising: Seeding involves giving money to new business opportunities‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs rarely resisted. And while harvesting is difficult, it most often occurs as a result of a business unit‚Äôs sustained underperformance, which is difficult to ignore. We found, however, that the best nurtured and pruned their business nearly three times more often than the rest. Together, these two functions represent half of all corporate reallocation activity in the best companies.[23](#ch00note-23) Both tasks are difficult because they often involve taking resources from one business unit and giving them to another. What‚Äôs more, the better a company is at encouraging seeding, the more important these two activities become‚Äînurturing to ensure the success of new initiatives and pruning to eliminate branches that won‚Äôt ever bear fruit.

	- At Alphabet, Sundar Pichai regularly reflects on advice from his mentor Bill Campbell, a three-time CEO‚Äîat Claris, Intuit, and GO Corporation‚Äîand influential coach to several technology industry leaders. ‚ÄúBill used to ask me every Monday, ‚ÄòWhat ties did you break last week?‚Äô Organizations can be stuck if you don‚Äôt break ties. For example, we had Play Music and YouTube Music‚Äîsimilar music products. At some point, somebody has to make a decision; it unlocks so many resources.

	- One such funeral turned out to be a rebirth. A multiyear R&D project for the company‚Äôs picture frame glass business had flopped. Engineers had created a glass coating that took all the photons from incoming light and pushed them directly through the glass onto the painting or photograph, making the glass fully transparent with absolutely no reflection. Unfortunately, the technology was prohibitively expensive, and the only market for this glass was museums, which was too small for DSM‚Äôs purposes.
	  
	  As the project eulogy was being given, one of the technicians from a different unit raised his hand, intrigued by the technology he was hearing about for the first time. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm understanding the chemistry behind the coating, what would happen if you applied it to solar panels? Wouldn‚Äôt this give them more photons to absorb than otherwise and therefore increase efficiency?‚Äù Sijbesma turned to his chief innovation officer and both looked incredulously at each other: serendipity. It was a simple yet brilliant idea that hadn‚Äôt been considered by the sales department, which had fixated on the picture frame market.

	- We didn‚Äôt find a single excellent CEO who felt they‚Äôd somehow been too active in reallocating resources. Majid Al Futtaim‚Äôs Alain Bejjani sums up why: ‚ÄúResource reallocation is easier said than done because many organizations are anchored in existing commitments, expectations, and realities that are often outside their control.‚Äù Boldness is required to break through, which involves acting like an outsider‚Äîfree of political and historical shackles.

	- The best resource allocators justify every investment from scratch by starting with a zero base. They make it clear that the good of the whole company will be put ahead of any one area. They manage less by annual budgets and more by performance milestones, making resource allocation a continuous (not cyclical) process. Lastly, they kill off as much as they start through thoughtful pruning and harvesting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1b05h92ygrf4nqbqgndz1px))

	- Once a CEO sets a direction for the company‚Äôs future, the probability that the plan will become reality is low. Many studies, including our own research, conclude that only one in three strategies is successfully implemented. The reasons for failure are rooted in the reality that change is rarely an intellectual problem, it‚Äôs an emotional one. The ‚Äúsoft stuff‚Äù‚Äîissues related to people and culture‚Äîaccount for the vast majority (72 percent) of the barriers to success.[24](#ch00note-24) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1b0kkt1ss8j5dcmpbgd8f9p))
	- The best CEOs *don‚Äôt* follow this pattern. They don‚Äôt just acknowledge that the soft stuff is hard, they vow to treat the soft stuff as the hard stuff. And they make sure that every senior leader, not just the CHRO, owns the people-related implications of the strategy. KBC‚Äôs Johan Thijs puts it thusly: ‚ÄúYou have to fix both sides as the CEO: The easy part is technical; the difficult part is people. You might fix the technical issues: finding capital, liquidity, profitability, and so forth. But over time if you can‚Äôt solve the mindset issues, you‚Äôll go back on the same route because the mindset is going to drive you again over a cliff.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1b0mh5m4vmbae1fkgh8ewd6))
	- The impact of choosing a ‚Äútreat the soft stuff as the hard stuff‚Äù mindset and taking the actions it calls for is dramatic: The odds of a strategy being successfully executed more than double from 30 to 79 percent, and the impact of that execution is 1.8 times greater.[25](#ch00note-25) These differences in performance are driven by the best CEOs taking radically different approaches with respect to each of the three sub-elements involved in aligning an organization: culture, organizational design, and talent.

	- It does require putting rigor and discipline into the process, however. Satya Nadella‚Äôs approach at Microsoft is archetypal. He began by commissioning a small cross-functional team to conduct a deep diagnostic, speaking to experts, senior leaders, VPs, and numerous focus groups to learn about their experience, the culture they desired, what they were passionate about preserving from their history, and what needed to be left behind. With this broad input, a ‚Äúculture cabinet‚Äù made up of seventeen leaders from across Microsoft, chaired by Nadella himself, worked to boil the input down to a vital few themes. In the end, Nadella decided to adopt a ‚Äúgrowth mindset,‚Äù inspired by the research of Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, who emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and from others versus trying to prove oneself correct over and over. The company‚Äôs history of taking on bold technological challenges and giving back to the world would be retained, but the highly individualistic and internally competitive culture that feared failure and struggled to collaborate were attributes that would be shed.

	- So what shapes an employee‚Äôs work environment? There are four primary influencers. It‚Äôs the stories that are told and the questions that are asked. It‚Äôs the formal mechanisms that govern how work gets done (structure, processes, systems, incentives). It‚Äôs the role modeling employees observe (from the CEO, senior team, and others they consider influential). Finally, it‚Äôs the extent to which people have confidence in their ability to behave in desired ways.

	  In a helix organization, it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúdual hard line‚Äù or a ‚Äúdotted line‚Äù reporting structure. Rather, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsplit hard line‚Äù where an employee reports to two different leaders for two different purposes (thus the two intertwined strands). The split hard line construct doesn‚Äôt apply to every job in an organization, but for roles in complex matrices where sales channel, product, and functional expertise need to come together on behalf of the customer, a helix approach provides an elegant and pragmatic solution ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1jkykvyrn3ke09fcp7bhdhs))
	- At JPMC, Jamie Dimon explains how a helix approach works when it comes to the way corporate staff engage with business units. ‚ÄúI have my management team at the corporate level‚Äîmy head of HR, my CFO, my general counsel, etc. We set policy for HR, for accounting, for risk, and so on, but other than that, execution is 100 percent the line of business‚Äôs responsibility. Then from a governance standpoint the corporate team can step into any one of our units and say, ‚Äòyou can‚Äôt do this‚Äô or ‚Äòyou can‚Äôt do that,‚Äô but they have to come as a partner. The goal is to do the right thing for the company. As a result they‚Äôre welcomed as partners by the business leaders.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1jm7atdamzaxyxhwrsakmat))

	- At Intuit, Brad Smith describes some of the stable elements of his organization: ‚ÄúWe organize first around the customer, and then underneath that, the specific problems for the customer. In practice, that means we have a consumer group and small business group at the top, and underneath that a payments group, for example. That does not change. Then we decide on how to best build the connective tissue as we drive things at scale as a platform company. For example, we have a centralized small business design team that works across that customer‚Äôs problems.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1jn7swsgyre80mx1aph9sxp))

	- Another method to increase agility at Intuit was giving all employees 10 percent unstructured time. As Smith puts it, ‚ÄúWe had more than 1,800 different experiments going on at any one time. If you had an experiment that proved successful in the eyes of our customers, we would fund your idea for another three months.‚Äù The result? As Smith shares, ‚ÄúIt really helped us bring down the barriers of organization design, because everyone felt empowered to push their ideas out.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1jnk089kxkjyfjtqr2tjxkr))
	- Alphabet‚Äôs Sundar Pichai sets up ‚Äúfocus areas‚Äù when something important needs to be done outside the traditional product areas such as YouTube, Android, Search, and so on. Each focus area has a team and leader assigned and is empowered with tools to allow them to bypass certain approvals and move faster than the normal organizational processes would allow. ‚ÄúSometimes you need to design sanctioned ways by which people can break the structures you‚Äôve set up,‚Äù says Pichai.

	- There is a blue pill when it comes to organization design. American writer Charlton Ogburn Jr. described it well: ‚ÄúWe tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing; and what a wonderful method for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency, and demoralization.‚Äù The facts suggest that there are many leaders who choose this path. A full 70 percent of executives report they‚Äôve undergone a significant reorganization in the past two years, and the vast majority believe they‚Äôll experience another in the next two. Meanwhile, only 23 percent of organization redesigns are reported to have met their objectives and improved performance. Most others are never completed or simply don‚Äôt meet their objectives, and 10 percent actually have a significant *negative* impact on performance.[32](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/56709668#ch00note-32) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1jnsjh8rgte9m1jawwtdt68))
	- The best CEOs take the red pill. It enables them to resist the temptation to swing the pendulum back and forth between centralization and decentralization. It causes them to solve for clear accountability even in complex organization structures, rising above the matrix to reconfigure it as a helix. It prompts them to make smart choices about what the stabile and agile elements of the organization‚Äôs design are. Although it‚Äôs a more difficult path, taking the red pill as we‚Äôve described it increases the odds from 25 to 86 percent of your organization redesign being a success, and very likely it will make your employees feel like they‚Äôve been freed from a prison.[33](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/56709668#ch00note-33) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1jnt6vgvet60fa0btn730w7))

	- contrary to conventional wisdom‚Äîhierarchy and the roles that create the most value don‚Äôt always have that much in common. Of the fifty most valuable roles in a typical corporation, we found that only 10 percent are positions that report directly to a CEO; 60 percent exist at the next level down; and 20 percent are at the level below that.[35](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/56709668#ch00note-35) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1jpbsx54d0v3qv6984k1t29))
	- As the KBC example shows, by carefully specifying which roles create the most value and what‚Äôs required to succeed in them, getting the right people into place becomes far easier. Westpac‚Äôs Gail Kelly explains what can happen otherwise: ‚ÄúCompetent executives get moved into roles for which they‚Äôre not suited and which they don‚Äôt enjoy.

	- The most valuable person on a football team after the quarterback is the left tackle (or if the quarterback is left-handed, the right tackle), a player who doesn‚Äôt touch the ball at all. Why? Because they protect the quarterback from getting sacked or even injured by the other team‚Äôs pass rushers whom he can‚Äôt see because they‚Äôre coming at him on his blind side.[36](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/56709668#ch00note-36) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1jpxrnyxra7gj29kt3xb7wf))
	- The best CEOs dig deeper and ensure enough rigor and discipline is applied to finding the ‚Äúleft tackle‚Äù positions that protect and enable value to be created. In Trakulhoon‚Äôs case, his strategy was to move from commodity to higher value-added products, and that meant roles that had been overlooked by the previous regime became important. The research function was elevated, and its leader was recognized as a ‚Äúleft tackle‚Äù‚Äîone of the most important people on the team, even though by traditional measures that role had been considered less crucial. Focusing on the R&D role and ensuring it was filled with the best talent enabled Trakulhoon to grow the percent of sales from value-added products from 4 to 35 percent during his tenure.

	- The benefits of putting rigor and discipline into talent management are many, and account for why our discussions with the best CEOs were *not* characterized by what otherwise is often cited as a CEO‚Äôs biggest regret: moving too slowly on low performers in key roles, even when it was clear a change was needed.

		- **Note**: This can be applied to important decision making where the problem space, the goals, and how to get there must be clearly defined.
	- JPMC‚Äôs Jamie Dimon puts a fine point on the issue: ‚ÄúWhen someone asks me how I can demote a wonderful person, a loyal, ‚Äòpillar of society‚Äô out of a role where they aren‚Äôt the best fit, the answer is simple. They‚Äôre no longer doing a good job. If we were ‚Äòloyal‚Äô to them by leaving them in the job, we‚Äôd be hugely disloyal to everyone else and to the company‚Äôs clients. That, right there, is the hardest part about talent management.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1jqw5zrnhrc68szkfgwggxm))
	- The best CEOs recognize this challenge and acknowledge that it‚Äôs their leadership that will determine whether their team‚Äôs work will live up to its potential and propel the company forward. When thinking about how to get the most out of their leaders, many CEOs start with questions such as, ‚ÄúHow often should we meet?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat should be on the agenda?‚Äù The best, however, think less about what the team does together, and more about how the team works together.

	- One aptitude virtually all of the best CEOs look for is the ability to balance the short and long term. GM‚Äôs Mary Barra explains, ‚ÄúAt first, I thought, ‚ÄòJust let that person go sell, sell, sell, sell. And that‚Äôs fine.‚Äô Up to a certain level, that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that for the most senior positions, you have to have a person who can execute and drive the results today, but they also have to be looking over the horizon and planning for the future.

	- While all the best CEOs valued team members who could manage both the short and long term and who were willing to push back, some had specific attitudes they valued most. Dupont‚Äôs Ed Breen explains, ‚ÄúFor me, the number one thing is passion. Passionate people are infectious in a good way, and people want to be around them. Anyone whose r√©sum√© gets to me already has a great education and a great background. I don‚Äôt have to worry about all that.‚Äù Cadence Design System‚Äôs Lip-Bu Tan looked for ‚Äútransparency, humility, and a learning attitude.‚Äù For Esquel‚Äôs Marjorie Yang, ‚ÄúWhen picking leaders, I look for good quantitative reasoning skills, curiosity, and high emotional intelligence.‚Äù As it relates to emotional intelligence, Alphabet‚Äôs Sundar Pichai has grown to value empathy. ‚ÄúEight years ago, I would not have listed it as a top attribute. But to run an organization today at the scale of Google‚Äîwith its internal and external engagement demands‚Äîrequires high levels of interpersonal sophistication.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1jvrmyb0fc5w4dcvyhjk96z))
	- ‚ÄúConventional CEO wisdom states that you should move faster on people,‚Äù Majid Al Futtaim‚Äôs Alain Bejjani says. ‚ÄúBut I think that‚Äôs a very shortsighted and stubborn view. It‚Äôs true that you can‚Äôt make people change‚ÄîI can barely change my children, let alone members of my team. But you can create an environment that supports people in learning, adapting, and evolving to the extent that they can or want to do so.‚Äù Intuit‚Äôs Brad Smith illustrates the point with a sporting analogy: ‚ÄúAny coach who needs to replace all the players isn‚Äôt as good a coach as they think they are.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1jwwjx8v0de8pvkrptjxx4t))
	- Before removing someone from the team, the best CEOs make sure that the following questions can be answered in the affirmative:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   Does the team member know exactly what‚Äôs expected of them: i.e., what the agenda is and what jobs need to be done to drive that agenda?
	  ‚Ä¢   Have they been given the needed tools and resources, and a chance to build the necessary skills and confidence to use them effectively?
	  ‚Ä¢   Are they surrounded by others (including the CEO) who are aligned on a common direction and who display the desired mindsets and behaviors?

	- Connecting one-on-one doesn‚Äôt mean making team members feel like family, however. Cincinnati Children‚Äôs Michael Fisher explains the ‚Äúdistance‚Äù aspect of a constructive CEO-subordinate relationship. ‚ÄúYou also must recognize that you are their boss. While there‚Äôs a level of collegiality and familiarity, at the end of the day, your first responsibility is to the institution and making a functional top team.‚Äù DBS‚Äôs Piyush Gupta agrees: ‚ÄúIf you get too close to everybody, then you wind up not making tough choices and compromising for mediocrity. People need to respect that, finally, you are the boss.‚Äù Adidas‚Äôs Kasper R√∏rsted takes a very black-and-white stance on the issue so as to be able to cleanly enforce needed accountability: ‚ÄúAt work, I want to be friendly, but I don‚Äôt want to make friends.

There are good mistakes: You argued for it, you thought it through, you talked to the right people, and you were wrong. So you have to allow failure. We don‚Äôt just look at the profit-and-loss statement. Instead we ask, did you work hard? Did you hire people? Did you train people? Did you do the right thing for the client? Did you help other people? Did you build systems? When we asked you to do something like recruiting, did you help us?‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1r0emvgdgk0e3ab2gg9pd9e))

Thermo Fisher Scientific CEO Marc Casper shares his philosophy: ‚ÄúOne of the reasons for our success is the ‚Äòruthless prioritization‚Äô of what we work on together.

For example, quarterly business performance reviews are done with a subset of corporate leaders (e.g., CEO, CFO, and CHRO) and individual businesses, unless there is a cultural reason to combine the reviews into one session. Corporate governance and policy decisions (e.g., risk management controls and processes) are typically taken by a subset of leaders, and those decisions are then shared broadly so that the team can execute against them.

	  Once there‚Äôs clarity on what topics team time will be spent on, the next step is to gain the same degree of clarity on how those topics will be tackled, which starts by establishing the mindset that the top team is every member‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst team.‚Äù The best CEOs are unequivocal on this issue. This means that everyone is expected to put the company‚Äôs needs ahead of those of the business unit‚Äôs or function‚Äôs.

	- Brad Smith describes a method he used to ensure decisions were data-driven at Intuit: ‚ÄúOur decision-making principles insist on evidence. One of the mottos at Intuit is, ‚ÄòBecause of (blank), I believe we should do (blank).‚Äô If it‚Äôs not based in evidence, it‚Äôs an opinion, and we discount it.

	- Dialogue only works, however, if the team members are free of bias. The most common bias is groupthink: our tendency to back an idea based on how favorably we believe others will view that decision. Another is the confirmation bias, where one accepts information that confirms one‚Äôs beliefs and resists any information to the contrary. A third prevalent bias is the optimism bias: the assumption and expectation that the best possible outcome will emerge. The best CEOs proactively mitigate the impact of such biases.

As Smith shares, ‚ÄúThe approver is responsible for articulating up front the principles they‚Äôre using to make the decision. For example, this is going to be a cost decision, or a quality decision. The approver also picks the date the decision would be made, even if all the data is not available.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h228h6htqex3yn30pazc8yw9))
	- Discipline is a must to get the most out of team meetings. At DBS, Piyush Gupta created a mechanism called MOJO to ensure meetings were productive. The ‚ÄúMO‚Äù stands for the Meeting Owner who makes sure the objectives of the meeting are clear, the right attendees and information are present, and that the discussion is well organized and led. The ‚ÄúJO‚Äù is the Joyful Observer, whose role is to critique the meeting. According to Gupta, ‚Äúthe fact you have someone sitting there empowered to say, ‚ÄòHey, this is how the meeting is going, this worked, this didn‚Äôt work, this isn‚Äôt getting to the point‚Äô made a massive difference.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h26mw15t26fjardjkdvw3y7t))
		- **Note**: How can we implement the joyful observer role in meetings at OBI?
	- DBS also created a simple tool to enable every meeting to be evaluated afterward by the participants, the results of which are shared with the meeting owner, a technique common in organizations led by the best CEOs. Brad Smith describes the mechanism used at Intuit to guarantee time was being well spent: ‚ÄúWe had participants indicate on a zero-to-ten scale whether they‚Äôd recommend a meeting to a colleague. Was it valuable? After diagnosing the low-scoring ones, we sometimes fixed them but mostly decided that they weren‚Äôt necessary.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h26mzx3ymz646758ww6332cv))

	- results are remarkably consistent and reveal three key dimensions of great teamwork. The first is alignment on direction‚Äîa shared belief about what the company is striving toward and the role of the team in getting there. The second is high-quality interaction, characterized by trust, open communication, and a willingness to embrace conflict. The third is a strong sense of renewal, meaning an environment in which team members become energized because they feel they can take risks, innovate, learn from outside ideas, and achieve something that matters‚Äîoften against the odds. Research shows that for every 20 percent improvement on these dimensions, team productivity on average doubles. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h26ps7nnd799fmgvyr6s7g5b))

	- Westpac‚Äôs Gail Kelly describes her overall takeaway with respect to setting a tempo: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very important early on for a new CEO to dive into getting various pieces of the organization to sync. Don‚Äôt just leave it to chance.‚Äù It sounds sensible, but should a CEO really play a hands-on role in determining the weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual meetings with individuals, committees, the team as a whole, and the top two hundred? Kelly‚Äôs view is strongly affirmative. ‚ÄúYou have to get into that level of detail, you can‚Äôt just hope it happens‚Äîit won‚Äôt,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou have to ensure the charters are right for each forum and be clear where the decision-making lies. The effectiveness of the strategy depends on these things being clear and aligned.‚Äù Ita√∫ Unibanco‚Äôs Roberto Set√∫bal adds that doing so isn‚Äôt a one-time event early in a CEO‚Äôs tenure. ‚ÄúAs we grew, I started creating more processes to better organize the way decisions were made so that actions were driven in a way that felt natural,‚Äù he shares. ‚ÄúImportantly, all this process must evolve with the times.‚Äù Said another way, it‚Äôs important to not let a groove become a rut.

	- Ahold Delhaize‚Äôs Dick Boer reinforces the point: ‚ÄúI quickly realized during my tenure that we didn‚Äôt have the granularity of information we needed for decision\-making. There was a lot of information in the business, but we were seeing only aggregated numbers.‚Äù Boer and his team came to the conclusion that, ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt have the right data, we‚Äôll never have the opportunity to tackle the real performance issues.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32pphvj97cbpa7d8m9zzmm1))
		- **Note**: Ensure data driven decisions. Question decisions if you you don't see the data driving it.
	- The best CEOs ensure that granular data is comparable across the organization‚Äôs various units. As Caterpillar‚Äôs Jim Owens relates: ‚ÄúWe had a lot of cowboy types in our leadership at the plants. Each plant did things a little differently, and manufacturing had an engrained culture. So, we challenged the traditional way of thinking by introducing a global, Toyota\-type production system with common metrics, process tools, and management systems. We customized it as the Caterpillar Production System. Under our new protocol, everyone needed to complete, measure, and report tasks in a specific way.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32pspvn4fxs5jxckz0esgzg))
	- Beyond ensuring the right information is available, the best CEOs also demand discipline in how meetings are conducted. JPMC‚Äôs Jamie Dimon explains, ‚ÄúVery rarely do I allow a presentation. It‚Äôs all pre\-reads and recommendations. We prepare in advance so that we‚Äôre using meeting time to make decisions.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32pv5ey66r610hwc9scqpts))
	- Discipline also applies to the CEO themselves. As Dimon explains, ‚ÄúI always read the reports, so I‚Äôm completely engaged. I read a tremendous amount over the weekends and I make a list of questions. ‚ÄòWhy are we losing money in a certain area? How come we spoke about adding 500 bankers and we‚Äôve only added 100? Why is our attrition fifteen percent and not eight percent? I‚Äôm usually a little frustrated‚Äîwhy didn‚Äôt someone ask this question before I did?‚Äù To mitigate the risk that his questions create a flurry of unhelpful analysis after a meeting, Dimon adds, ‚ÄúI tell everyone they‚Äôre not allowed to do an exercise just for me. They should do this analysis to run their business. If you think my question is a complete waste of time, you are required to tell me that, too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32pzb7c9txk1r148faffq3v))
	- Going deep into troubled areas is yet another example of the discipline the best CEOs have. Galderma‚Äôs Flemming √òrnskov drives home the point as it relates to a company‚Äôs operating rhythm: ‚ÄúI really prepare for meetings, and make sure the agenda is tight and focused. I read the pre\-reads, I think about it, I start and finish meetings on time. All meetings start and end with a recap of action items and follow\-ups. And I think that discipline is something people observe. I also have the discipline to say no to a lot of things that shareholders aren‚Äôt paying me to do; I don‚Äôt run to meetings, internal or external, that are irrelevant. I don‚Äôt measure success by the number of keynote speeches made at industry gatherings.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32qb4569y7pg9ks5x102q9v))
	- Getting it right isn‚Äôt easy, however, as JPMC‚Äôs Jamie Dimon reinforces: ‚ÄúMost companies don‚Äôt execute well. This is about execution and getting disciplined, like it‚Äôs exercise.

	- ven if you‚Äôre not a CEO, solving for the psychology of your team is a clear pathway to great performance. Ask yourself: Does every one of my team members have the right aptitude and attitude? If not, are you courageously acting fast but fair to remediate the situation? If an outsider came in, would they keep this team‚Äîand if not, does it mean you‚Äôve grown too close? Does the team do only the work that it can do when it meets, or is team time spent on low\-priority things that could be done outside the room? Is your team the ‚Äúfirst team‚Äù for all who are on it? (And if not, why not?) Are discussions characterized by both data and dialogue, and do decisions get made in a timely manner? Are you investing methodically in team building? Have you created an efficient and effective annual operating rhythm of meetings? Do you connect dots for people, orchestrate the right interactions, and roll up your sleeves as needed to ensure progress is being made in priority areas?

	- On March 4, 1933, the US economy had, for all intents and purposes, shut down. Thousands of the nation‚Äôs banks were closed after repeated panics. Roughly a quarter of the labor force was out of work. On this day Franklin D. Roosevelt made his first inaugural address to the American people. ‚ÄúThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself,‚Äù he famously asserted. One speech, however, wasn‚Äôt enough to convince the populace that they should be confident in him or his plans. Roosevelt subsequently invented his fireside radio chats. On March 12, he opened his first chat with, ‚ÄúMy friends, I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United States about banking‚Ä¶‚Äù He was ruthlessly honest in his outlook, sharing openly, ‚ÄúOnly a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.‚Äù
	  
	  The candor of Roosevelt‚Äôs fireside chats played an important role in building trust between the governed and their governors, which gave him the flexibility to try different remedies for the Great Depression‚Äîwith the understanding that many might fail.

	- The best CEOs create the same virtuous cycle that Banga created: By building trust early he had the flexibility to make bold moves that improved performance, which, in turn, deepened trust.

	- Choose Radical Transparency
	  
	  Given that boards only meet periodically, it‚Äôs tempting for CEOs to work around them or keep things ‚Äúunder the radar‚Äù when it comes to handling tough issues. A CEO might get wind of a key executive who has pushed the edge of ethical boundaries. That executive might be someone who is hard to replace quickly, and ideally the company would like to remediate the situation and retain the person. The facts might be fuzzy and open to interpretation. So why tell the board? One might imagine similarly complex scenarios involving mergers and acquisitions, regulatory compliance issues, customer complaints, and so on.

	- Reach Out to Individual Directors
	  
	  Although the best CEOs spend disproportionate amounts of time with their board chair or lead director, they also invest in building relationships with all of the other board members. ‚ÄúThe board‚Äôs not monolithic,‚Äù GE‚Äôs Larry Culp explains. ‚ÄúYou have ten or twelve individuals who have their own unique views.
