- Chapter 1 - The Truth about relativity
	 - Humans rarely choose things in absolute terms, we lack the ability to tell how much are absolute worth something is, instead we focus on the relative advantage of one thing over another. #[[relative value]]
		 - We usually don't know what we want unless we see it in context.
			 - #[[Lessons Learned]] Provide context to information to influence our audience to a particular view

			 - This is true not only for physical things but also for ephemeral things like experiences (vacations), emotions, attitudes, and points of view
