- As your company quickly scales, the young people you hired early in the company's life-cycle will manage bigger and bigger teams. Some will learn to be good managers fast enough. Others won't.Â 
  
  In dealing with those who don't, you will be in a difficult situation. You want to be transparent with them that they are not succeeding. And then when you decide to "layer" them, you will also want to be transparent with them (they will find out anyway once you start recruiting and will feel betrayed if you didn't already inform them) so that they can be your partner in the search. You will likely feel fear that they will feel de-motivated and perform even worse (or leave) before you can hire, train, and onboard their replacement. (This fear is usually overblown, as most young managers look forward to learning from someone more experienced.) But whether or not you feel this fear, the reality is that you want the team's performance to improve now, and recruiting a new manager from the outside will take time. Much more time than you would like. So, how do you improve the team's performance now?
  
  There is an answer.
  
  Large tech companies like Google and Linkedin have created a function called Business Operations. This function is staffed mainly with top-tier consultants from Bain, McKinsey, and BCG. I first encountered Biz Ops at Coinbase, where Emilie Choi scaled the group out as the company was going through hypergrowth. The team was viewed as mini-CEOS who could:
	- Parachute into any problem area, dig in, and fix it.
	- Build and drive processes that help the company scale, including running quarterly business reviews, OKRs, etc.
	- Join a team where the manager was not succeeding, and take over the project and people management duties while keeping the former manager as the architect.
	- The former manager became the subject matter expert who determined the roadmap: "These are the things that we need to get done, and this is how to do them."
	- The Biz Ops person then managed the team to ensure that they completed the roadmap.
	- Effectively run any meeting and train managers on how to do so.
	- Act as Chief of Staff to the CEO.
- This function has been a big success for Coinbase. I highly recommend that you create such a function.
  
  One logical way to create this function is first to hire a [[Chief of Staff]] (2 min) that fits this spec. Once you have fully trained that person as your CoS, then have them hire another person like them (who reports to them) as the first smoke-jumper. This is now your Biz Ops department. Scale it up from there.
- You may already have a Biz Ops function that reports into Finance or Operations. That is fine. As CEO, you also need a Biz Ops team that reports directly to you and is therefore available to put out any fire in the company, not just those in Finance or Operations. The most efficient structure I have seen is not having another report to the CEO, but rather the CoS to the CEO hiring and managing the overall Biz Ops function. That way, the CEO gets direct access to the function without gaining another report.
  
  It is essential that you always have one Biz Ops resource available. If your CoS or one of the Biz Ops folks wants to manage a department permanently, they may do so. But only after they hire and train their replacement for the CoS or Biz Ops role that they are vacating.
  
  When you send in a smoke-jumper to aid a struggling Manager, it is critical that the Biz Ops person report to that Manager the entire time they are in this position. The role of the Biz Ops person is to make the Manager succeed, not report back what they discover. If, by contrast, the Biz Ops person continues to report to the Head of Biz Ops, the smoke-jumper will be viewed by the struggling Manager as a spy, ensuring a dysfunctional relationship and a bad ending.
