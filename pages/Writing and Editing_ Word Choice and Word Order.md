	- Class Clips
		- Watch these short clips from a class at the University of Michigan Law School:
			- [Painting, Singing, Sculpting, Dancing, Writing ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuM7UWCJz5o&list=PL7g_CQSlG4S-uUaq7bLvXNJmxKdMRDnaf&index=2&t=0s)

	- Errors and Insights
		- Reducing errors will only get us so far, [[Gary Klein]] says. To really excel we also need to learn how to up our insights. We need to generate and absorb new strategies for approaching whatever it is we want to improve. People who can regularly produce high-quality work on schedule add a lot of value in schools and companies and in the wider community.

		- **INSIGHTS on writing**
			- In a separate section of your journal or diary, start writing down some insights. Like with your errors, shoot for three to five. These can be pithy observations you’ve gathered from other lawyers. They can be individual concepts or principles you’ve been taught by former teachers. They can even be ideas you’ve come up with yourself—about structure, about word choice, about anything related to writing, including where and when you seem to produce your best work.
			- To the extent that your __Errors List__ may sound like warnings and admonitions—“Careful about comma splices”; “Don’t overuse dashes”—your __Insights List__ should sound more like epiphanies. Here’s one from Brooks Landon, who has taught creative writing for many years at the University of Iowa.
			- Here’s another, by Verlyn Klinkenborg, the author of the delightfully quirky book __Several Short Sentences About Writing__ and a former member of the editorial board at the __New York Times__.
			- Sit back, and continue to think.
			- That’s where the writing gets done.
			- Finally, here’s a third, by ZZ Packer. Her book [Drinking Coffee Elsewhere](https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/drinking-coffee-elsewhere) was a finalist for the Pen/Faulkner Award in 2000 and also selected by John Updike for the official book club of the __Today Show__.__ __
			- Other good places to look include:
				- A list of Zadie Smith’s [Rules for Writers](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/22/zadie-smith-rules-for-writers) published in __The Guardian__ 2010 .
				- A set of [How I Write](https://www.scribes.org/copy-of-volume-16-3) essays published in __Scribes Journal for Legal Writing__ in 1993. The collection includes pieces by Judge Richard Posner, Judge Patricia Wald, Judge Edith Jones, Judge Tom Gee, Professor Lawrence Friedman, and Professor (and now Senator) Elizabeth Warren.
				- Your notes from the best writing course you took.
				- A friend’s notes from the best writing course they took. (Maybe your friend took a different writing course than you did or maybe they just took different notes. Either way, the additional perspective could lead to some helpful insights.)
				- A post called [Timeless Advice on Writing](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/05/03/advice-on-writing/) created by Maria Popova on brainpickings.org. The advice comes from writers as different as Ernest Hemingway, Stephen King, Jennifer Egan, Isabel Allende, Michael Lewis, Kurt Vonnegut, E.B. White, Susan Sontag, George Orwell, and Jorge Luis Borges.
			- The nice thing about writing is that you are not the first to do it. Plenty of people have taken on the enterprise, and many have left useful tips and techniques to try. An insight can be as simple as discovering that something somebody else does also works well for you.
		- Mechanics and Strategy
			- Writing, I tell my students, is about those two things. It's about **mechanics**, __which you might think of as the how__ of a sentence, paragraph, clause, or phrase, and it is about **strategy**, __which you can think of as the why__ of a sentence, paragraph, clause, or phrase. Importantly, the two go together. The better your mechanics are as a writer, the more advance will be the strategies you're able to implement. The more clearly, you can identify your strategy for a particular piece of writing, the easier it will be to figure out the mechanics necessary to implement it.
		- Performing Under Pressure and Expressive Writing
			- Here are the materials mentioned in the "Mechanics and Strategy" video
				- TODO [["[Worried About Performing Well Under Stress? Write It Out](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/choke/201101/worried-about-performing-well-under-stress-write-it-out)" " by Sian Beilock"]]
					- Writing about our thoughts and feelings immediately before a highly stressful event can help boost our performance. Worrying and stress can rob us of our brainpower because it affects the part of the brain's working memory, lodged in our prefrontal cortex. The more we worry and are stressed, we perform much more poorly.
						- The prefrontal cortex and is a sort of mental scratch pad that allows people to "work" with information relevant to the task at hand.
						- Research has shown that expressive writing about stressful or traumatic experiences is effective in decreasing worries in clinically depressed individuals.
							- Writing allows us to identify the causes of our anxiety and stress, preventing rumination and catastrophizing. It allows us to slow down our Systems 1 thinking and incorporate Systems 2 Thinking
				- TODO [Expressive Writing in Psychological Science](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691617707315) by James Pennebaker
					- Concealing or holding back powerful emotions, thoughts, and behaviors is stressful.
	- **Map to a Decision**
		- Start by reading The Words Under the Words chapter in Good with Words, as well as if you want the optional reading from the Syntax of Sports.
			- The Words Under the Words (Concept)
				- Read the "[Concept Section](https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/bz60cx60t?locale=en#/6/18[mup-mpsbarry-0009]!/4/2[ch01]/2/6/1:0)" in Chapter 1 ("The Words Under the Words") of [__Good With Words: Writing and Editing__](https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/1v53jz538)__. __Stop when you get to the heading "A Note About Me." If you are using the print version of the book, the relevant pages are 1-8.
					- **We can influence the decisions people make through [[Framing]]. The words we make can change the decisions people make. We can frame through our word choices.** For example, we can influence people to select a surgery if we frame the outcomes as 90% survivability vs 10% mortality. This is an example of [[[[risk]] averse]] decisions making. ((52f24daf-9b8b-4105-b795-35090ed45a99)) and ((5e3ca707-d4fe-43e3-9001-235c67edb06a)) #[[q: How to influence others]]
						- ^^Think about more than just the straightforward definition of the words you use. Think about the connotations of those words as well—the ideas they might evoke, the reactions they might elicit, the images and emotions they could stir up.^^ The next time you write an email, tell a story, or send someone a text, think about the words under the words in the message you hope to communicate. ^^Think of the subconscious work the words are doing.^^
				- **Optional Additional Reading**
					- [Author's Note](https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/rf55z929h?locale=en#/6/16[mup-mpsbarry2-0008]!/4/2[au_note]/2/4/1:0) and [Chapters 1-11](https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/rf55z929h?locale=en#/6/22[mup-mpsbarry2-0011]!/4/2[ch02]/2/4/1:0) of [__The Syntax of Sports: Class 1__](https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/47429b77j)__. __[Note: These chapters are very short. Many are only a couple of pages.] #Writing
						- ^^Good writing is the best words in their best order.^^
						- ^^Good writing is getting something right in language.^^
						- ^^Good writing is making order out of chaos.^^
						- **Ask ourselves what is the function of this writing and who is the audience of this writing.**
							- **Effective writing is knowing your function to meet the needs of your audience. **

		- Chapter 1: [[Books - Good with Words]]
			- > For [[moral]] behaviors, nouns work better than verbs. To get 3 to 6 year-olds to help with a task, rather than inviting them ‘to help,’ it was 22 to 29 percent more effective to encourage them to ‘be a helper.’ Cheating was cut in half when instead of, ‘Please don’t cheat,’ participants were told, ‘Please don’t be a cheater.’ When our actions become a reflection of our character, we lean more heavily toward the moral and generous choices.”
		- If you want to influence people to make the decision you want them to, make it very easy for them to do so. Create a map so they can do so and describe the benefits and the problem that appeals to them.
	- Better at Getting Better
		- The right source of practice carried out over a sufficient period of time leads to improvement. Nothing else. 
		  id:: 97f72d58-f60a-4c82-9014-cc9cbbe958a1
			- Deliberate practice develop skills that other people already figured out how to do and for which effective training techniques have been established. 
			  id:: 542c5215-a70d-4e11-b5bb-ea32d52c8b57
			- The second element of deliberate practice is, "The practice regimen should be designed and overseen by a teacher or coach who is familiar with the abilities of expert performers."
			  id:: 21ffa11e-c2b9-4b8f-96ae-4d6d4f367c00
			- "Deliberate practice takes place outside one's comfort zone and requires a student to constantly try things that are just beyond their current abilities. Thus it demands near-maximal effort, which is generally not enjoyable."
			  id:: 95b4ecc5-d1e1-45b4-9056-e14ddac52e23
		- **There is no magical way to improve our writing beyond iteration.** There is no magical muse. There is no burst of unimprovable eloquence. There is just hard work and craft.
	- [[Resume]] Review
		- We want to use the "words under the words" concept to effectively market ourselves to businesses
		- Make sure that our resume communicates our breadth and depth of knowledge and expertise
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FRscefQOjqM.png?alt=media&token=2a30d13f-27d9-4361-ace8-7186a43fa644)
			- Breadth, the horizontal part of the T, represents multidisciplinary experiences, talents or education. Breadth helps us to collaborate with cross functional teams and provides us the tools to view the problem in multiple perspectives, empathy. Breadth also allows us to be enthusiastic and curious about other people's discipline, to the point that we may want to actually start to practice them.
			- The vertical portion of the T represents depth and depth allows us to contribute the the creative process of problem solving.
		- Your resume should convey the messages you want to communicate. Use the 6-60-6 framework to edit your resume.
			- If a person had only 6 seconds to view your resume, what impression would they get about you?
			- If people only 60 seconds to read your resume what skills would they think you have?
				- example: good writer, team player, gets stuff done
			- If a person had 6 hours to read your resume what mistakes would they find?

			- Exercise—Résumé Review
				- This self-assessment can be found in the first [Practice Section of Good with Words Chapter 1](https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/bz60cx60t?locale=en#/6/18[mup-mpsbarry-0009]!/4/2[ch01]/146/2/14/3:228).
				- **Background**
					- Résumés are a great place to practice the idea of “the words under the words.” They give you a chance to frame the same person—yourself—in different ways, to different audiences, for different purposes. As a result, they are a helpful reminder of the two most important questions to ask when sitting down to compose anything from a memo to a contract to a tweet:
						- Who is the audience?
						- What is the function?
					- By “function,” I mean: What do you want this piece of writing to do? What’s the goal? How do you want the people reading it to feel and react? Why are you even writing it in the first place?
				- **Assignment**
					- Find three organizations you would like to work for, whether now or sometime later in your career. Check out each organization’s website and other promotional materials. See what kind of language it uses. See what kind of values it communicates. Study the ethos and culture it projects.
					- Then review your current résumé and ask yourself these questions:
						- How can I make the words under the words of my résumé match the words under the words of the organization I hope to work for?
						- How can I describe my education, skills, and experience in a way that will make it easy for the organization to recognize that I would be a great addition to its team?
					- While creating your three new résumés, spend some time thinking about your rich, varied background. Mine it for possible connections with your target audiences and then make an intentionally long list of your many characteristics and competencies. Deciding which ones should be highlighted to which people is an important part of advocacy. And it will be great training for when you might be asked to do this kind of highlighting on behalf of someone else as well as for when you eventually discover important policies and projects you feel passionate about championing.
					- To make this exercise more interesting and helpful, try to pick three organizations that are highly dissimilar. If one organization has an international focus, also pick an organization with a more local focus. If one organization has offices in big cities, also pick an organization that only operates in a single small town. Consider how these differences might affect everything from the projects you decide to describe in your résumé to the items you list in your “Interests” section. The point is to experiment with different versions of yourself and with new ways of saying the same thing.
					- One more note: don’t feel limited to picking only organizations. If there is someone in particular you want to work for one day, create a résumé specifically designed for that person. You’ll learn a lot about what it means to tailor information in a purposeful, laser-like way.
					- Below are some examples of combinations you might choose based on people and offices graduates of Michigan Law have worked for in the past. Although I want you to be pragmatic when picking your own list, I also want you to stretch yourself a bit. Be creative. Be ambitious. Expand your menu of professional options.

		- How to use "un"
			- Notes on Nuance: "Un-"
				- The following material is taken from __Notes on Nuance__ by Patrick Barry (Forthcoming, 2020). [__CC BY 4.0__](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
				- **                                                Chapter 1: "Un-"**
					- "He went back to America unslaved. Unslaved. It was a curious and lovely word, and I liked Manyaki all the more for it."
						- —Colum McCann, __TransAtlantic__ (2013)
					- “I’ve had a lot of experience with the justice system,” Sharif said. “It’s all about un-law and un-care.”
						- —Karan Mahajan, __The Association of Small Bombs__ (2016)
				- **1. Note how one “un-” sometimes attracts another.**
					- “Now it is admitted that the deliberate killing of this unoffending and unresisting boy was clearly murder, unless the killing can be justified by some well-recognized excuse admitted by the law.”
					- —Lord Coleridge, __The Queen vs. Dudley and Stephens__ (1884)
					- “The growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.”
					- —George Eliot, __Middlemarch__ (1871)
				- **2. Note how companies sometimes use “un-” to promote their products.**
					- **__7Up__**__:__ “The Uncola”
					- **__T-Mobile__**__:__ “The Un-Carrier”
					- **__Jimmy John’s Gourmet Sandwiches__**__:__ “The Unwich”
					- **__Labatt Beer__**__:__ “Get Undomesticated”
				- **3. Note how putting “not” before your “un-” word creates a double negative that can then be used to assert something like a positive statement. (These combinations are often called “litotes.”)**
					- “Slim and compact and not unhandsome in his dark suit, he was small—by the time Cecilia was thirteen, both his women overtopped him—with a neatly trimmed beard and brown eyes that were unexpectedly limpid and expressive, suggesting that he held back strong feeling.”
					- —Tessa Hadley, “Celia Awakened” (2018)
					- “There were certain things in life that Bill would go to almost any length to avoid, and one was going to a barbershop. The very idea of the physical intimacy inherent to the hair-cutting process overwhelmed him, and from the time I had met him in California, he had sported long, glossy black hair that was not unreminiscent of Cher’s.”
					- —Hope Jahren, __Lab Girl__ (2016)
					- “But when the feasting was over, the villagers told themselves that they had underrated the power of the ballot paper before and should not do so again. Chief the Honorable Marcus Ibe was not unprepared. He had drawn five months’ salary in advance, changed a few hundred pounds into shining shillings and armed his campaign boys with eloquent little jute bags.”
					- —Chinua Achebe, “The Voter” (1965)
				- **4. Note how not everyone is a fan of using “un-” this way.**
					- “One can cure oneself of the __not un-__formation by memorizing this sentence: __A not__ __unblack____ dog was chasing a not__ __unsmall____ rabbit across a__ __not ungreen field____.”__

		- **Good sentences** -
			- Chapter 9: [[Books - Good with Words]]
				- To write good sentences, you need to read good sentences
				- > Embrace this craft-like approach to reading. Pay attention not just to a passage’s content but to its composition, to how it was put together word by word, sentence by sentence. Study how paragraphs are constructed, how their various parts work together to communicate information clearly, effectively, and sometimes beautifully. Your writing will improve. Your rhythm will improve. Your readers will be grateful
				- http://libguides.law.umich.edu/goodsentences/home - example of good writing (Good Sentences Library)
				- Exercise—Good Sentences (Education)
					- "[__New York Times__ columnist William Safire] gave me the best advice I ever got as a writer, which is never to feel guilty about how much you read."
						- __                                   —__Peggy Noonan__, The Time of Our Lives: Collected Writings__ (2015)
					- To write good sentences, you need to read good sentences. So each week we will make sure to treat our brains to some high-quality material. You'll have a lot of choices to pick from. The only requirement is the one I mentioned in the Good Sentences video: pick your favorite sentence and write it out.
					- Don’t copy and paste the sentence. Actually handwrite or type it. The point is to start to internalize the rhythm and structure of the kind of writing we ultimately want to produce  ourselves.
					- You'll have an opportunity to share your pick (or some other good sentence you read this week) in the discussion prompt that follows this activity. You'll also, next week, get the chance to choose from a different menu of options.
					- Option #1
					- Choose something from the [Education](http://libguides.law.umich.edu/goodsentences/topics/education-law) section of the [Good Sentences](https://libguides.law.umich.edu/goodsentences)* library. Here are a few to consider.

		- **Reflect on our consumed knowledge.**
			- Consuming knowledge without taking investing time in reflection is wasteful. Don't get caught up in the rush to collect more facts and data. Information without reflection is knowledge undigested, knowledge not understood. Facts and data transform to knowledge when when comprehend, not merely through reading or even note taking. And understanding, comprehension, means that the various parts of the information acquired are grasped in the relation to one another -- a result that is attained only when acquisition is accompanied by constant reflection upon the meaning of what is studied." John Dewey on "How We Learn"

  collapsed:: true
	- TODO Read:[ Learning by Thinking: How Reflection Improves Performance](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/learning-by-thinking-how-reflection-improves-performance) by Giada Di Stefano, Francesca Gino, Gary Pisano, and Bradley Staats (Harvard Business School, 2014)
		- They argue that learning from direct experience can be more effective if coupled with reflection—that is, the intentional attempt to synthesize, abstract, and articulate the key lessons taught by experience.
		- Reflecting on what has been learned makes experience more productive.
		- Reflection builds one's confidence in the ability to achieve a goal (i.e., self-efficacy), which in turn translates into higher rates of learning.
			- the effect of reflection on learning is mediated by greater perceived ability to achieve a goal (i.e., self-efficacy).
	- The Infinite Power of Grammar (Chapter 2 of Good with Words)
		- syntax is the arrangement of words in a sentence. “To shift the structure of a sentence,” she explains, “alters the meaning of that sentence, as definitely and inflexibly as the position of the camera alters the meaning of the object photographed.”
		- Learn the infinite power of grammar. Remember that the order of words can be flipped and shifted, that new insights are often triggered by new configurations. Yes, you should edit by deleting words. Yes, you should edit by adding words. But you should also edit by rearranging them. Said differently: Keep the content—just change the location.
			- Doing this will help you create clearer, more effective sequences and combinations. It will also teach you not to treat as fixed and immovable any structure you write or inherit.
			- When writing keep in mind the focus of whom your writing is focused on. You may inadvertently attach an unintended adjective to them.
	- Exercise - Interrupting Elements
		- Avoid interrupting subjects and verbs with long phrases and clauses, the site explained that “when readers do not see a verb right after a subject, the sentence is probably more difficult than it has to be.”
			- It then recommended shifting an interrupting element to either the end or the beginning of the sentence, depending on where the element fits better. Here’s the example the site offered:
				- **Original Version:** Some scientists, because they write in a style that is so impersonal and objective, do not communicate with laypeople easily.
				- **Clearer and More Direct Version:** Some scientists do not communicate with laypeople easily, because they write in a style that is so impersonal and objective.
			- The advice reinforces a broader principle on the site: “Get to verbs quickly.” Readers typically don’t like to have to wait to figure out the main action of the sentence. They get confused. They get distracted. Their brains hurt.
	- Passive on Purpose
		- The passive voice gets a bad rap. Check out at least one of the resources below to learn when you might use it strategically.
			- [Passive Resistance](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/11/passive-resistance/380787/) by Steven Pinker (__The Atlantic__, 2014)

	- **Chapter Two: "Almost" and "Even"**
		- "When I turned on the landing of the Lyceum stairs, I was shocked to see him sitting in the windowsill. I glanced at him quickly, and then quickly turned away, and was about to walk into the hall when he said, “Wait.” His voice was cool and Bostonian, __almost__ British."
			- —Donna Tartt, __The Secret History__ (1992)
		- "Snoopy had his origins in Spike, the dog of Schulz’s youth, whom Sparky called “the wildest and the smartest dog I’ve ever encountered,” and as long as Snoopy was treated as a pet—an eccentric, __even__ a lunatic, household dog—by the __Peanuts__ gang, he evinced Spike-like behavior."
			- —David Michaelis, __Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography__ (2007)
		- **1. Note how “almost” helps writers reach toward a more extreme word without fully committing to it.**
			- “Oswaldo was flummoxed by the fact that his friend could be so quiet, __almost__ embarrassed, about his academic acumen, yet so damn loud and proud of his status as a premier campus drug dealer.”
				- —Jeff Hobbs, __The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace__ (2014)
			- “Next to it was Begman Bags and Hats, which must have remained unchanged in terms of its interior and range from the day it was founded in the forties, and Radio City, which had just gone bankrupt, but you could still see a window full of illuminated TV screens, surrounded by a wide selection of electrical goods, with prices written on large, __almost__ luminous orange-and-green bits of cardboard.”
				- —Karl Ove Knausgaard, __My Struggle: Book 2: A Man in Love__ (2013)
		- **2. Note how “even” functions in a similar way.**
			- “Their more extreme admirers will tell you that imagination and invention are outmoded contrivances; that to inhabit the subjectivity of a character unlike the author is an act of appropriation, even colonialism; that the only authentic and politically defensible mode of narrative is an autobiography.”
				- —Jonathan Franzen, introduction to __The Best American Essays__ (2016)
			- “There, he began to feel some actual joy, even exhilaration, which made him want to leap forward and grab every woman who vaguely resembled the latest pictures she had sent him, all of which he had neatly framed and hung on the walls of his room.”
				- —Edwidge Danticat, “Seven” (2002)
		- **3. Note how “almost” is sometimes set off by dashes**.
			- “Our dawning Age of Anxiety is perfectly symbolized by the mysterious—the almost mystical—figure of Benjamin Nathan Cardozo.”
			- —Grant Gilmore, __The Ages of American Law__ (1977)
		- **4. Note how “even” is sometimes set off by dashes.**
			- “Both my father and my grandmother believed that Jagu’s and Rejsh’s mental illnesses had been precipitated—even caused, perhaps—by the apocalypse of Partition, its political trauma sublimated into their psychic trauma.”
			- —Siddhartha Mukherjee, __The Gene: An Intimate History__ (2016)
		- **5. Note how “almost” often comes after one adjective to form a pair.**
			- “He looked startled, almost afraid.”
			- —Octavia Butler, __Fledgling__ (2005)
		- **6. Note how “even” often comes after one adjective to form a pair.**
			- “They were thick, even plump looking hands, and they moved in the same inarticulate, blind way if they picked up a salt shaker or the handle of a suitcase.”
			- —Patricia Highsmith, __Carol__ (1952)
		- **7. Note how “almost” occasionally comes after two adjectives to form a series.**
			- “One could scarcely read these lines in any other than a quiet, musing, almost whispered way.”
			- —Mary Oliver, __A Poetry Handbook__ (1994)
		- **8. Note how “even” occasionally does too.**
			- “The choices we discern as having been made in the Constitutional Convention impose burdens on governmental processes that often seem clumsy, inefficient, even unworkable, but those hard choices were consciously made by men who had lived under a form of government that permitted arbitrary governmental acts to go unchecked.”
			- —Chief Justice Warren Burger, __INS v. Chadha__ (1982)
		- **9. Note how “almost” doesn’t have to come after any adjective. It can simply appear alone.**
			- “Mr. Carton’s manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He stood half-turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar.”
			- —Charles Dickens, __A Tale of Two Cities__ (1859)
			- “His willingness, which was almost an eagerness.”
			- —Michael Lewis, __The Undoing Project: How a Friendship Changed Our World__ (2016)
		- **10. Note how “almost” and “even” can come after the words they modify, appearing in a slightly different position than in all the previous examples. Play around with both arrangements. Take advantage of each word’s flexibility.**
			- “Reluctantly, Jay got out of the car. Instead of heading for the club, though, he just stood there, staring at Tim, pleading almost, as if he wanted to be talked out of what he was about to do. But it was his choice, and Tim couldn’t make it for him.”
			- —Tom Perrotta,__ The Abstinence Teacher__ (2010)
			- “I still resent it when anyone at my table seasons something as soon as it is put before him. I know that his tongue is jaded, calloused even, by restaurant sauces and a thousand dinners that have had to be heightened with anything at hand in order to be swallowed at all.”
			- —M. F. K. Fisher, “M. F. K. Fisher on the Basics” (1949)
		- **11. Note how “almost” and “even” can be nice additions to poems**
			- “I’m greeted, mingling, and the air when it’s still
			  momentarily turns into an earthy, almost stifling
			  cloud of mixed perfumes, of bouquets and sweats.”
			  —Dan Howell, “Chicago Epithalion” (2004)
			- “Admit you’d like to find something
			  discarded or damaged, even gone,
			  and lift it back into the world.”
			  —Stephen Dunn, “Dismantling the House” (2016)

	- Phrasemakers
		- The focus of this chapter has been on phrases because if you learn how to create effective phrases, you can learn how to create effective sentences; and if you learn how to create effective sentences, you can learn how to create effective paragraphs; and if you learn how to create effective paragraphs, you can produce some really great writing.
		- ^^Writing, the linguist John DeFrancis has suggested, is “visible speech.”^^[28](https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/bz60cx60t/OEBPS/mup-mpsbarry-0022.xhtml#en67) It is a way of communicating sound and meaning through symbols. Neglect that sound, neglect the possibility for rhythm and melody in sentences, the chance to use pace and harmony, tone and expressiveness—neglect all those musical elements and you neglect much of what gives words their value. As the poet Robert Frost remarked in a letter to a friend in 1914, “The ear is the only true writer and the only true reader.”
	- Alliteration
		- [2018-fall-article-5.pdf (thomsonreuters.com)](https://static.legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/static/pdf/perspectives/2018-fall/2018-fall-article-5.pdf)
			- Every phrase or sentence or paragraph that is put together could be put together differently. There is judgment involved. There is, to use a phrase one of my own law professors, James Boyd White, used all the time in class, “a mind at work.” What I love about alliteration is the way it calls attention to this process.
			- It’s sort of like an observation the journalist Ben Yagoda makes in another book on writing, The Sound on the Page. “Writers who are unaware of or uninterested in readers are like people who don’t look at you when they’re speaking to you.”17 If you are going to use alliteration, or any other writing move, it should be with the reader in mind. Will this construction help my audience better understand and remember what I am trying to communicate? Will it inform them? Will it persuade them? Will it entertain or improve them? If not, then by all means: go ahead and kill your darlings. A darling without a specific purpose is not much of a darling at all.

	- **Notes on Nuance - "To"**
	  collapsed:: true
		- The preposition to can helpfully link three items, as in the following sentence about Thomas Jefferson from the book American Creation by historian Joseph Ellis.
			- _To be sure, Jefferson was a sincere aficionado of all things Gallic, from French cooking to Parisian architecture to revolutionary politics._
		- But although three items seems to be this move’s sweet spot, it can also link both less than three items and more than three items. Here’s an example where to links less than three items. It comes from the book Biased by Stanford sociologist Jennifer Eberhardt.
			- _Bias can lead to racial disparities in everything from preschool suspensions to corporate leadership._
		- A similarly extreme example appears in The Triumph of Christianity: How a Forbidden Religion Swept the World by Bart Ehrman, a historian of religion who teaches at the University of North Carolina. The author of a number of best-selling books, Ehrman uses the to move to explain the pervasive role gods played during the fourth century, when the emperor Constantine made his influential conversion to the Christian faith.
			- _On the practical level, the gods were understood to be closely connected with every aspect of the social and political life of a community, from the election of officials, to the setting of the annual calendar, to the law and practices that governed social relations, such as marriage and divorce, to the administration of civil justice, to the decisions and actions of war, to all the other major decisions of state._
		- **Note how “to” can cover and connect a large range of material.**
			- _“The conception of political equality from the Declaration of Independence, to Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, to the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments can mean only one thing—one person, one vote.”_
				- —Justice William O. Douglas, Gray v. Sanders (1963)7
			- _“Throughout this vast republic, from the St. Croix to the Gulf of Mexico, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, revenue is to be collected and expended, armies are to be marched and supported.”_
				- —Chief Justice John Marshall, McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)
		- **Note how “to” works well with a list of three items.**
			- _“This technique can be used in nearly any area: put together a group of people all interested in the same thing—or join an existing group—and use the group’s camaraderie and shared goals as extra motivation in reaching your own goals. This is the idea behind many social organizations, from book clubs to chess clubs to community theaters, and joining—or, if necessary, forming—such a group can be a tremendous way for adults to maintain motivation.”_
				- —Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool, Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise (2016)
		- **Note how “to” can also work well with just two items.**
			- _“For now, [Martin Luther King Jr.’s] notion of leadership emphasized the display of learning. He said many wise things in his address—on technology, colonialism, the pace of time, but the speech as a whole went sprawling. King quoted notables from Heraclitus ^^to^^ Bob Hope.”_
				- —Taylor Branch, Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954–1963 (1988)10
		- **Note how “to” is often combined with alliteration.**
			- _“Venture capitalists have poured money into start-ups aiming to disrupt everything from lingerie to luggage to lipstick, with less emphasis on the product than on the scope of the ambition and the promise of tech-enabled efficiencies.”_
				- —Bianca Bosker, “Mayonnaise, Disrupted” (2017)11
			- _“From Boston to Bordeaux, revolution was in large measure the achievement of networks of wordsmiths.”_
			- —Niall Ferguson, The Square and the Tower: Networks and Power, from the Freemasons to Facebook (2017)12
		- **Note how “to” sometimes appears with commas and sometimes doesn’t. The difference seems to be how fast you want the reader to get through the list.**
			- _“This meant he was involved in everything from designing user interfaces, to testing with customers and reviewing specifications, to coordinating with engineers.”_
				- —Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky, Make Time (2018)13
			- _“As always, we illustrate these translations using a wide range of applications, everything from fixing leaky toilets to increasing charitable giving to finding a job or mate.”_
				- —Barry Nalebuff and Ian Ayres, Why Not? How to Use Everyday Ingenuity to Solve Problems Big and Small (2003)14
		- **Note how “to” can be helpful when crafting online bios and similar descriptions of experience and expertise.**
			- “From Seoul ^^to^^ Krakow ^^to^^ Vancouver, Professor Cohen has spoken at legal, medical, and industry conferences around the world and his work has appeared in or been covered on PBS, NPR, ABC, CNN, MSNBC, Mother Jones, the New York Times, the New Republic, the Boston Globe, and several other media venues.”
				- —faculty bio for Professor I. Glenn Cohen, Harvard Law School (2019)15
			- “Mr. Horwich has briefed and argued cases before all levels of the federal courts, including arguing 10 cases in the Supreme Court of the United States. His industry experience ranges from pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and food production and marketing, ^^to^^ banking, surface and air transportation, semiconductors, and energy.”
				- —attorney bio for Benjamin J. Horwich, Munger, Tolles & Olson (2019)16
		- **Note how “to” can also connect more than two or three items.**
			- _“The implications of writing signals into the brain, or ‘neuromodulation,’ however, were far more wide-reaching than that: being able to control neural firing would conceivably allow treatment of a host of currently untreatable or intractable neurological and psychiatric diseases, from major depression to Huntington’s to schizophrenia to Tourette’s to OCD . . . the possibilities were limitless.”_
