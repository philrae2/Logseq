				- Connections
					- Learners make connections with what they already know about the training topic, with what they will learn, with what they want to learn and with each other.
				- Concepts
					- Learners take in new information in multisensory ways: hearing, seeing, discussing, writing, reflecting, imagining, participating, and teaching it to others.
				- Concrete Practice
					- Learners actively practice the new skills, or they participate in an active review of the new knowledge they have learned
				- Conclusions
					- Learners summarize what they have learned, evaluate it, celebrate it, and create action plans for how they plan to use the new knowledge or skills after the training is over.
			- Learning, enabling learners to remember and use the information you give them, requires involvement and engagement during the entire training—high interest, content-related, physically active involvement—where they are teaching and learning from each other.
				- In order to increase learning you must give learners time to discuss, question, move, act, participate, teach and learn from each other.
			- If you are doing most of the talking in a training program, then you aren't teaching you're delivering content.
		- Brain-Friendly Training
			- People become bored and begin to daydream when they are doing routine or repetitive tasks, when they are reading or listening to uninteresting information, when they stay in one physical position for too long, and when environments never change.
			- Brain-friendly training is about designing and delivering instruction in ways that the human brain learns best. It includes:
				- Learning something for the sheer joy of it
				- Learning something you want to learn
				- Feeling accomplish after learning it
				- Learning what you needed, when you needed it, and at your own pace
				- Learning how you choose to learn it
				- Learning by doing instead of watching someone else do it
				- Learning by teaching
				- Learning in an informal environment, where collaboration was encouraged, competition was deemphasized, and mistakes were viewed as necessary part of the learning process.
			- Brain-friendly Training uses the five general elements to enhance learning:
				- Positive emotional experiences
					- Anything that is attached to emotions, either negative or positive, will grab—and keep—our attention longer than anything that isn't. The brain constantly uses emotion and to determine what is, and isn't, important. It causes us to focus on the things that seem important, while monitoring or ignoring the unimportant.
					- We are willing to participate in training that creates pleasant feelings (as in "I feel respected, competent, or smart" as opposed to "I feel bored, stupid, or humiliated"). The information or skills to be learned can be very challenging, but if we feel confident that we can learn, we will learn more quickly than if we learn because we are told to we have to learn or run the risk of failure if we don't.
				- Multi-sensory stimulation and novelty
					- Information-delivery that lasts longer than ten minutes (close enough is okay—twenty minutes will still work; anything longer probably won't) will see diminishing return in terms of how much information learners will remember.
					- The brain doesn't receive information well when the body is totally passive and the only sensory stimulation is auditory.
					- Any stimuli introduced into our immediate environment, which is either new (novel) or of sufficiently strong emotional intensity, will immediately gain our attention.
					- Movement and timing are two ways of including multisensory stimulation and novelty in training.
				- Instructional variety and choices
				- Active participation and collaboration
				- Informal learning environments
