- Notes:
	- Notetaking
		- When you are taking notes, don't bother doing stupid things like highlighting or underlining sentences in the textbook. There is no evidence that it works. It just looks like work. What you need to do is to read for understanding. Read a bit, then write down what you have learned or any questions that have arisen in your mind. Don't ever copy the source word for word. The most important part of learning and remembering is the recreation of what you have written in your own language. This is not some simplistic "use your own words." This is the dialog you are having with the writer of your sources. This is your attempt to say back to the author "this is what I understand you are saying." This is where you extract the gist of the writing.
		- Eliminate the extra detail, and concentrate on the communicating what is important.
