	 - Reference: [[Books: The courage to be disliked]]
		 - If we don't see others as enemies or rivals in competition we would make friends easier, trust more, and see others as comradesâ€”people for who we can create value.
			 - When we see the world with people as our comrades then our view will completely change, the world will look safe and pleasant. Having this mindset will allow us to create value and give to others easier without feeling that giving is throwing away our advantage.  Without competition giving will be easier.       

		 - Often people who are strategic with their communications and are against transparent and honest dialogue are operating from a competitive mindset. 

		 - In competition, we other's successes as our defeat and we can't celebrate other people's successes.
