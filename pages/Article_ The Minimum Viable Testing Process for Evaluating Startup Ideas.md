	- This article speaks more to a competitive software deliver trying to create something novel. For a company that is hired or contracted to create custom software the ideas in this article does not apply.

	- The Minimal Viable Testing Process is an alternative approach to the Minimum Viable Product. An MVT, does not attempt to look like the eventual product. It‚Äôs rather a specific test of an assumption that¬†__must__¬†be true for the business to succeed.  The MVP, on the other hand, is a basic early version of a product that looks and feels like a simplified version of the eventual vision.
		- We started by testing specific¬†__hypotheses__¬†that we had about a market. We evaluated the veracity of those hypotheses individually using Minimum Viable Tests. Collectively, these tests allowed us to predict whether a market was going to appreciate our product before we even launched an MVP.
	- In the MVP strategy, you have no strategy: You throw things at a wall until it sticks. In the MVT world, you take your time to discover a strategy but once you have one, you move forward with conviction. By moving forward with conviction, you more appropriately match the realities of startups: It takes two to four years to know if you‚Äôre right.

	- THE CASE AGAINST THE MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT:
		- I like the idea of a Minimum Viable Test because something about the MVP concept leads people to over-build.
			- First, their vision is bigger than their insight. Product creators like to think of what‚Äôs possible: They dream about how introducing their product into the market might change the world. This is an appropriate framing ‚Äî as long as it comes with a bit of humble pie. New products don‚Äôt succeed because of the wide breadth of features they provide. Facebook isn‚Äôt successful because it allows people to build groups, host events or post photos of their dogs. Instead, Facebook is successful because of one core insight: People want to connect with their friends and family online. You can‚Äôt have 20 insights and be successful ‚Äî you must have just one.
			- If you build an MVP, you start to think about the 20 features you might build to make people happy in a market, which takes your eye off the one specific insight that the customer actually cares about. Purity breeds success.

		- ^^Second, founders over-focus on what the customer says. Customers don‚Äôt know what the product should be.^^ It doesn‚Äôt matter who they are; this is reality. People (including me!) don‚Äôt see themselves clearly ‚Äî and therefore are blind to what they actually want and how they actually make decisions. The entire field of behavioral economics has been created because of how predictably irrational consumers are. Furthermore, they don‚Äôt concern themselves with the future of your industry. They‚Äôll always say they want a ‚Äúfaster horse,‚Äù when in reality they may actually want a car. ^^So if you rely on your customers to tell you what to build, you will invariably build incremental improvements instead of delivering a novel breakthrough.^^

		- Third, founders get caught up in company-building before nailing product/market fit. ^^Building is secondary to delivering value.^^ It is amazing to me how many people print company swag, come up with a name, hire a team, raise capital or design a logo before they know how they are going to deliver value and to whom. Except for when practically required, you should avoid attaching yourself and your identity to titles such as CXO, ‚Äúfounder‚Äù or anything. (Sometimes for the sake of fundraising or hiring, I‚Äôll use the CEO or co-founder title, but only for that purpose. I won‚Äôt introduce myself that way in social settings or allow it to infiltrate my personal identity until after the company starts to accomplish something.)

				- This is false because the Sprint process further breaks down the MVP into testable, iterative ideas that can be improved before the MVP launches.
			- ((cbccacbb-0e8f-424b-b27a-ff00a4c2136c))
				- This is an over-simplication. The One thing that the customers may care about can be further broken down to multiple things.
			- ((3ff80c80-2638-4aa7-871e-d1100b3c6d4d))
				- This sentiment speaks to a different field of software development where competition thrives for users rather than clients who want to build custom software.
