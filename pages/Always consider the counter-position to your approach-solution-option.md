- **Note:**
	 - Be humble in your solutions and always question it. Consider the counter-position that another person may have to your solutions and options.

	 - We often grow complacent or overconfident in our intelligence, talents, and skills. This can lead to poor decision-making and missed opportunities for finding the optimal outcomes.
