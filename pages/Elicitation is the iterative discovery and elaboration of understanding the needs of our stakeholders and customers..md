- **Note:**
	 - Elicitation of requirements is an ongoing and changing process. We don't stop paying attention the requirements when we write it down the first time. 

	 - Throughout the development process make sure that you refine, elaborate, and discover the many facets of the initial requirements.

	 - Explore different perspectives of the requirements, even a separate or different perspective from the product owner who stated it in the first place.
