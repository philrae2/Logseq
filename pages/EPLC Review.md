- EPLC Documents Review
	 - Assumptions
		 - The EPLC is a waterfall methodology?

	 - Business Needs Statement
		 - Recommendation
			 - Not needed by PM

			 - Outside the scope of PM responsibilities

	 - Business Requirements Document - Orange  Book
		 - Incomplete with missing sections that are important
			 - Assumptions section is thin

			 - Sections are missing.

		 - Content and sections different from what EPLC template requests
			 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FstfgSmMneE.png?alt=media&token=fcc53508-125f-4436-b968-542bd4c8f898)

		 - Important Sections
			 - Executive Summary
				 - Business Goals/Objectives to be achieved from Product Owner

				 - Benefits/Rationale

				 - Stakeholder analysis

				 - Project Dependencies

			 - Assumptions and Constraints

			 - Requirements Scope

			 - Functional Requirements
				 - Actor Profiles Specification

				 - Essential Use Case Diagram

				 - Essential Use Case Specifications

				 - Use Case Narrative

			 - Data Requirements

			 - Non-functional requirements

		 - Constraints
			 - The BRD document can't be fully completed because the writing is happening before the requirements gathering sessions happened.

		 - Recommended actions
			 - BRD should be updated and provide the requested sections
				 - This is to make sure the discussions that should happen happen

	 - Capacity Planning
		 - Recommendation
			 - Maybe helpful topic to discuss and document for certain projects?

			 - Is capacity planning a topic discussed on an implementation level or Nexus wide level?

	 - Change Management Plan (Process for changes to user stories/backlog?)
		 - Assumptions
			 - Change Management Plan is a waterfall artifact?
				 - The equivalent is allowing for change on user stories and tickets?

		 - Recommendation
			 - Use this document or modified version for Agile to provide documentation and education for Product Owners for requesting changes

			 - Provides for expectations and a shared understanding of the procedures

	 - Communication Management Plan
		 - Would be useful? 

		 - Maybe too administrative and busywork documentation.

	 - Design Documents and Components
		 - Would  be helpful to study the solution design to ensure full understanding and elicitation of questions

		 - This document would be updated every sprint

	 - Data Conversion
		 - Useful data migration or data needs to be thoughtful
