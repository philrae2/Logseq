- #[[Literature Notes]]
	 - [[Being happy is not the only or most important goal in life]]

	 - [[When we deem something predictable or boring we stop thinking critically and start to think automaticallyâ€”we stop being curious]]

	 - [[We waste too much time worrying about possibilities that may never happen and if they do, the consequences are insignificant]]

	 - [[We try to gain certainty and closure to our problems and unanswered questions because it makes us feel comfortable]]

	 - [[We make worse decisions and are more ignorant by seeking out certainty and confidence]]

	 - #belonging #tribalism #worry
		 - Our brains are wired to fear rejection from the group because it is more beneficial for an individual to belong in a group than work alone. 
id:: b25f439c-2a37-443e-a556-8bd60f16cbfe
			 - We worried about being rejected by the group due to our ability to contribute.

		 - In primitive times, worrying helped us survive by sensing danger more often, even if we were wrong. However this worry now is not us helpful in a more safe and modern environment.

		 - In modernity, worriers spend a lot of time worrying about possibilities that are unlikely to happen and if they do, the consequences are rarely as bas we think they will be.

			 - We end up comparing ourselves to others as not stronger, smarter, more attractive, and better equipped to handle life. We end up negatively judging ourselves.

		 - The opposite of worry is [[positivity offset]]

	 - #Certainty #variability
		 - We may gain comfort in seeking certainty and [[control]] of our circumstances but it is often [[uncertainty]] and challenge that bring the most profound and longest-lasting benefits.

		 - Curiosity is about discovery, the need for certainty is about being right. 

		 - Curiosity creates relationships; the need for certainty creates [[defensiveness]]

	 - #confidence Curiosity is a counterbalance to certainty, closure and confidence
id:: 07b46774-60a5-4f56-8583-5c2403d9cc39
		 - When we seek certainty, we are turning off our curiosity so we can feel confident about or decisions and choices. We are looking to close off our discovery process sooner than later. 
id:: 333a47f1-8439-4630-8eca-b45173a247eb
			 - We become terrible explorers when we investigate with a closed mind and lack of awareness for the sake of certainty. 
id:: 94f75181-8987-4c0b-a91b-75e1a0c39dab

	 - #[[Decision Making]]
		 - Lack of curiosity breeds inflated [[confidence]] and [[ignorance]] that leads to poor decisions.
id:: e3a21916-07cd-46c6-8056-658b3a0542a4

		 - We need to correctly balance certainty and curiosity so we don't end our exploration and discovery too early. 
id:: d2d91b1b-f9cd-4d29-9019-660f8a075335

	 - #discovery
		 - When we are curious we become curiouser and curiouser. We start to notice the gaps and opportunities for growth and improvement in our environments that was not apparent before in our non-curious state.
			 - Our [[expertise]] gained from our curious states provides us more clarity to see those [[opportunities]].

	 - #focus #mindfulness
		 - Curiosity inspire [[attention]]: Where you go, if there is [[mindfulness]] there is curiosity
			 - mindfulness allows us to face stress and hardships in a way that minimizes suffering and maximizes fulfillment

			 - mindfulness is living in the present moment, being nonjudgmental, accepting, compassionate, and open.

		 - Focus or concentration is not mindfulness. While concentration or focus is helpful especially in dangerous situations, it costs us lost moments as we narrow our field of view. Concentration and focused is planned and regimented, while mindfulness is flexible.

	 - #intelligence
		 - Higher curiosity is tied to analytic ability, problem-solving skills, and overall intelligence. 

	 - To measure happiness we naturally will need to compare and judge, in turn we can create a sense of need and want. We can find our selves in an endless loop of happiness seeking.

		 - Instead of constantly trying to be happy, we should focus on building a rich, meaningful life, guided by our core values and interests.

	 - **What is the central ingredient to creating a fulfilling life?**
		 - Curiosity.

	 - We often make the mistakes that growth opportunities end once something or something has become ingrained in our daily routines. When things become predictable, we stop thinking critically and start to think automatically.

		 - ^^As soon as we think we understand something we stop paying attention and take mental shortcuts to thinking. ^^
id:: 6680037a-f6dd-4352-9819-c5735858bc31

		 - We pay attention to the new but forget to notice there is always something to learn in the familiar. There is not two events that are the same if you look far out enough. 

		 - Curiosity is how we relate to to our thoughts and feelings. It's not about whether we pay attention but how we pay attention to what is happening in the present. 

		 - When we are curious we are energized, open, and receptive to finding opportunities, making discoveries, and adding to the meaning in our life. 

	 - #knowledge #[[Growth Mindset]] Curiosity transforms trivial moments for opportunities of profound intimacy, [[insight]]s and meaning in life.
		 - We can ascribe curiosity as a contributing attribute of successful people from history.

		 - Curiosity is a motivating factor that allows us to take risks and leave the familiar even though the act of exploring is uncomfortable and anxious.

		 - Curiosity ends with increasing our existing knowledge, skills, and competencies as we explore the nooks and crannies of experiences.

		 - Resist the opposing craving for [[certainty]] because we can gain the greatest rewards when we question [[authority]], question the status quo, question our beliefs, and question everything.

		 - Living a life of curiosity isn't about ignoring risks but about our willingness to chase and live out our values,  in spite of the fear and risk.   

		 - Being curious means we explore. By exploring we discover. When this is satisfying we are more likely to repeat it. Through repetition we develop competence and mastery. By developing [[mastery]] and [[competence]], our knowledge and [[skills]] grow.

	 - Curiosity is the alternative mindset to analyze and categorize our experiences apart from closure and certainty.
		 - We can extend the happiness from positive new experiences by staying curiosity rather than cutting the same happy thoughts by pursuing a mindset of closure and certainty. 

		 - Instead of trying to control the world through certainty and closure we embrace uncertainty.
			 - ^^Don't take positive events for granted we explore them further.^^

	 - #learning
		 - Second-hand learning and growth (through listening, watching, and reading) is often as good as getting it firsthand, without incurring the firsthand consequences

	 - #personality - __cultivating a curious personality__
		 - Highly curious people feel more intense of feelings of curiosity, interest, and wonder.
			 - They show a preference for novelty, variety, and complexity.

		 - Highly curious people feel more curious often. 

		 - Their feeling of curiosity endures for a longer time. 

		 - They are curious with a large breadth of things in their life and with great depth. 

		 - [[neural plasticity]] - We can change our personality through repeated exposure and experiences

		 - Adults who continue to have a curious personality have had:
			 - __Rich lives, consisting of both and negative experiences __

			 - __Actively searching for meaning in life (this includes questioning authority and dominant, widely accepted ideas)__

			 - __Chose careers that gave them opportunities to be genuine, authentic, and creative.__

			 - __Didn't experience themselves as being restricted to social norms__

			 - These qualities suggest characteristics and traits to retain curiosity throughout life.

			 - The antithesis of these qualities, seeking security, avoiding distress, and sticking to a comfortable routine lessens one's curiosity and, in turn, satisfaction and meaning in life.

			 - To become more curious we need to change our mindsets and take on a more curious mindset in the minutes and moments as the hours and the days will take care of themselves. 

	 - #pleasure
		 - Curiosity of the unknown extends our pleasure. 
			 - ex. Telling people that they will get to drink (between water or Koo-Aid), but not telling them which excites the brain more than telling people what drink they will get

			 - When random strangers are kind to us, we get more pleasure because we don't know or understand the reasoning for these acts of kindness. 

	 - #play
		 - Play is the blending of curiosity and joy. It is a training ground for children for social interactions and problem solving. 

		 - In play we can experiment and try new things. Play can be the precursor activity for change.

	 - #[[positivity offset]]
		 - When we feel safe we are biased to explore new things and seek out new experiences.

	 - #[[relationship building]]
		 - Curious people ask questions and take an interest in learning about partners, and intentionally  try to keep interactions interesting and playful. 

	 - #worry
		 - ((0953e756-7b5e-4c7b-b2eb-3ab2ee1864d0))

		 - ((4dfbcf7f-63b1-448a-a9f1-b2b2c53534c0))

		 - In modernity, even in unknown territory learning toward exploring instead of avoiding is the key to a rich and meaningful life. 

	 - ^^Coping with negative experiences and exhibiting psychological flexibility is the springboard to peak experiences and personal growth.^^ Both the positive and negative in our lives need to be addressed.  Anything less fails to achieve living a full and meaningful life.
