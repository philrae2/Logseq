	- Chapter 1 - The Words Under the Words
		- > People don't choose between things, they choose between descriptions of thingsâ€”[[Daniel Kahneman]]
		- [[Framing]] is the mechanics of how our choice of words influence and change the decision people make.
			- For example more people will decide to have surgery if they are told that the "survival rate is 90%" than if they are told that the "mortality rate is 10%".
			- The next time you write an email, tell a story, or send someone a text, think about the words under the words in the message you hope to communicate.
			- **Be aware of the words under your words is especially when crafting headings. Headings gives you the opportunity to frame an issue and plant ideas even before the reader gets to the main text.**
		- The words you choose can change the decisions people make.
			- Example of a before and after about a court case of  pharmacist who may lose unemployment benefits:
				- > Given that Mr. Louis maintained a good-faith belief that he could more rapidly serve patients by utilizing a pharmacistâ€™s password, he was not willfully and wantonly disregarding his employerâ€™s interest and thus should not be disqualified from unemployment benefits.
				- > Mr. Louisâ€™s good-faith effort to help the pharmacy more quickly serve its patients does not rise to the level of misconduct required to disqualify him from unemployment benefits.
			- ^^People don't choose between things, they choose between descriptions of things.^^
			- > For moral behaviors, nouns work better than verbs. To get 3 to 6 year-olds to help with a task, rather than inviting them 'to help', it was 22 to 29 percent more effective to encourage them to be 'a helper.'
