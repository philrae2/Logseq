- Notes:
	 - Our overconfidence can lead us to deflect personality responsibility and ownership of a poor decision to others or external factors outside our control, when in reality we are the owners of our failures.
		 - When we make the [[Fundamental Attribution Error]] we miss the opportunity for learning and growth from our mistakes

	 - We miss the opportunity to reflect and evaluate our decision making skills when we don't see the negative outcomes or don't attribute them to ourselves
