- [[Single Loop Learning]]
	 - The first time you make a decision, follow a rule or framework, or aim for a goal, that is single loop learning. 

	 - If we continue using the same decision making methods or processes all the time without improving ourselves and reflecting our processes then we are applying single loop learning.

- [[Double Loop Learning]]
	 - Learning that is improved throughout the process based on the feedback received through the course of learning. 

	 - Requires [[reflection]] of the learning methods and the learning experiences in order to improve

	 - Learn and reflection from failures and successes
