			- 3. Identify the steps/tools used in this situation
			- 4. Imagine it’s the day after that period of time and you didn’t achieve the goal, or the decision worked out poorly. Looking back from that imagined point in the future, list up to five reasons why you failed due to your own decisions and actions or those of your team. Include percentage of likelihood
			- 5. List up to five reasons why you failed due to things outside your control.
			- 6. If you’re doing this as a team exercise, have each member do steps (4) and (5) independently, prior to a group discussion of reasons.

	- In advance of the [[decision]] you can use the output of the [[premortem]] and [[backcasting]] to consider the following actions:
		- 1. Modify your decision to increase the chances of the good stuff happening and decrease the chances of the bad stuff happening
		- 2. Planning how you'll react to future outcomes, so they don't take you by surprise
		- 3. Looking for ways to [[mitigate]] the impact of bad outcomes if they occur
	- ^^The information learned from backcasting and premortem exercises allows you to identify decision and actions that will help you gain ground toward your goal, as well as decisions that will hinder your progress.^^
	- [[category decisions]] - when you identify a category of poor decisions that will be hard to spot except in the aggregate, you can decide to in advance what options you can and cannot choose that fall within that category e.g., being a vegan
		- Making a category decision shields you from a series of decisions that are all vulnerable to your worst impulses in the moment
