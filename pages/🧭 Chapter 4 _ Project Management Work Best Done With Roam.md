title: ðŸ§­ Chapter 4 | Project Management Work Best Done With Roam
---

- > - Roam works best with project management work that requires syntheses based on input information
- In most cases, using your usual work collaboration software is better than teaching your team to use Roam
- Roam does not make sense for working with numbers and collaborating with teammates that don't use Roam

- Software like Asana, Trello and Basecamp are many times called **project management software**. It is more accurate to call them **project teamwork software**. They mainly help in coordinating tasks and team communication. As you will see in the upcoming chapters, project management is much more than assigning, tracking and collaborating on tasks.
	 - Here is a list of project management work categorized by the [PMBOK](((3bf5ada8-53c9-4af0-aa78-2f6d1f395507)))'s project management knowledge areas. I placed color-coded hashtags of the software or software categories I would use for each of these work packages.

- As of the writing of this block, I have been using Roam to manage [[Project Accessible Genomics]] and some other smaller projects for more than a year. Based on that experience, here are my thoughts on the following:
	 - Project work best done in Roam

	 - Project work better done in other software

	 - Project work that does not make sense to do in Roam.

- Project management work best done with Roam
	 - > The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), the Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS), the project charter, designing serendipity, lists, the team plan, the project management plan

	 - Roam is an upgrade for project management work that requires syntheses based on input information.
		 - For instance, Roam is the best tool I've used for scope identification using the **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**. You will experience creating this for your chosen project in [[ðŸ§° Chapter 5 | The Heart of Project Management: The WBS]]. With the inputs of interview notes, journal articles, or your own experience, you will create the structured and (eventually) comprehensive to-do list that is the WBS. In [[ðŸ§° Chapter 8 | How to Not Fail: The RBS and The Risk Register]] we will do the same for the **Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)**.
			 - This process is similar to the academic workflow of creating your summary of a topic from multiple sources or creating a piece of written work from various notes. In the past, we would do this by alt-tabbing and copy-pasting across windows. With Roam, we can option/alt-drag blocks between the main panel and the right sidebar. Or at the very least write anew with your source notes in the sidebar, easily collapsed and moved around to your desired order.

	 - Other kinds of project management work that work well with Roam are those that use templates or guides or make use of outputs from other project management tools. For instance:
		 - We can create templates for our [Project Charter]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 6 | Aligning Your Stakeholders, Your Team and Your Future Selves: The Project Charter]]) or the processes for [Designing Serendipity]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 9 | Designing Serendipity: How to Systematically Get Lucky]]).

		 - The output of creating a **Risk Register** are risk response tasks that should be added to the WBS. You can keep the contexts of your additions to the WBS with block references. Option/alt-dragging or using the right-click menu for block references between the main panel and the sidebar is the easiest way I've experienced in doing this work.

	 - Roam is also the best tool I've used for running multiple projects concurrently and for project-driven productivity.
		 - In the past, projects information were stored in various folders, applications, and workspaces within applications. Information across project are now all in Roam.

		 - The commanding heights of project management is seamlessly translated to the daily execution in Roam, since I do both project management and task management in it. I share how I do this in [[ðŸ§° Chapter 12: Project-driven Stallion\Rider Productivity]].

- Project management work which could be done with Roam but is better done with some other software
	 - > stakeholder analysis, the communications plan, the risk register, project schedule

	 - Roam is an alien language to those who don't use it. It is easier for me to use other software that my teammates and my other stakeholders understand, than to introduce them to Roam.
		 - For instance, the spreadsheet is almost a universal language today. I could do [stakeholder analysis and the communications plan]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 7 | Get Support, Get Work Done and Get Lucky: Stakeholder Communications]]), the [project schedule]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 10 | Schedule Management = Focus Management]]) and the [risk register]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 8 | How to Not Fail: The RBS and The Risk Register]]) in Roam. If I need to present these documents to my team or to my other stakeholders, I do them in spreadsheets.

- Project management work which doesn't make sense to do in Roam
	 - > working with numbers, project communications, collaborating with people who don't use Roam

	 - Project cost management should be done in a spreadsheet or some specialized cost management software.

	 - Project communications should be designed based on what your teammates and other stakeholders are already using. For most teams, that is not Roam.

	 - Project collaboration and task management is best done with tools your team is familiar with and are designed for collaboration around tasks (eg, Asana, Basecamp, ClickUp, Monday, Notion, Trello).

- > Project management entails both thinking and doing. **Roam is a tool for thought, and it can be our headquarters for the thinking part of project management.**
- Creative thought: envisioning the projectâ€”both the destination and how to get there
- Analytical thought: breaking the project down to its atomic components
- Strategic thought: programming our attention relative to the importance of these components

This rBook is about how to operate your headquarters.

	 - The heart of project management is doing the work needed to complete the project. How do we identify this work? How do we allot attention relative to the importance of work? How do we track the completion of this work? We will answer these questions in the next chapter: [[ðŸ§° Chapter 5 | The Heart of Project Management: The WBS]]
