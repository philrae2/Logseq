	- “The largest early users of Kubernetes were getting bills for millions a month from Google but couldn’t accurately tell where they were spending the money because of the complexities of the Kubernetes scheduler and the pricing structure of the cloud services the platform helps manage,” Brown says. “So engineers had no idea how to tune or optimize their infrastructure. As a result, there was a huge opportunity to improve efficiency.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17chj8k4pp1c75p6bkw1mpt))

	- He found ways to stay embedded in the Kubernetes ecosystem — attending conferences, [maintaining relationships with people in the industry](https://review.firstround.com/reach-out-stay-in-touch-and-deepen-your-connections-with-this-essential-networking-advice) and staying tuned in to online conversations — and through these channels, continued to hear the same chorus of complaints from the teams that used Kubernetes. ”It was that question around pricing again, at all levels of the company. Engineering couldn't answer it, finance couldn't answer it, leadership couldn't answer it. I heard that same feedback in so many different forms.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17cq5k75nq6xc4qrqpx2m2p))

	- **VALIDATING THE IDEA**
	  
	  With an idea on paper, Brown and Tripathy set out to validate two things: first, that the problem space was actually as large and urgent as they were assuming. And, second, that the solution they had in mind was the right one to solve their stated problem.
	  
	  The validation phase is where many founders stumble. People tend to get overly invested in their initial idea, making it difficult to change course or iterate as they go. Brown and Tripathy wanted to find ways to avoid falling into this trap.
	  
	  “It was really important for us to give ourselves the mental freedom to say, no, sorry, we've got this wrong,” Brown says.
	  
	  We wanted to give ourselves the ability to be wrong and fail and learn something new and be comfortable with changing directions — as opposed to committing everything we have to make this particular path work.
	  
	  Rather than investing a ton of resources upfront or being mentally married to their idea, they started with a less permanent and much more contained scope — or what they referred to as a project-oriented mindset. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17cttmt53aebbmp24qzdf8d))
	- **A true MVP**
	  
	  To truly adhere to a project-oriented mindset, Brown and Tripathy decided to get an MVP out to users as fast as possible so that they had something tangible to react to. “We built an [MVP](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/8670-cluster-cost-utilization-metrics/) literally over a weekend. It was built using another technology by the name of Grafana, which today is a really big observability platform. It had very little code written but was essentially a dashboard that could show you different Kubernetes cost trends and dimensions,” Brown says.
	  
	  Along with the MVP, they published a [Medium](https://medium.com/kubecost/effectively-managing-kubernetes-with-cost-monitoring-96b54464e419) post to explain why they were launching this open-source project. In a matter of days, over 150 people had engaged with the product. This was enough of a positive signal for the co-founders to go out and start talking to potential users.
	  
	  The benefit of this accelerated approach was that — since they didn’t spend weeks or months building, tinkering and fine-tuning their MVP — they could get their most important questions answered without being at risk of having the sunk cost fallacy influence their decisions.

		- **Note**: This is an example of a pretotype to help validate the MVP.
	- We were focused on answering questions like, what is the problem? Do people care? Are people willing to engage? We didn’t need 120 features to answer those. And sometimes that means being comfortable having a suboptimal solution for the sake of validating a hypothesis in the short term.

	- **Strong customer pull**
	  
	  Brown and Tripathy wanted to deeply understand the pain points of their potential users — and make sure their solution was aligned. So they reached out to hundreds of teams that used Kubernetes, both at startups and larger companies, to hear what they had to say.
	  
	  This is where many founders let their optimism bias creep in. It’s easy to [misinterpret someone’s polite response as a signal of validation](https://review.firstround.com/a-ux-research-crash-course-for-founders-customer-discovery-tips-from-zoom-zapier-and-dropbox), which could lead you down the wrong path. To combat this, it’s critical to look for undeniably strong signals during your conversations.
	  
	  For instance, when talking to potential customers, their eyes should light up. They should be engaged in the conversation and ready to pull their wallets on the spot to pay for your solution. In short, **there should be no space for doubt when it comes to validating your problem or solution through customer conversations.**
	  
	  Thankfully, that’s exactly the type of response Brown and Tripathy got when they unfurled their startup idea. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17d2ms8x8x2mtvspkmmbb52))
	- Teams weren't just saying that they were struggling with cost visibility — they were struggling in a way that they were willing to go try some totally unproven software. A bunch of them were willing to install our MVP and were already making feature requests. It just felt like we were being pulled in by these people, rather than us pushing our solution onto them.
	  
	  In total, the co-founders spent two months interviewing about 120 teams. Along the way, they used these conversations to inform, tweak and fine-tune the shape of their solution. “At that point, we said, ‘OK, there's enough here to where we want to really start thinking seriously about what a real product would look like.’” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h17d5qwn7a27kn2g7wqszemq))
