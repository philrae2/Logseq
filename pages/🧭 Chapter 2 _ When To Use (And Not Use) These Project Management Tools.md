title: ðŸ§­ Chapter 2 | When To Use (And Not Use) These Project Management Tools
---

- > - Project management tools are for projects that require expansive and complex work
- If a project requires mostly deep work, you may need to focus on that craft instead of project management
- A task management system might be more appropriate for small and simple projects
- Exploratory projects have parts which could use project management

- [[Work brings ideas to reality]].
	 - Different projects require different kinds of work.
id:: 293f5d41-cbc7-450a-bf09-cf7d19d936a8
		 - Some projects require consistent and expert repetition of the same kind of workâ€”for instance, writing, coding and painting. Let's call this **deep work**.

		 - Other projects require the coordination of many kinds of work (including deep work)â€”for instance, organizing a large event, building a house and implementing a business plan. Let's call this **expansive work**.
			 - Project management is for getting expansive work done.

					 - __Notes on deep work:__
						 - __If you also need a playbook for deep work, I suggest picking one or two the following:__ #.book-recommendation
							 - __Big Magic by Liz Gilbert (this is my playbook)__

							 - __Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule by Paul Graham__

							 - __The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron__

							 - __Deep Work by Cal Newport__

							 - __The War of Art by Steven Pressfield__

						 - __Many domains have their own workflows for deep work. In the world of non-fiction writing, for instance, we have Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten (see "How to Take Smart Notes" by SÃ¶nke Ahrens). I am using a modified version of the Zettelkasten for writing this rBook.__ #.book-recommendation

- Project management is for projects with many moving parts.
	 - The more moving parts, the more project management tools you should use. "More moving parts" means more complexity in the work required to bring your idea to reality, or more constraints in how project success is defined. Examples:
		 - More project complexity:
			 - More people involved

			 - More risks

			 - Less experience in the domain

		 - More constraints in how project success is defined:
			 - The expected product has very precise specifications

			 - Tight deadline

			 - Tight budget

		 - We will revisit these ideas in the chapter on [crafting project charters]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 6 | Aligning Your Stakeholders, Your Team and Your Future Selves: The Project Charter]]) and [designing serendipity]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 9 | Designing Serendipity: How to Systematically Get Lucky]]).
			 - > As a project manager, you'd want less project complexity and a broad definition of success.

		 - Project management may be overkill for simple projects. Task management systems may be more appropriate for these. You'd also want to adjust the number of tools you use depending on the complexity of the project.

		 - __Notes on task management:__
			 - __Getting Things Done (GTD) by David Allen is one of the most commonly used task management systems.__ #.book-recommendation

			 - I present an alternative to GTD in the last chapter: [[ðŸ§° Chapter 12: Project-driven Stallion\Rider Productivity]]

- Project management can be used for exploratory projects
	 - Examples of exploratory projects:
		 - Validating business model assumptions

		 - Getting a better understanding of users to create a product

	 - Exploratory projects usually have parts which can be scoped and managed.
		 - The startup playbook I'm familiar with is Steve Blank's "Evidence-based Entrepreneurship" ("Lean Startup" is a popular variant of this). A key part of this process is conducting interviews. This part can be project managed. Another part of this process is to create a prototype. The design of this prototype will be influenced by what you discover in the interviews. If appropriate (ie, the creation of the prototype is complex and requires expansive work), you can use project management for it.

	 - The special case of software development
		 - The project management tools introduced in this rBook are from the practice of orchestrating atoms: launching new businesses, constructing buildings, organizing events. In software development, project teams orchestrate bits instead. 
			 - From the perspective of project management, the main difference is the cost of changing the material output, both in money and time.
				 - Changing business processes, buildings and events are costly. Changing software costs practically zero.
					 - To change a building you need to pay both for the civil engineer and the cement. To change a program, you pay the software engineerâ€”and that's practically it. And the changes are instantaneous.

			 - Because of this property, products of software development can be designed through iteration, more than planning, prototyping and building.
				 - Orchestrating the work of creating a product through iteration has produced a new kind of project management: Agile.
					 - Some day, someone will write an rBook on Agile methodologies in Roam. It will not be me. All the projects I've managed orchestrated atoms, not bits.

		 - Like other exploratory projects, software development has aspects that would benefit from classical project management. For instance:
			 - Capturing user needs

			 - Adhering to regulatory requirements

			 - Managing stakeholders

			 - Hiring engineers

- [[Maximize your learning]]
id:: c80446a4-b76f-4508-9ae6-92a4e261adfd
	 - **Let's maximize what we learned in this chapter**
In real life, you'd want to use the minimum project management tools to bring your ideas to reality (you are trading more work for better outcomes). For learning these tools, however, you would want to pick one project and overmanage it with all the project management tools in this rBook.
		 - 1. What are the projects you are most excited about?
			 - 

		 - 2. Which ones of these projects would benefit from project management tools?
			 - 

		 - 3. Which ones of these projects require mastery of a craft instead of mastery of project management?
			 - 

		 - 4. Which ones of these projects could be accomplished with a task management system and without project management tools?
			 - 

		 - 5. Which one among these projects would you like to manage with project management tools in order to maximize your learning?

- [[Next chapter]]
	 - Another way to look at project management: it is a set of solutions for problems project managers need to face. We will learn these problems and their solutions in the next chapter: [[ðŸ§­ Chapter 3 | 10 Project Management Problems and 10 Project Management Tools]]
