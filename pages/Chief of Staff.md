- If you find that you are simply not completing the goals you set for yourself each week, or you do so, but some or many of the tasks are energy-draining, then it is time to hire a Chief of Staff (CoS). 
  
  A CoS has become such an effective hire for the CEOs that I coach that I now require it before coaching someone. I think it's the very first hire that you should make, whether I'm coaching you or not.
  
  Not only does the CoS ensure that your actions get done, but they are also process-oriented and can run the repetitive steps required in a sound management system. They can literally run your company for you. 
  
  Mark Organ, CEO of Influitive, gives a thorough description of [CoS best practices](https://firstround.com/review/why-you-need-two-chiefs-in-the-executive-office/) in his First Round blog post. To me, the two priorities in creating a great CoS are:
- Their background
- How you train them
	- Background. The best CoS's are highly organized, excellent communicators (both written and oral), and have broad strategic business knowledge. An environment that almost always ensures these skills is several years at a top management consulting firm (Bain, BCG, and McKinsey). I am partial to Bain, as I find x-Bain consultants also have excellent financial modeling skills (akin to those that they would have learned had they worked as an associate at an investment bank). In addition, it is nice if they have 1-2 years of experience in the tech world to be familiar with current productivity tools. But this is, IMHO, a nice-to-have, not a requirement.
	- Training. The key is to give your CoS unfettered access to all the information that you receive. It would be best to have the CoS sit beside you from morning till night, with full access to your emails, calls, meetings, etc. By seeing what decisions you make, based on what information you receive, she will soon be able to think like you, and then she can truly be an extension of you (and magic will happen).
	  
	  After several weeks of observing, your CoS can start to take tasks off of your plate. Within several months, she will be able to do all the functions that don't give you energy or that you don't have the capacity to do. 
	  
	  Phil Levine at [Golden Gate Recruits](https://www.goldengaterecruits.com/about) is an excellent recruiter for this position, as he is x-Bain and has many contacts in that world.
	  
	  Another effective recruiting tool is your social media presence. This role is essentially about enthusiasm rather than specific skills. The person is making the trade of being willing to "do your laundry" in exchange for getting to watch your life. For that, they need to be a big fan of your life. And if they are, then they most likely already follow you on social media. 
	  
	  Most senior candidates are not attracted to the CoS role because they view it as an "assistant" role. And in many companies, it is. So, when recruiting, dispel this concern by showing the candidate that they will have full access to all the information that you do. And that is the single best training to become a CEO (or head of any department) that exists.
	  
	  The pushback that I get on this role is: 
	  
	  "Won't I be perceived as an asshole that thinks she's too important to talk to people directly?"
	  
	  And the answer is: *Yes. If you force people to talk to your Chief of Staff before they can talk to you. Don't ever do that. Your CoS can draft emails on your behalf. But don't ever allow them to be your gatekeeper (i.e., intercept emails and respond themselves). Communicate with people directly, especially when you need to say "no" or make a request.*
	  
	  "I am looking for the perfect person and can't find them."
	  
	  Don't wait for perfection here. Pick someone good, and have the CoS start shadowing you. It's the shadowing that is most important as no one will perform on Day 1. They need to shadow you for 30 days before they have enough context to do anything. I encourage you to start that 30-day clock as soon as possible.
	  
	  At first, the CoS role will be unattractive to many good candidates. That is because there are two types of CoS.
- One CoS is a glorified gopher. This person does not have access to the CEO's email and does not shadow her in all meetings. Instead, from Day 1, this CoS does the projects that don't fall neatly into any department. While these projects are critical to the company's success, this Chief of Staff role has no career plan. There is no clear transition to managing a team or a department, so this role turns off strong candidates. They perceive it as a dead-end.
- The other Chief of Staff has full access. They see the CEO's email, and, in the beginning, they shadow her in all meetings. In this position, the CoS sees all of the CEO's information and then quickly understands every role and function in the company. For the person in the CoS role, it is the most intense CEO training that exists. Yes, the CEO will ask their CoS to take as much off their plate as possible. At first, this will include simple admin tasks. But there are not very many of those. And this CoS will be authorized to hire whatever support staff they need (their own EA) to complete all of these tasks. That then leaves the CoS to do more significant functions over time. Many CoS in this role eventually either take over the running of a department, or even the people management of the Exec Team (i.e., running the 1-1s and team meetings), making them de facto President.
- There is no better learning and career-advancing role than CoS. It is the quickest path to a Department head or even President. The payment is doing (and then overseeing) admin work (corporate and personal). These tasks are a small CoSt to pay for the massive benefit. 
  
  Here is a good [perspective of the Chief of Staff role](https://medium.com/chiefofstaffnetwork/the-chief-of-staff-role-in-silicon-valley-182eb93e636e) from a former CoS. If you want your CoS to do the company's people management for you, choose a more senior one (i.e., 10-15 years of work experience). A more senior CoS becomes a strategic thought-partner and helps craft the product's future vision and the company.
  
  I finally received the first negative feedback on a Chief of Staff hire. The CoS had started doing 1-1s with all executive team members, who had shared their frustrations about the founder. The CoS, however, was conflict-avoidant and neither relayed the feedback to the founder nor caused the execs to give the feedback directly. The execs thought that their feedback was being delivered and became even more frustrated when they saw no action or response from the founder.
  
  When I heard this story, I said to the founder: "That sounds terrible. So, this CoS role has been a bust for you?" The founder responded: "Not at all. They have done a great job of helping me run meetings, making sure that everyone is prepared, and following up afterward. Totally worth it."

  When you hire a CoS for the first time, you will likely experience lots of relief once that person begins to take tasks off of your plate (usually within the first 60 days).  This relief will only grow as they fully onboard (3-6 months) and start to jump on bigger and bigger tasks.  At this point, they often take over the management of an ailing department (or two).  They will likely do a great job in this role, but suddenly a new (and very big) problem will arise … they are no longer shadowing you and taking as many minor (but burdensome) tasks off of your plate.  And suddenly your life will get worse.
  
  There is a very easy solution here.  Once you realize that the CoS position is a valuable one (most CEOs realize this at the 2-3 month mark), immediately ask your CoS to hire 1-2 more CoS types.  These new folks will become “Members of the Office of the CEO”.  They will shadow you in the same way that your first CoS is, and they too will be onboarded within 2-3 months.   Now, each team member will be qualified to:
- Shadow you consistently and take administrative tasks off of your plate, or
- Investigate and solve cross-department issues and/or run an ailing department
  
  They can do one or the other well, but not both.  If your first CoS wants to go run a department, she can.  But not before there is another “Member of the Office of the CEO” ready to take her place as your CoS.
  
  When this happens, your first CoS will likely experience fear that she will no longer be as connected to you, and the trust will eventually erode.  This is just her fear talking, because once the trust is established, it lasts for a very long time.  
  
  Once you have an Office of the CEO, make sure that your CoS is regularly recruiting and onboarding more members (who report to the CoS).  These are your smokejumpers.  Don’t ever be left without 1-2 available to you.

  Francis Davidson, CEO of Sonder:
  
  "I'm a huge fan of the Chief of Staff role. Mine runs all OKRs and roadmap planning, and I ask him to do work I otherwise would do before. The latest example is that we had to collect feedback from 15+ people on a meaty set of issues we had to resolve, so he went and spoke with them and shared his notes along with recommended actions. He improves our management system and rolls out changes across the company - e.g., we want to add a new section to company goal meetings, so he'll work with each company goal owner to make sure they do it right. He has a team of 10 people who we dispatch into departments who struggle with our management system or need temp help. His team project manages high-priority cross-functional initiatives like IPO readiness. He and his team (the CEO's office) ensure that we are a well-run company and that I'm not dependent on making that happen consistently across all departments.
  
  I should also add that he was at the company five years before I made him my chief of staff, and nearly everyone on his team has been at the company for at least two years before being on his team, and all show a huge commitment to the culture and are excellent at execution."

  "I agree with Matt [about not waiting for the ideal background]. I promoted my EA to CoS. She did not have the typical GSB/HBS/McKinsey background, but we did the 30-day shadowing period, and it's been amazing, both for the company and me. It is important that you trust the person completely as you'll likely have them in every meeting you take, including comp/challenging conversations. I also like the idea of promoting from within the org."
