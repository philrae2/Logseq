- Planned Activities
	 - Improved requirements gathering process

	 - Improved or create a project health monitoring plan

	 - Improved prospective risks and opportunities process

	 - Document processes and standardize conventions

- Agile Methodology and User Expectations
	 - If we are truly agile then forcing all users to switch over to MPV or version 1 is a waterfall approach. An agile methodology would accept a phased approach with selected members who are eager and willing to work with less than 100%
		 - Is this possible? What would the transition phase look like?

	 - We need to analyze our processes and organizational structure if it supports 100% agile or a combination of waterfall and agile.
		 - Is our structure 100% fully agile as well as our expectations or is it a combination of Agile and Waterfall?
			 - If a combination what are the processes from each methodology would be helpful to adopt?
