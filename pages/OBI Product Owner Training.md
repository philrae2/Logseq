				 - POs are accountable for delivering value to the stakeholders

			 - POs provide alignment
				 - PO ensures that all aspects of business delivery by the development team is in alignment with the business value laid out by the PO, They do this by prioritizing PBI’s

					 - Example: Functionalities that clearly give value for collaboration should prioritized first over other functionalities. For example historical track changes can be prioritized first for development over reporting or nice to have functionalities as it aligns more closely to the value wanted by the stakeholders.
