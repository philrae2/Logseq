	- Kaitlin Woolley and I recently [investigated](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/-/media/faculty/ayelet-fishbach/research/motivating-personal-growth.pdf) the effect of seeking and embracing discomfort in improvisation, as well as in other areas of personal growth. Those we invited to seek discomfort achieved more: they took more risks in improvisation classes, engaged more in an expressive writing exercise, and when facing new and uncomfortable information, they opened themselves to it.
	  
	  > **What I didn’t realize was that feeling uncomfortable was a sign that the exercise was working, and that if I actively sought that uncomfortable feeling—rather than trying to avoid it—I would’ve learned more.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs38qfgcr6mw955b0hskv4v9))
	- Discomfort often serves as a signal to stop whatever you’re doing. When you experience physical pain, you stop exercising. When you feel emotional pain, you withdraw from the experience. Because we have this intuitive response, discomfort is often a bad sign for self-growth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs38qpn7hqwqczqtc9zm5tqa))
	- However, discomfort is expected when taking on new challenges. Our research suggests that seeing discomfort as a sign of progress and actually seeking it out can boost your motivation in these situations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs38r130vmgh7c3c1x1bk6mp))
	- While a sharp physical pain is often a good reason to quit what you’re doing, a moderate muscle ache is a signal you’re getting in shape. Likewise, moderate emotional discomfort is a signal that you’re developing as a person, and it often happens before you can detect the benefits of self-growth.

	- Moving beyond improvisation, we next tested whether seeking discomfort would also help people to obtain the full benefits from expressive writing. The [exercise](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00403.x) of writing about important emotional issues in your life has long been associated with improved mental and even physical health. Yet doing it is uncomfortable for most. In our study, we asked some people to feel awkward and uncomfortable as they write, telling them that feeling uncomfortable was a sign that the writing task is working. Other people were only asked to write. We found that when people sought to feel uncomfortable, they reported growing emotionally, developing skills, and ultimately, they were more interested in repeating the writing task in the future.

	- Seeking discomfort also helped people open themselves to new information. Whether it was information about gun violence, the health crisis, or the viewpoints of those across the political divide, people who embraced discomfort were willing to engage with unwelcome information more.
