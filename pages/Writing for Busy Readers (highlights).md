	- Effective writing makes life easier, more pleasant, and more productive both for the writer and for the reader ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hby13ct5269w0b9x1hvdp3ym))
	- *Effective writing has a well-defined purpose*. Writing is how you share ideas that are important to you. It is also how you convince other people to do what you want them to do, whether that means reading a memo, picking the restaurant where you‚Äôll have lunch, or signing up to volunteer at a community event. Effective writing gets through to the reader, even the busy reader whose own goal may be to stop reading and move on as quickly as possible. If you lose your reader, it‚Äôs not their fault; it is your job as the writer to capture their attention and keep them engaged. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hby13kxerk35qn6sbgqxzndq))
	- *Effective writing helps the writer as well as the reader*. Most of us write for practical reasons dozens, maybe hundreds, of times each week. So we must be good at it, right? Turns out, we‚Äôre far worse at practical writing than we think we are. Too often, our messages go unanswered. We get late or incomplete responses. Seemingly simple exchanges become complicated and confusing. The principles of effective writing help you get your point across more clearly and quickly so that things happen when you want them to. Being clear with your words also forces you to be clear in your own thinking. It brings your ideas and goals into sharper focus. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hby141jfsznf1g0sgjar671b))
	- *Effective writing is not the same as beautiful writing*. Expressive, literary writing is a time-honored craft, but a highly subjective one that can take a lifetime to master. It is often consumed as a form of recreation by people who have the time and who have already decided to set aside other tasks so that they can indulge themselves in their reading. Often, beautiful writing is intentionally demanding and multilayered. Effective writing, on the other hand, is a skill that anyone can master, and it has a very specific goal: clearly convey specific information to busy people and make it easy for them to understand and respond. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hby14eepsef5psfj8p9b40fm))
	- *There is a rigorous science underlying the rules of effective writing.* We can argue endlessly about what kind of writing is most beautiful, but effective writing is not so subjective. There are well-defined strategies, based on the science of human cognition, that offer guidance on how to be more effective writers. We have looked at hundreds of scientific studies and conducted our own research to see what works. We also draw lessons from our two careers as writers and communicators. This book codifies all of that knowledge into a set of principles designed to be applicable to all forms of practical communication. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hby15vgh1m27d0720cv6z5e1))
	- *Effective writing is read in a context*. Our six principles of effective writing (and the rules of application associated with each of them) can help anyone become a more effective writer and communicate more clearly with a busy reader. The underlying science is the same in every situation. How to put the principles into action will depend heavily on context, however. Each writer has a different voice and life experience; each reader has different expectations, assumptions, and biases. In each section of the book we will discuss the contextual considerations that we all face in the real world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hby1c823vyk6sfsrdc05ykrx))
	- Lengthy emails in today‚Äôs work environment [are] disrespectful of the reader. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hby1gs51rv7z2fkt9s3nbk3y))
	- To be an effective writer, we need to remember that our readers experience the scarcity of time every bit as acutely as we do. Their distractions influence both what they read and how they read it. To understand how to write for a busy reader, therefore, we need to understand what goes on inside a busy brain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hby1nzcewb0v4rgnp1wdwtzn))

	- The limited capacity of our busy brains has three implications, each of which profoundly influences how we interact with the world around us, including what and how we read:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   We cannot notice or process everything in front of us.
	    
	  ‚Ä¢   We can exhaust our focus over time, often in less time than we think.
	    
	  ‚Ä¢   We struggle focusing on multiple things at one time, but we still try. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmhhhnfds1jmrjd4bc7v348))
	- *Shortcut #1:* We most quickly notice elements that have a strong visual contrast with their surroundings. See for yourself. What do you notice first in the modified version of the image below?
	  
	  ![](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/reader/parsed_document_assets/91930651/x002_Writing_9780593187487_tx_r1_2.jpg-002_Writin_d2xNO78.jpg) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmhkbzjpw6djcd0yrz9v6nq))
	- *Shortcut #2:* Our selective attention can be intentionally and purposefully directed. Return to the first picture on [this page](private://read/01har710tksw2q8rmheb8gedbk#image_page_19), and this time try to find the *person sitting on the bench*. You probably didn‚Äôt randomly cast your gaze back and forth across the image. Most likely, you started by scanning the walkway area for benches and then easily found the bench that has a person sitting on it. If you look really closely, you can see that they have a tiny dog on a leash with them, too. When we look for something specific, our attention system helps us efficiently and quickly find it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmhm4q7fc330dth2anc6r1j))
	- However, in the process of noticing some elements, we miss others‚Äîoften without realizing it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmhmg7n1bef433nc5waphb0))
	- Brain research has revealed that when you notice and examine one item in a visual scene, the brain actively suppresses noticing other items that are also present.[[14]](private://read/01har710tksw2q8rmheb8gedbk#EndnoteNumber17) As a result, we often don‚Äôt notice the things we‚Äôre not looking for. The brain‚Äôs natural tendency to zero in on relevant information is an important fact for effective writing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmhmps4bsdfw497g7gja1zk))
	- Every time a reader encounters a written communication‚Äîeven something as short as an email, a text, a Slack message, or a social media post‚Äîthey go through a four-stage process:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   First, they must decide whether to engage with it at all.
	    
	  ‚Ä¢   Second, if they decide to engage, they then must decide when to engage. Sometimes the decision to engage leads to a decision to engage later.
	    
	  ‚Ä¢   Third, once they do engage, they must decide how much time and attention to allocate to reading the message.
	    
	  ‚Ä¢   Fourth, if they read something that requires a response, they must decide whether to respond or react ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmhpd7czjmz383mg35tj579))
	- Effective writing is about transferring key information from the writer to the reader. Getting the busy reader to engage and react is only part of the process. You also have to know, very clearly, what it is you are trying to achieve with your writing. What do you want the reader to understand? How do you want the reader to respond? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmht7err44y5tt4y8sbfgk4))
	- For simplicity, you can pose the most essential version of these questions to yourself: If your reader is going to spend just five seconds on your message, *what is the most important information you want them to come away with?* If you don‚Äôt know your goals as a writer, it‚Äôs impossible to effectively convey them to readers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmhtaf04w9gzr1xs0efdynm))
	- But effective writing requires taking the revision process quite a bit further than that. Starting with an initial draft, effective writers will revise, and revise again, until we understand our own goals. We did so repeatedly in the course of writing this book. More surprising, perhaps, we routinely revise and rewrite our emails, memos, and even text messages. That behavior might seem like overkill, but the rewards are significant. Once you get into the habit of goal-focused revision, you will notice that your own ideas become clearer, and that the things you write are more likely to achieve the impact you were aiming for. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmhv4zkeg53n6br2b4b6tm8))
	- Not sure how to be an effective rewriter? On each revision, continually ask yourself these two essential questions: ‚ÄúWhat is the most important information I want my readers to understand?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow do I make it easier for my readers to understand it?‚Äù Keep in mind that you cannot achieve your goals as a writer if you are unclear on what those goals are! Once you know the answer, you are ready to begin the process of ensuring that your writing accomplishes those goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmhv8h7q4x19h092ynyn13m))
	- First Principle: Less Is More ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmhvphhmdkynph5pxx1bwjk))
	- First and foremost, more writing takes more time to read. The average American adult takes in about 240 words per minute when reading nonfiction‚Äîjust four words per second.[[1]](private://read/01har710tksw2q8rmheb8gedbk#EndnoteNumber49) Although the time required to read an additional few words or sentences can seem trivial, it quickly adds up. More writing also requires more concentration. Both academic research and our own personal observations confirm that readers are more likely to read messages that include fewer words, ideas, and requests. In fact, modern readers have developed a shorthand expression for how they feel about overwhelmingly verbose writing. ‚ÄúTL;DR‚Äù has become a common, sarcastic‚Äîand *short*‚Äîway to note that something is ‚Äútoo long; [so I] didn‚Äôt read.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmhwcsb541502kgwwcgwnme))
	- Writing concisely requires a ruthless willingness to cut unnecessary words, sentences, paragraphs, and ideas. It can be hard to delete the words that you spent time crafting‚Äîto ‚Äúmurder your darlings,‚Äù as advised in the classic lectures compiled in *On the Art of Writing.*[[9]](private://read/01har710tksw2q8rmheb8gedbk#EndnoteNumber57) But doing so increases the chances that your audience will read what you write. Nancy Gibbs, former editor in chief of *Time* magazine, would tell her staff that every word has to earn its place in a sentence, every sentence has to earn its place in a paragraph, and every idea has to earn its place in a text.[[10]](private://read/01har710tksw2q8rmheb8gedbk#EndnoteNumber58) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmhz3ezexz42a2nvf5zpdjw))
	- Although concise messages demonstrably outperform wordy messages, most people wrongly predict that wordier messages will be more effective.[[11]](private://read/01har710tksw2q8rmheb8gedbk#EndnoteNumber59) This contradiction is driven, in part, by a fundamental tension in many types of common writing. We want to communicate with the reader precisely but also completely. We want the reader to engage and react, but we also want the reader to be aware of us as a writer with nuance, emotion, and style. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmhzfk229etgajeaetef01k))
	- Why would a school district intentionally send a ‚Äúless effective‚Äù message to parents? Because, in this case, doing so helped them accomplish a more important purpose than getting responses to a school survey. Their paramount goal was rebuilding warm relationships with parents after a tumultuous year of remote schooling. Getting parents to complete the survey was a secondary goal. After weighing these priorities, the school district decided that the longer message came across as more emotional and human. It did more to serve their overall goals, even if it yielded fewer survey responses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmj031t1pyt0adchkcw1p60))
	- The bottom line is that effective writing needs to be appropriate to the context of the communication. We can provide the guidelines, but you have to make the informed decisions about how to balance your desire to include more words, ideas, and requests with the many constraints facing a busy reader. We do *not* recommend that writers categorically use the shortest possible messages. Rather, we recommend cutting all that can be cut, and no more, to suit your goals. Different contexts may require different considerations. But more often than people think, less is more when it comes to writing for busy people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmj08d6k1w2qphvhs9p0g4p))
	- THE RULES OF ‚ÄúLESS IS MORE‚ÄùRule 1: Use Fewer Words ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmj0jjtt5y5by71zam82n43))
	- Rule 2: Include Fewer Ideas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmj35pkk4kc8qd11ehke08c))
	- Concise writing is not just about limiting the total word count. It is also about limiting the number of distinct ideas in a message ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmj3cvhvbfyes9b75t9z32w))
	- Rule 3: Make Fewer Requests ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmj5hgnb4se4hvs9fv2rvqh))
	- Deleting the precious words and ideas we‚Äôve written can be difficult, but effective practical writing requires a third type of self-restraint that can be the most challenging of all: asking for less. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmj64wkc90be0k8h01d4xeq))
	- Second Principle: Make Reading Easy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmj9ka2cenxfaat41k8fv2p))
	- Shorter and more common words are inherently easier to read, as are shorter and simpler sentences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmjpenwmh75nwpx8r22hkx0))
	- READABLE WRITING IS CLEAR
	  
	  It‚Äôs important to recognize that writing fewer words does not necessarily make writing easier to understand ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmjqjgacveeqwfr35wh1q28))
	- Given two messages with the same number of words, it takes less time and effort to read the one that is written using simpler words.[[11](private://read/01har710tksw2q8rmheb8gedbk#EndnoteNumber76) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmjqvphnp0fdebsz4h74waz))
	- THE RULES OF READABLE WRITINGRule 1: Use Short and Common Words ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmjs5mvnkhttqwheah2q03r))
	- In general, words with fewer syllables and words that are more commonly used can be read more easily and quickly ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmjtztpf56jbk9b2hsrdef1))
	- Occasionally, though, length and commonness do not line up. The word *erudite* has fewer syllables than the word *knowledgeable*, but *knowledgeable* is five times as common. In this case, we would lean toward selecting the more common word since more readers will know what it means, even if it is longer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmjvpq5r78skz64f2vfj26h))
	- Some research suggests that writers who use simpler words actually appear *more* intelligent than those who use less simple ones. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmjwx9ng4th74r6dzmee4ma))
	- When you are balancing the trade-offs between readability and using longer, less common but (potentially) more precise words, ask yourself two questions. First, how valuable are the subtle differences in word meaning for conveying the essence of the sentence? Second, is the additional meaning conveyed by the harder-to-read word worth the costs of fewer readers engaging and understanding it and the increased effort required by those who do? Different contexts will call for different solutions, but writers should always weigh the costs they impose on their busy readers. Those five-dollar words may not be worth the cost. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmjxbdat7h721wnkg387bfw))
	- Rule 2: Write Straightforward Sentences ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmjxm12hys93r78zsb6n9x1))
	- Straightforward sentences order relevant words and phrases next to each other, such that they readily make sense after the previous words and phrases. That is, a straightforward sentence doesn‚Äôt require readers to jump around. Keeping things tight and orderly increases the likelihood readers will understand the full meaning of the sentence in just one pass, decreasing the chance they quit reading altogether. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmkh8r7zwb30c7760jnytzm))
	- Rule 3: Write Shorter Sentences ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmkgppt61eprgrqz81m5rs4))
	- One reason why short sentences are easier to read than longer ones may be that the longer sentences often incorporate more than one idea. Readers are taught to make sense of each sentence before moving on to the next. Eye-tracking studies can capture this process in action. Readers‚Äô eyes pause when they reach an end-of-sentence period, seemingly to process and integrate the sentence.[[37]](private://read/01har710tksw2q8rmheb8gedbk#EndnoteNumber102) The period at the end of a sentence indicates that a certain unified concept is now complete. Readers then take a brief pause, process, and make sure they understand the completed sentence before moving on. Longer sentences require readers to hold more content in their minds before they process the full sentence‚Äîa more demanding cognitive task, especially if the sentence contains multiple independent ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmkhzz5p2z95jv6tg2pmr86))
	- Third Principle: Design for Easy Navigation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmkpfsqkjyzrd46f49fkwj5))
	- One of the key aspects of writing for busy people is not strictly about writing at all. It is about *design*‚Äîspecifically, designing the written content to be easy to navigate. When readers look at your message, they should immediately be able to grasp its purpose, main points, and structure. The way you place your words should help them quickly find the pieces they want to engage with, and the pieces they prefer to skip or skim. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmkpw7f40j4tmff94xhb1nq))
	- THE RULES OF WELL-DESIGNED WRITINGRule 1: Make Key Information Immediately Visible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmkqw3hy5rxdt4xejnwwhyp))
	- Making the most important information immediately clear to the reader requires going back to basics and being equally clear about your own goals as a writer‚Äîthis time with an added emphasis on visual presentation. Ask yourself again, ‚ÄúWhat do I want my readers to take away from this?‚Äù If your primary goal is for readers to attend a city council meeting, the meeting details and the request to attend should be the most obvious elements. But if you have multiple competing goals for a message, it can be challenging to figure out what the *key* information is that you want to highlight. In that case, you will have to figure out the hierarchy of your goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmkw3c78et4bqsr77by2azd))
	- A good rule of thumb, regardless of the specific type of communication, is to put the most important information in the places where busy readers most likely expect to find it. The US Army has codified this advice with a guideline that writers should place the *bottom line up front* (BLUF).[[1]](private://read/01har710tksw2q8rmheb8gedbk#EndnoteNumber105) BLUF is an official army policy instructing writers to put the key information at the beginning of written communications. That way, readers in the army automatically know where to find the purpose of a communication ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmkzt2zhmrcxjr7ftwatspf))
	- Rule 2: Separate Distinct Ideas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmm349q4cg3m113vmwr0kqf))
	- Another way to help busy readers orient themselves quickly in the landscape of your writing is to separate distinct topics. Putting space between them makes it easier for the reader to skim and to scan for key information. A simple first step is to give each distinct topic its own paragraph, since a new paragraph visually signals a new set of ideas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmm3e9v8ed3xb4hkj67k298))
	- One of the most visually clear ways to signal to readers that ideas are distinct is to list each one with a bullet point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmm3nf5h5hmxd4ewwbzvka2))
	- Rule 3: Place Related Ideas Together ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmm49r2aj3q2frkqnhpxkkz))
	- In addition to visually separating *distinct* ideas, placing *related* ideas next to each other (or as close as possible) can make it easier for readers to quickly grasp key information. The *Visually Separated* version of the Danish study described above follows this rule as well. Each distinct bullet point is related to one requirement for receiving unemployment benefits. Parsing them into separate bullets helps readers understand that they are individual requirements; keeping them next to each other helps readers understand that they are all related ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmm4nm41y40y5v6s8zqatzw))
	- Rule 4: Order Ideas by Priority ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmm6dgct2wjwewvhxawvm52))
	- Rule 5: Include Headings ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmm7nhn9qgvwr4cw5k7g7d8))
	- You know exactly what we are about to discuss in this next section, right? It‚Äôs hard to miss, since we just told you right above‚Äîin larger type, no less. Headings help busy readers scan a message and decide which parts they want to zoom in on, much the same way state names and boundaries do on a map of the US. Some common types of practical writing, such as text messages, don‚Äôt have a place for headlines. But plenty of others do: emails, memos, sticky notes, to-do lists, and so on. Even tweets, Slack messages, and Facebook posts can begin with a few capitalized words that set up the idea to follow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmm7y2n9fwn259zrp7jvk6y))
	- Rule 6: Consider Using Visuals ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmm9r64myzjw7czhx12tsnk))
	- Effective writing, by definition, relies on words, sentences, and paragraphs to convey ideas. But effective *communication* doesn‚Äôt have to abide by that constraint. As editor in chief of *Time* magazine, Nancy Gibbs would often write a note to her staff in the margins of articles she was editing: ‚ÄúIs this best conveyed with words?‚Äù Despite being a masterful writer, she knew that words aren‚Äôt always best for quickly and efficiently delivering information to busy readers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmma2r52yfhrdt1hms2jsfr))
	- Line graphs and bar graphs are simple, effective tools for conveying quantitative information, such as measurement or performance trends. Infographics can help convey nonquantitative information, such as the steps required to assemble a piece of furniture. Effective graphics don‚Äôt have to consolidate all relevant information into a single graph or image. Rather, they can serve to simplify communication. For a deep and inspiring discussion of ways to share ideas graphically, we recommend starting with Edward Tufte‚Äôs classic book *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmmb174j418c3jv3qt1078d))
	- Even simple tables that arrange words and numbers within a framework can convey complex ideas much more clearly than can words alone. The advice to use these types of visuals when possible is part of the Federal Plain Language Guidelines, the set of rules designed to make sure that US government documents are comprehensible to the general public ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmmbfmqx6303r9tbxrx2cmp))
	- The following example is taken directly from those guidelines:[[7]](private://read/01har710tksw2q8rmheb8gedbk#EndnoteNumber111)

	- Fourth Principle: Use Enough Formatting but No More ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmmd9f37qegqn2qsk6j0ttr))
	- THE RULES OF EFFECTIVE FORMATTINGRule 1: Match Formatting to Readers‚Äô Expectations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmmmb9w8saxnb5jacg20rd4))
- New highlights added [[2023-10-19]] at 7:32 PM
	- Rule 2: Highlight, **Bold**, or Underline the Most Important Ideas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcnmp69v9wd0qt5cdnx66zhj))
	- Since the vast majority of people interpret highlighted, bolded, and underlined text as identifying what the writer thinks is most important, these tools are useful for drawing readers‚Äô attention to critical portions of the text. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcnmpa1netrk7zfw2g50jb0b))
	- Because these formatting types are so effective, they can have an important unintended consequence: They will easily draw readers‚Äô attention away from everything else. In an earlier, 2021 study, we asked nearly one thousand people to read the same five-paragraph passage.[[10]](private://read/01har710tksw2q8rmheb8gedbk#EndnoteNumber122) In the middle of the fourth paragraph, we instructed them to select a specific response option to a later survey question to earn a bonus equal to half of their compensation for participating in the study. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcnmpjj1qc5j40204h36t659))
	- The key message here is that highlighting, bolding, and underlining involve trade-offs: They increase the likelihood that readers read the formatted words, but they can decrease the reading of everything else. Used well, these tools can help readers locate and understand the most important information. But used ineffectively, they can undermine writers‚Äô goals. As with all aspects of effective writing, you need to know your reader and you need to know your goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcnmq1n0787477thvw146wt8))
	- Rule 3: Limit Your Formatting ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcnmq3tsznmrhrhpcn2zabjt))
	- The broad takeaway is to avoid formatting multiple items when you particularly want your reader to focus on just one. Sometimes you really do want the reader to focus on more than one place, however. We are often asked, ‚ÄúWhat should I do if I have three (or more) important items that all need to be addressed in the same message?‚Äù Our first response tends to be asking whether all the information genuinely is important. If the answer is yes, we then ask whether all the information needs to be included in a single message. If the answer is yes again, the writer now has to be extremely judicious in applying formatting. (We discuss this issue in greater detail in chapter 10.)

	- When readers regard a topic as personally relevant, they will exert more effort to understand it, read more deeply, and recall more content. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcnmte6z4c78y6qk6gbf8z4r))
	- A good shorthand for writers who are working on practical communications is: ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù Try to picture the recipient of your message and consider what would make that person care about what you are saying. An additional factor to consider is not only why the reader should care but why the reader should care *now*‚Äîthat is, the timeliness of the message. We‚Äôll talk more about this in chapter 10.

	- Accurately predicting *what* ideas readers will care about is difficult, so another useful strategy is to target your message by emphasizing *which* readers should care. If a message seems generic and impersonal, readers may broadly presume that it is not relevant and ignore it. In that case, the specific readers for whom the message is relevant might miss out on valuable information. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcnmzrn9bghmqwkypsy44e65))
	- Being explicit about your intended audience is especially pertinent in mass communications that are difficult to target to specific populations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcnn04vs7nm0yk85m17yyzk9))
	- By tailoring the title toward those readers who should care about the message, the *Reader‚Äôs Perspective* title likely increases the number of relevant readers who engage with it. It also helps readers for whom the message is irrelevant to know to skip it, making it both more effective and kinder to busy readers.
