	- OBI Vision
	  collapsed:: true
		- Adopt an enterprise view
			- Instead of thinking “my contract”, “my project”, “my resources”, think  about how can we best utilize our collective resources (FTEs and  contractors) and achieve CDER’s goals. In some cases you have to be willing to give up on the short term goals in the interest of long  term goals. For example, if we believe a use case should be developed  for CDER vs a specific office then we should work with our offices and CDER PMO and reprioritize.
		- Reach out across OBI
			- We are one OBI, working for the same customer base, which is CDER. It will help you better serve your office if you able to tap into the collective intelligence and power of teams. As the recent releases have shown, we can achieve superior results by working together across teams. If you are running into a challenge our you would like to bounce some ideas reach across the teams – don’t restrict yourself to your immediate team. There is tremendous experience and expertise in OBI. Tap into it.
	- Stories
		- Leadership - Leading a team - Suitability Petitions
		  collapsed:: true
			- (Situation) Teamwork and leadership is critical to achieving the goals of OBI. The objective for our IT solutions to be reusable and scalable is an example. It requires a team effort across multiple functions of OBI to achieve. And a strong leader to drive that vision.
			- (Task) I formed  and lead a team within OBI and PMO to align with our goals sustainability with OGD and the Suitability Petitions workflow. The task for team is to first assess if the Suitability Petitions workflow can be a good candidate for reusability and scalability and second how to execute that approach.
			- (Action)  Early in the year there was no contract support so I had to create and lead an ad-hoc team to answer those questions. First I partnered with the PMO to leverage their authority and program management experience. I then added OGD product owners to the ad-hoc team to gain a better understanding of the workflows. I performed the business analysis work myself.  Then taking those high level requirements collaborated with the Deloitte contractors from the Task Tracking Tool team to help me with the feasibility assessment and asked the Task Tracking Tool leadership to clearly define their scope of eligible uses case. Regulatory vs non-regulatory workflows.
			- (Result)The result was that through my leadership and proactiveness of creating the team and teamwork we saved OBI 5 months of planning time by collecting requirements early and answering the technical feasibility question to move forward with creating a generic review tool for OGD in support of OBI's goal for sustainability.
		- Leadership - Accountability - Agile OM WER
		  collapsed:: true
			- (Situation) Keeping team members accountable for the work they need to perform can be a difficult task.  Project managers are challenged when we don't have the formal authority to leverage as a tool for keeping our team members responsible and accountable.
			- Lessons learned from the several projects I lead from beginning to release, I find clear communications and shared understanding of the goals, roles, expectations, and proposed solutions are good tools for keeping everyone accountable. Also sharing the benefits of the outcomes of achieving the goal or task is helpful motivators for team members as well.
			- (Task) I used these tools for OM WER project and one of my goals was for the team to work more agile. This goal was expected from developers and included product owners and end users.
			- (Action)  To keep our team accountable and responsible, I made sure we had a shared understanding of how to execute in an agile way by sharing examples of how the user stories should be written and how the wireframes should accompany each user story to elicit quality feedback. To help with motivation, I reminded the team that improved feedback reduces the rework that we have to do. We then communicated to our  end users and product owners at every sprint that we expected them to provide detailed feedback on wireframes and narrative of the user story. To keep our product owner and end users motivated and accountable we shared that quality feedback enabled the developers to  deliver a solution as close to their vision as possible.
			- (Result) As a result of the team being responsible and accountable, the OM WER development team is able to accommodate more stories and  functionality to our sprint because of a reduction rework. We are also taking the work done in the OM WER development along with the labeling review tool and using them as a model in the PM guide to create templates for user stories  and wireframes, improve the user story sign-off process.
		- Leadership - Tell us a time where you had to train someone through a task
		  collapsed:: true
			- (Situation) Onboarding for a new hire is challenging task. I lead and actively support the onboarding site and hold meetings for new hires to learn more about OBI, our tools and systems and the different offices we support. However for individuals, training has to also cater about the specific offices workflow we support.
			- (Task) For one of our new hires, Maria, I educated them on OBI processes and systems by also teaching her how to implement a white glove customer service support for the Office of Management. It's a good way to train a new hire on both the workflows and the OBI systems, build rapport with our clients, and get hands on experience
			- (Action) I find helpful for training is a shared understanding, for example a shared vocabulary and sharing examples are helpful for achieving the same goal. Definitely a shared view of the goal is critical to success. Also sharing the benefits of achieving the task or goal is a good motivating tool while training. So I shared with Maria past examples of how conducted a white glove service for the user fee team through emails and inviting her to how I ran a meeting. Then also shared with her the benefits of why this task was helpful she gets to learn about OBI's workflow management tools and how our clients use it and at the same time building a relationship with them. I also gave Maria multiple opportunities to take on solving client problems so she can have the opportunity to fail and learn from her mistakes. I think its important to empower individuals but also create an environment where failure is safe and a method to learning.
			- (Result) As a result of this training. Maria was able to start contributing to OBI activities quickly by triaging tickets direct from our clients, building a trusting relationship with our customers, and onboarding herself to OBI systems, processes, and tools very quickly.
		- What are 3 factors for good team work
		  collapsed:: true
			- Communication - being a good listener
				- Listening is important for informed decision making. Bad decisions are made when we don't have all the information in place before choosing an action. Listening mitigates bad decision by getting critical information from others.
				- Listening helps us get to be more educated on the problem space and paints a clearer picture of challenge or goal.
				- Problem solving is a team effort and by listening and inviting others to speak we invite them to solve the problem with us. By listening we empower people to be proactive rather than wait for us to tell them how to solve an issue.
			- A shared understanding is critical to team work.
				- A shared understanding of the goals is critical to achieving success. If we have different interpretations and prescribe different meanings to our goals or task, we'll be busy working but not achieving results if we're all moving in different directions because we don't have the same shared understanding of the problem space. We see this with the differences in how we work in "agile" environment but have different processes from team to team.
			- A safe space for conflict, failure or speaking up.
			  id:: 636b157c-1a17-478d-96a4-6bff2b25f997
				- If we leaders don't create a safe space to disagree then decision makers aren't working with all the information to make correct decisions. A safe space for all these "negative" events are crucial for growth and learning. If we don't have this space we have team members who will withhold information because it makes them look bad and results in in effective strategies and solutions.
		- What are important characteristics of a good leader
		  collapsed:: true
			- A good leader is one that empowers their team.
				- Growth comes from facing challenges and overcoming difficulties. If leaders micromanage and solve everything for their direct reports, growth and learning gains will be slower than if we let our team members identify and solve issues by their own. Empowering means raising the bar of quality of work from your team and expecting them to meet it by giving them the tools and resources to do so. Either training or through hands on experience.
			- A safe space for failure.
				- Learning from our mistakes is crucial for growth and learning. If leaders don't allow for this type of learning OBI won't grow with strategic, proactive, and empower staff. Senior leadership will be stuck running around telling people what to do instead of setting the vision and the goal of OBI. A safe space for failure creates team members who are proactive in identifying opportunities or problems and bring benefits to OBI by
			-
		- 90 Day plan
		  collapsed:: true
			- I would split the 3 months into 3 phases by understanding the organization
				- First is to understand the front line workers and the culture at this level. How is the culture affecting how the staff approaches problem solving? Are the frontline workers proactive in identifying problems and solving them? Or is the culture used to waiting for leadership to hand out orders? What are challenges, what is working well, and what we can improve on. Understand the culture of this level in terms of how they are communicating to the clients, among themselves, and up to senior leadership.
				- Second is to understand the senior leadership culture. What kinds of leadership style are in play that is impacting the relationships between senior leadership all the way down to the the frontline. What are the vision and goals of leadership? Do they make sense. What is the culture between senior leadership down to the frontline? How are the goals and objectives communicated down?
				- Third is prioritize, question where necessary, and translate the senior leadership goals into actionable projects and initiatives. As a team leader form a strategy and a plan to execute the senior management goals that aligns to the strengths and weaknesses of the team. Share the with the team the vision and desired outcomes of the goals to gain a shared understanding. Create an environment where it's okay to speak up and fail.
		- Why are you interested in this position?
		  collapsed:: true
			- To drive change in a team based approach versus driving change alone.
				- I've been actively leading and volunteering in side projects that benefit OBI, lead the onboarding website, PM guide, and holding new hire meetings to help new hires start to contribute to OBI projects more quickly.
				- Someone in this role has a great opportunity to drive change and influence the culture in OBI much more effectively because they create  a shared vision and goal with their team members.
					- For example with the new contractor transition, someone in this role can help with the transition by collaborating and leading with their team members how to execute the transition efficiently through a unified communication plan and a unified, collaborative strategy how to extract and retain vital workflow knowledge from the leaving contractor team.
					- A unified team with a shared goal is much more effective than one proactive individual contributor.
			- Slowly influence culture.
				- It's difficult to change OBI culture by one person with no formal authority or position. For example creating a safe space to speak up, the ability to question OBI decision making, or the ability to fail and make mistakes are important environments to be established for an organization to evolve and grow.
				- I've been speaking up and disagreeing with OBI decisions, and willing to make mistakes a long the way to learn. I'm not trained in the technology space but I'm been taking on the PM guide work, onboarding site management, and other projects with the PMO to accelerate my learning but also willing to fail or make mistakes or to be criticized. I'm thankful the opportunity and I think this position would allow a team leader to take on the senior management or organizational objectives and vision, transform them into actionable tasks and projects for their team to take on as learning opportunities at the same time make a safe space to make mistake, fail, but importantly learn and be challenged a long the way.
		- How do you manage conflict?
		  collapsed:: true
			- Conflict is often seen as negative, but we can reframe the event and lean towards the positive. We can see the person we have conflict with as a partner in trying to resolve the conflict. Our partner isn't the problem but the situation is.
			- We can lean on the positive by listening. Listening can help us discover what are the unfulfilled need of our our partner and express a willingness to help achieve their goal. Build rapport and trust with our conflict partners before trying to fix challenges.
			- After build trust and rapport with our partners and finding out what their needs are. Set your own boundaries and understand what your desired outcomes are. With that in place collaborate together on how to achieve both you and your partner's goals can be achieved and if there are any flexibilities to get to an agreement. For example if there's only one piece of pizza left and both you and your conversation want it, can you split the pizza by you having the crust because you like crust and the rest to your partner? Or can can you cut in evenly half? Work together to see the possible different solutions of achieving both desired outcomes.
		- What is your leadership style
		  collapsed:: true
			- Judging from the activities I am leading I would say my leadership style be a combination of teacher-coach and strategic management skills
			- I say teacher because I like to learn, collect, and pass on knowledge to my fellow OBI colleagues. I like to organize and document knowledge so we can identify our strengths, weaknesses, and find opportunities  to improve our staff. I provide information and tools that help new hires to make informed decisions and act own their best interests and sets them up for success rather than micromanaging them. I think we need to find a balance between
			- I would say also a strategist type of leadership to provide direction to the team. Meaning either drive senior management goals by transforming them into actionable tasks and strategy or finding gaps and filling them in. Including the product owner gaps I have spoken up about the gaps in OBI's own product management processes, enterprise drive approach for suitability petitions. Partnered with my supervisors on changing the dynamics between contractors and PMs to be a more collaborative environment, shifting strategy from mid-management to closer to the frontline workers.

		- Initiative - Problem solving - Filling in Knowledge gap - Onboarding
		  collapsed:: true
			- (Situation)I think discovering and solving problems outside your job description requires initiative and team building. When I first joined OBI there was no onboarding process for new hires and a lack of a knowledge management repository for OBI.  As a new hire it was difficult to understand the organization structure and also the systems and tools that OBI is responsible for.
			- (Task) OBI clearly needed to create an onboarding program and a knowledge repository if we wanted our new hires to hit the ground running and start contributing to OBI projects quickly.
			- (Action) I partnered with Tessa to  help with the problem solving and used her authority and position to request a SharePoint site to hold not only the planned onboarding website but also a new hires onboarding document. It took us about 2 months to fully complete the site and then we partnered with CIPT to help create a professional looking new hires guide.
			- (Results) The results of our team being proactive and taking this initiative is the onboarding site is a core tool to onboard OBI hires. It also includes resources for experienced PMs like recordings of OBI meetings including OBI All hands and Table Talks to preserve lessons learned and important OBI topics. The SharePoint also has a work directory where someone can easily search what each product manager or technical delivery manager is working on. As a result of this initiative and collaboration with Tessa and CIPT, the onboarding site has become an important tool for our new hires. I am really proud for all the team members that were involved to have identified a need, planned how to address it and executed it.
		- Customer focus -Tell me about a past accomplishment you are especially proud of - Orange Book
		  collapsed:: true
			- (Situation) I'm customer focused in my approach to product and project management so I'm especially proud of the client relationships I've been able to build. I'm especially proud of the relationships with the Orange Book Division fostered and nurtured under the orange book nexus transition project.
			- (Task) For the Orange Book Nexus transition we were tasked to transition the manual review of new NDA patents.
			- There were initial challenges. One was that we needed to earn and build trust with the Orange Book Division because this was their first time working with OBI and they were skeptical of our ability to deliver the IT solution. Two - we were told by OBI leadership not to create integrations between Nexus and DARRTS because DARRTS was planned for obsolescence.
			- (Solution) To solve the problem of building trust I made sure the team overcommunicated issues and risks the Orange Book Division and ensure the team owned up to our shortcomings. To solve the issue of not creating integrations with DARRTS, we had to think outside the box and partnered with the Integrity team to create a pdf parser for us to trigger project creation instead of relying on document room staff's cat and subcat processes.
			- (Results) Unfortunately, the parsing solution fails on non-electronic pdfs, so there is a 1-5% chance of missing projects on a monthly basis. I personally took responsibility for this shortcoming of the solution and conduct twice daily checks between DARRTS and Integrity to ensure we don't miss creating a project. Despite this challenge, our team earned the trust of the Orange Book Division. Because we were customer focused and took responsibility for the outcomes to ensure their needs were met. What was initially skepticism on our part to deliver has turned to the Orange Book Division wanting all their systems under OBI control including their custom database currently maintained by OIMT contractors and the OCOMM maintained Orange Book website.
		- Customer unrealistic expectations - how to solve
		  collapsed:: true
			- I actually have great relationships with my product owners and clients and strive to be customer focused. However I do think the beginning of a development process can be challenging.
			- (Situation) For OM WER Nexus transition project our product owner and end users had a  product vision in mind that had more functionality than we had the time and resources to build. There was a disconnect on what they asking us to do and what we could offer and we were having a difficult time communicating this.
			- (Task)  In the case for OM WER we did not have a shared understanding of the product definition and the development process and the amount of work to build an IT solution. This created unreasonable expectations from our product owners and end users. When we found requests unreasonable, to me it signaled a lack of shared understanding of the problem space and our task was better inform our product owners.
			- (Action) One of obvious way to come to the same definition is to work together to define the product vision of the IT solution. Often, this isn't enough because our end users don't usually know the resources and time it takes to develop a capability or functionality. This leads to frustration when we say no and they don't understand the reasoning.
			- For the OM WER project we have go the extra step of increasing our transparency with our product owners and invited them to problem solve with us. In the OM development process our product owner are part of our sprint planning and sometimes in our Capability meetings they can participate in the developers estimate the level of effort needed and the integrations and integration discussion required for each user story. Our Product Owners are hands on.
			- (Results) As a result of the transparent way of development, our product owner's became more knowledgeable of the development process and we gained a shared understanding of the product vision, development timelines and resources. Our product owner started to see for themselves why their requests are feasible or not because they're part of the team. Often OBI tends to keep our product owners away from our development processes and not invite them to problem solve with us. However this often creates unrealistic expectations because our product owners aren't part of the whole development process. When we have a more transparent and collaborative development our product owners and end users are more informed to make the correct requests and increase quality of their feedback.
		- Leadership - Challenge, stress, pressure - Contractor vs PM
		  collapsed:: true
			- (Situation) As a leader driving organizational change is incredibly challenging and even more so if you want to challenge the status, speak up, and offer alternatives without formal authority.
			- Something that I spoked up about and partnered with my supervisors was change was the relationships between my supervisors and the contractor leadership. Before this change occurred it was normal that only contractor leadership and supervisors meet to discuss projects without their PM being in the room. I noticed the contractors abused this relationship and the contractor PM would directly talk to my supervisors whenever they disagreed with my project management decisions.
			- (Task) As a leader I think you should empower the team and give them challenges to help them grow. I found the overreliance on our contractors especially in the product management divisions harmful my growth and learning and wanted to change the environment not only for me but for my colleagues as well.
			- (Action) It did take some time to build up the courage to point out this harmful practice my supervisor. I highlighted that PMs were feeling their opinions and project decision making were sidelined in favor of the contractors. I communicated that we felt we were competing with the contractors whenever the contractors escalated and contacted our supervisors directly without resolving the issues with us directly. It was demotivating and impacting the quality of our work with our development team.
			- After coming to the realization of how this was destructive, immediate changes were made. Our supervisors empower us, we meet with the contractor leadership along with our supervisors in the same room and same time. If contractors contact our supervisors without us, we get brought into the discussion and we work it out with the contractors instead of our leadership taking over those discussions. It took some time and courage to speak up and drive change, but I'm happy I did so. I believe that leadership should empower workers to question the status quo and raise the bar of quality and trust that we'll meet the challenge.
		- Mistake - Orange Book - accountability for me - specific situation where you failed or lead a difficult project.
		  collapsed:: true
			- (Situation) During my first months at OBI, I inherited the Orange Book Nexus Transition Project from a PM who was leaving, so I didn't have a full understanding of the business needs and the product vision. Worse I didn't understand the interconnections of OBI systems between DARRTS, Panorama, and Nexus. A perfect environment for a challenge and ripe for mistakes.
			- (Task) As the FTE lead of Product Management team we were tasked of transitioning the patent review workflow from a manual process to an automated Nexus project. At that time OBI had the initiative to sunset DARRTS. So our solution couldn't create any integrations with DARRTS, even though the business workflow relied on DARRTS information to trigger the workflow.
			- (Action) The implementation team had to think outside the box and we partnered with Integrity and used their parsing functionality to parse pdf content to trigger projects  instead of relying on the manual categories and subcategories afforded by the DARRTS system. The final parsing solution unfortunately fails on pdf files that are scanned or saved in a way that the text is no longer parsable. As a result to cover this gap, I conduct a twice daily check between DARRTS and Nexus to ensure we don't miss any patent submissions.
			- (Result)  Every day since a year ago I am reminded of this mistake. I did not keep myself accountable to ensure I tested the solution, I didn't keep my leadership accountable for the outcomes of the decisions they handed down to my team and I didn't keep my technology partners accountable and responsible to educate us on the limitations of the parsing solution. With every project I make it a high priority to speak up and keep everyone in the team accountable and responsible for delivering their best work.
		- Tell me how you handle conflict at work. Where you disagreed with your boss or supervisor. - Search 360
		  collapsed:: true
			- (Situation) I have great working relationships with my colleagues and supervisors and OBI leadership. But I do remember in my very first months working in OBI I was reviewing the Search 360 results. I noticed that that Search 360 was not indexing all of the submission documents and resulted incomplete search results for the INDs and NDAs affected.
			- (Task) Search 360 was already used by several CDER offices, it had to be fixed to prevent erroneous decision making.
			- (Action) I brought this up to senior leadership but unfortunately my complaints and observation was downplayed as Search 360 was in "beta". Similar pushback and minimizing of the data occurred when brought to the Search 360 team. I disagreed. I was disappointed in the outcomes of these meetings. I went to talk to Tessa instead as she shared a client and patient focused approach to problem solving as her time as a nurse and I was hoping her authority would the needed gravity to my cause.
			- To analyze how wide spread and determine the scope of this bug, I pulled 100 INDs and NDAs in combination and searched through all of them to see if there was a difference in the actual submission files and the Search 360 search results. From the 100 test cases, I found about 40 of them incomplete in Search 360.
			- Tessa was acting director at that time and supported the cause and pushed for a fix within two weeks. It turned out I was correct on severity of the issue and proud to have spoken up to mitigate erosion of our trust between OBI and clients that use our solutions.

		- What is your biggest weakness - curiosity - Kendra 1-1
		  collapsed:: true
			- I took part of this great training called Smarter Leaders, Smarter teams where we learned the concept of curiosity and to be curious about the perspective of others.
			- In talking about problems or even normal conversations I tunnel on my  own thinking instead of also being curious about and actively listening to to my conversation partner.
			- To address this weakness I started creating templates for meeting invites and slide decks, with upfront information ahead of the meeting to elicit questions earlier. Another tool to help for curiosity, is that when I feel a meeting is going badly within a group I follow up with a 1-1 meeting with them directly to ensure they are felt heard and listened to.
			- This happened with Kendra when OBI and PMO first told OGD that Orange Book had to be paused to allow a technical feasibility assessment. I met with the Orange Book Leadership to listen to their complaints after sensing frustration with the messaging and transparency—of the lack of funding for GDUFA III.
			- Because of working on my curiosity, I receive quality feedback from client 1-1 meetings that can help me  understand their needs. Because I was curious I can collaborate better with my clients for an appropriate response—for Kendra we came to the solution for her to request from OBI a detailed list of activities and timelines for GDUFA III work. We continue to meet on a quarterly bases to discuss the OGD IT portfolio.
		- What is your best strength- learning from my mistakes
		  collapsed:: true
			- My biggest strength is learning from my mistakes and not being afraid of failure. As someone whose current role is in the technology and IT field without a formal IT background, I rely heavily on setting a high bar for myself and learning from my mistakes and successes. That's why I'm incredibly active on taking initiatives that challenge the my ability to think critically through issues, coming up with solutions and executing them so I get as much the problem solving experience as possible. Then use that experience to drive organizational change within OBI.
			- For example creating new intake documentation and processes with the PMO, improving leadership of my projects by aligning to agile processes with the PM guide, and build partnerships across OBI and OSP. All these initiatives are from identified gaps from my past projects or lessons learned from others. I've also reached out to new hires and my own peers where we have meeting and talk about our failures and learn from them.
			- I think its important for someone in a leadership position that is responsible and accountable for themselves and of others to continually improve.  I think it's especially important for leadership to create a culture that is open to making mistake and prioritizing learning from it so we can have more proactive OBI members identifying and fixing problems unprompted.
		- Why should we hire you? What makes you the best candidate for this role?
		  collapsed:: true
			- I bring to OBI the drug reviewer and academic perspective of our clients from my time as OND drug regulatory project manager. I also bring an empathetic and patient focused mindset from my work as oncology pharmacist.  When combined with my passion for technology, I'm able to form and nurture relationships between our clients and technology partners. In a team lead role, these partnerships are crucial for identifying and executing initiatives that drive OBI forward. I possess these qualities and I am already leading many initiatives that benefit of OBI, just without the formal title and authority.
			- An example of this is the attempt at standardization and documenting development processes within OBI such as the PM guide, the continual work done on the Onboarding website. I also am partnering with the PMO improving intake processes and documentation and revamping how the PMO monitors the progress and health of several IPT projects.
			- I plan to continue using these combination of experiences to navigate OBI culture to hopefully influence and slowly change the working processes and relationships to a more collaborative team effort. Right now they are often siloed, and hopefully we can transition to a more team-work oriented model
		- Describe your career history
		  collapsed:: true
			- My education is random beginning with 4 year degree in arts and communication, followed with two years working in that field, then spending another 7 years in school to pursue a doctorate in pharmacy. I did an internship with Bayer in their oncology drug development division and experienced the pharmaceutical industry side in drug development. Then I worked as an oncology pharmacist to experience the more patient centered and healthcare focused perspective medicine, and then finally ended up in the drug regulatory side of medicines.
			- I gained a wholistic perspective the pharmaceutical industry from commercial drug development, drug regulation from the FDA, and a patient focused and perspective in my working as oncology pharmacy.
			- I think these experiences combined with my interest in technology and project and product management allows me to digest the company and team  strategy, question it where appropriate and lead a team through initiatives that make OBI better.
		- Tell me more about yourself
			- I think the best way to answer this question is to talk about the things that I do within OBI that is outside my job description.
				- I have an eye for discovering inefficiencies and fixing them. That's why I'm often very active in volunteering or going out of my own in starting process improvement projects. Like the onboarding site when I noticed that there wasn't one and the product management guide when there isn't a well documented development process in OBI.
				- I like to help, even if it goes above and beyond my job description. I will take on additional roles to benefit my client. For example, I act as IT liaison for my supported offices, often connecting them to other super offices to ensure there is coordination for critical projects like connecting both orange book and brands user fee teams to OND during the PDUFA VII changes.  To bridge my clients to OND activities, I attend the OND New Drug Reviews meetings in behalf of both Orange Book and the User Fee teams.
				- As acting liaison, I attend the OBMOD meetings which is a system owned by OIMT for Orange Book to ensure coordination between OIMT and OBI.I also provide VIP customer service to my supported office.
				- On a personal level, I like to read. Right now mostly business books on decision making and strategy, project management and product management to fill in the knowledge gap and experience gap.
					- Decision making books are fascinating to me. Learning new processes on how to do things better are things I tend to do on my free time.
					- I've been employing a lot of what I learn to the job like creating templates and applying decision making approaches to my projects.
