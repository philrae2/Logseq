	- Chapter 3 - Knowledge Sharing
		- Your organization should be able to answer most of its own questions. To achieve organizational knowledge we need both experts who know the answers and mechanisms to distribute expert knowledge. These mechanisms can be simple to the much structured, such as tutorials and classes.
		- Challenges to Learning
			- Lack of psychological safety
				- An environment in which people are afraid to take risks or mistakes in front of others because they fear being punished for it. This can manifest as a culture of fear or a tendency to avoid transparency.
			- Information islands
				- Knowledge fragmentation that occurs in different parts of an organization that don't communicate with one another or use shared resources. In such an environment, each group ends up developing their own ways doing things. This leads to:
					- Information fragmentation
						- Each island has incomplete picture of the bigger whole
					- Information
						- Each island has reinvented its own way of doing something
					- Information skew
						- Each island has its own way of doing the same thing, and these might or might not conflict.
			- Single point of failure
				- When a person ends up owning most of the expertise of a subject, they can become the critical bottleneck of workflows that requires their information.
			- All or nothing expertise
				- This environment arises in a setting where there is no in-between experts and complete novices. This is reinforced when experts always do everything themselves and don't take the time to develop new experts through mentoring or documentation. Knowledge and responsibilities continue to accumulate on those who already have expertise. Novices end up ramping up slowly.
			- Parroting
				- Mimicry without understanding. This is typically characterized by mindlessly copying patterns and processes without understanding their purposes.
		- Documented knowledge can better scale than stored knowledge  by contractors or single individuals. Documents are however more generalized and less applicable to individual learners' situations, and it comes with the added maintenance cost required to keep information relevant and up to date over time.
		- Tribal knowledge exists in the gap between what individual team members know and what is documented.
			- Written knowledge has scaling advantages but so does targeted human help. A human can synthesize their expanse of knowledge. They can assess what information is applicable to the individuals' use case, determine whether the documentation is still relevant, and know where to find it.
		- Setting the Stage: Psychological Safety
		  collapsed:: true
			- Psychological safety is critical to promoting a learning environment.
				- To learn you must first acknowledge that there are things you don't understand. We should welcome such honesty.
				- A critical part of learning is being able to try things and feeling safe to fail.
				- If you try to achieve an impossible goal, there's a good chance you'll fail, but if you fail trying to achieve the impossible, you'll most likely to accomplish far more than you would have accomplished.
					- Failure is a way of learning quickly (provided that you're not repeatedly failing at the same thing)
			- Antipatterns to learning:
				- Feigned surprises ("What?! I can't believe you don't know what the stack is!")
					- Feigned surprises is a barrier to psychological safety and makes members of the group afraid of admitting to a lack of knowledge
				- "Well actuallys"
					- Pedantic corrections that tend to be about grandstanding rather than precision.
				- Back-seat driving
					- Interrupting an existing discussion to offer opinions without committing to the conversation
				- No subtle "-isms" ("It's so easy my grandmother could do it!" )
					- Small expressions of bias (racism, ageism, homophobia) that can make individuals feel unwelcome, disrespected, and or unsafe.
		- Growing Knowledge
		  collapsed:: true
			- Knowledge sharing starts with yourself. It is important to recognize that you always have something to learn.
			- Ask Questions
			  collapsed:: true
				- Always be learning, always be asking questions.
			- Understand Context
				- Learning is not just about understanding new things; it also includes developing and understanding of the decisions behind the design and implementation of existing things.
				- Chesterson's fence - before removing or changing something, first understand why it's there. If you don't see a use for it, that means don't touch it until you do understand the use for it and then assess the use is  no longer needed or can be achieved through some other means.
			- Creating Documentation
				- Write your own documentation and update existing documents as your proficiency grows. Make it easy to find your documentation. Any undiscoverable documentation might as well not be created.
				- Make sure there's a mechanism for feedback . If there's no easy and direct way for readers to indicate that documentation is outdated or inaccurate, they are not likely to bother anyone and the next newcomer will come across the same problem.
				- Writing documentation helps your team and organization scale.
		- Scaling Your Organization's Knowledge
		  collapsed:: true
			- Ensuring that expertise is appropriately shared across the organization becomes more difficult as the organization grows.
			- Cultivating a knowledge sharing culture
				- Knowledge sharing can and should be done with kindness and respect. In tech, toleranceâ€”or worse, reverenceâ€”of the "brilliant jerk" is both pervasive and harmful.
				- Leadership improve the quality of the people around them, improve the team's psychological safety, create a culture of teamwork and collaboration, defuse tensions within the team, set an example of  a good work culture and values. Jerks are not good leaders.
				- Good culture must be actively nurtured and encouraging a culture of knowledge sharing requires a commitment to recognizing and rewarding it at a systemic level. It's a common mistake for organizations to pay lip service to a set of values while actively rewarding behavior that does not enforce those values.
		- Dealing with Low Performers
		  collapsed:: true
			- Hope is not a strategy.
				- And nowhere is hope more overused as a strategy than in dealing with a low performer.
		- Being a leader # [[q: How to be a leader without authority]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- You can lead a team and build consensus without being a close friend of your team (or a monumental hardass). Likewise, you can be
			- The best way to show your team that you don't trust them is to treat them like kidsâ€”people tend to act like the way we treat them. You can manifest this behavior by micromanaging them or simply by being disrespectful of their abilities
			- Lose your ego by trusting your team and not micromanaging them.
			- Most people new to leadership role feel an enormous responsibility to get everything right, to know everything, and to have all the answers. This is assured not to happen.
				- Be secure in your role and be open to questions and disagreements.
				- Apologize when you make a mistake. People have enormous respect for leaders who apologize when they screw up. Apologizing  portrays that you are level headed, good assessing situations, andâ€”coming back to humility, respect, and trustâ€”humble.
				- Keep calm. When people are in leadership positions they are being watched all the time and their actions signals how others should act. The leader's job is to inspire and inspiration is a 24/7 job. Their visible attitude to everything is absolutely noticedâ€”no matter how trivial and can spread infectiously throughout the organization.
				- Be a catalyst. Working to build a consensus is a leadership skill that is often used by unofficial leaders because it's one way you lead without any actual authority.
			- Intrinsic motivation
				- People can be motivated extrinsically (money, fame, power) or intrinsically (autonomy, mastery, and purpose). People are happiest when they are intrinsically motivated.
