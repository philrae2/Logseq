	- Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past.
	- Habit Formation
		- Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain.
			- It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential.
			- Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed.
			- Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds because once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic.
		- The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It‚Äôs one thing to say I‚Äôm the type of person who wants this. It‚Äôs something very different to say I‚Äôm the type of person who is this. The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.
	- Why Create Habits
		- Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.
		- Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it.
			- In fact, the people who don‚Äôt have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you will always be struggling for the next dollar.
		- Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future.
		- This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don‚Äôt need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful. It‚Äôs also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You fall into old patterns before you realize what‚Äôs happening.
	- Changing Habits
		- The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them.
		- The process of behavior change always starts with awareness.
		- Hundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions are effective for sticking to our goals, whether it‚Äôs writing down the exact time and date of when you will get a flu shot or recording the time of your colonoscopy appointment. They increase the odds that people will stick with habits like recycling, studying, going to sleep early, and stopping smoking.
		- People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.
		- When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage.
			- One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.
				- Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit. This method, which was created by BJ Fogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an obvious cue for nearly any habit.*
		- If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues. Consider how many different ways a smoker could be prompted to pull out a cigarette: driving in the car, seeing a friend smoke, feeling stressed at work, and so on.
			- The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you‚Äôll think about your habit throughout the day.
	- Defining what is a good habit
		- Habits like ‚Äúread more‚Äù or ‚Äúeat better‚Äù are worthy causes, but these goals do not provide instruction on how and when to act.
		- Be specific and clear: After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit down at the table. The specificity is important.
		- The more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the time comes to act.
		- The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious.
			- Strategies like implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action.
			- Many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.
			- If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues.
	- Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the influence of the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you. For one person, her couch is the place where she reads for an hour each night. For someone else, the couch is where he watches television and eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Different people can have different memories‚Äîand thus different habits‚Äîassociated with the same place. The good news? You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context.
		- When you can‚Äôt manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is ‚ÄúOne space, one use.‚Äù
		- If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a home.
		- If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable.
	- The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least.
		- It‚Äôs easier to practice self-restraint when you don‚Äôt have to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.
		- You can break a habit, but you‚Äôre unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely‚Äîeven if they go unused for quite a while. And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy.
		- A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
			- If you can‚Äôt seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another room for a few hours. If you‚Äôre continually feeling like you‚Äôre not enough, stop following social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy. If you‚Äôre wasting too much time watching television, move the TV out of the bedroom. If you‚Äôre spending too much money on electronics, quit reading reviews of the latest tech gear. If you‚Äôre playing too many video games, unplug the console and put it in a closet after each use.
			- This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change. Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible. I‚Äôm often surprised by how effective simple changes like these can be. Remove a single cue and the entire habit often fades away.
		- Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it‚Äôs unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.
	- The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.
		- If you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you need to make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law, our goal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing.
		- It is the anticipation of a reward‚Äînot the fulfillment of it‚Äîthat gets us to take action.

	- 38. We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place.
	- 39. You‚Äôre more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time.
	- 40. Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the respect and approval of our peers.
	- 41. We imitate the habits of three groups in particular: The close. The many. The powerful.
	- 42. As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits.
	- 43. One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.
	- 44. Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself.
	- 45. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It‚Äôs friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run.
	- 46. The human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along with others. This is our natural mode. You can override it‚Äîyou can choose to ignore the group or to stop caring what other people think‚Äîbut it takes work. Running against the grain of your culture requires extra effort.
	- 47. When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive.
	- 48. The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we‚Äôd rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.
	- 49. At a deep level, you simply want to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, to win social acceptance and approval, or to achieve status.
	- 50. Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you‚Äôll see that it does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying motives of human nature.
	- 51. Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.
	- 52. Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not.
	- 53. Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered in our discussion of the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing information and noticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment.
	- 54. A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state.
	- 55. Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future. Even the tiniest action is tinged with the motivation to feel differently than you do in the moment.
	- 56. Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make a change. They help us decide the best course of action.
	- 57. Neurologists have discovered that when emotions and feelings are impaired, we actually lose the ability to make decisions. We have no signal of what to pursue and what to avoid. As the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, ‚ÄúIt is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.‚Äù
	- 58. To summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives. Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment.
	- 59. You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience.
	- 60. Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.
	- 61. If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever
	- 62. The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them.
	- 63. It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, ‚ÄúThe best is the enemy of the good.‚Äù I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they‚Äôre not the same. When you‚Äôre in motion, you‚Äôre planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don‚Äôt produce a result. Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that‚Äôs motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that‚Äôs action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that‚Äôs motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that‚Äôs action. Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many times you go talk to the personal trainer, that motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will get the result you‚Äôre looking to achieve. If motion doesn‚Äôt lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we‚Äôre making progress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn‚Äôt feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen. And that‚Äôs the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure. It‚Äôs easy to be in motion and convince

	- 68. If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection.
	- 69. The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy. The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. Focus on taking action, not being in motion. Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.

	- 72. This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy that you‚Äôll do them even when you don‚Äôt feel like it. If you can make your good habits more convenient, you‚Äôll be more likely to follow through on them.
	- 73. One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with your habits is to practice environment design. In Chapter 6, we discussed environment design as a method for making cues more obvious, but you can also optimize your environment to make actions easier. For example, when deciding where to practice a new habit, it is best to choose a place that is already along the path of your daily routine. Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life. You are more likely to go to the gym if it is on your way to work because stopping doesn‚Äôt add much friction to your lifestyle. By comparison, if the gym is off the path of your normal commute‚Äîeven by just a few blocks‚Äînow you‚Äôre going ‚Äúout of your way‚Äù to get there.
	- 74. The Japanese companies looked for every point of friction in the manufacturing process and eliminated it. As they subtracted wasted effort, they added customers and revenue. Similarly, when we remove the points of friction that sap our time and energy, we can achieve more with less effort. (This is one reason tidying up can feel so good: we are simultaneously moving forward and lightening the cognitive load our environment places on us.)
	- 75. The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones.
	- 76. Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy. Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult. Prime your environment to make future actions easier.
	- 77. The most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule, which states, ‚ÄúWhen you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.‚Äù You‚Äôll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute version:

	- 79. Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward. Many habits occur at decisive moments‚Äîchoices that are like a fork in the road‚Äîand either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one. The Two-Minute Rule states, ‚ÄúWhen you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.‚Äù The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. Standardize before you optimize. You can‚Äôt improve a habit that doesn‚Äôt exist.
	- 80. Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it difficult.
	- 81. A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones.
	- 82. When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth.
	- 83. The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits.
	- 84. Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee
	- 85. Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.
	- 86. We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure‚Äîeven minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well‚Äîare signals that tell the brain: ‚ÄúThis feels good. Do this again, next time.‚Äù Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.
	- 87. Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.* You value the present more than the future. Usually, this tendency serves us well. A reward that is certain right now is typically worth more than one that is merely possible in the future. But occasionally, our bias toward instant gratification causes problems.
	- 88. If you‚Äôre willing to wait for the rewards, you‚Äôll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded. This is precisely what research has shown. People who are better at delaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior social skills.
	- 89. The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs in a small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off and that the work was worth the effort.
	- 90. We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.
	- 91. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.
	- 92. This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart‚Äôs Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, ‚ÄúWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.‚Äù Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.
	- 93. In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We mistakenly think the factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you can measure something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the most important thing. And just because you can‚Äôt measure something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not important at all.
	- 94. In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Google famously asks employees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their official job and 20 percent on projects of their choice, which has led to the creation of blockbuster products like AdWords and Gmail.
	- 95. The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you. Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can‚Äôt find a game that favors you, create one. Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on. 19 The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work IN 1955, Disneyland had just opened in Anaheim, California, when a ten-year-old boy walked in and asked for a job.

	- 97. The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It‚Äôs the ability to keep going when work isn‚Äôt exciting that makes the difference. Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.
	- 98. Personally, I employ two primary modes of reflection and review. Each December, I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the previous year. I tally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I published, how many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and more.* Then, I reflect on my progress (or lack thereof) by answering three questions: What went well this year? What didn‚Äôt go so well this year? What did I learn? Six months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an Integrity Report. Like everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My Integrity Report helps me realize where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I use it as a time to revisit my core values and consider whether I have been living in accordance with them. This is when I reflect on my identity and how I can work toward being the type of person I wish to become.* My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions: What are the core values that drive my life and work? How am I living and working with integrity right now? How can I set a higher standard in the future?
	- 99. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.
	- 100. The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors. Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.
