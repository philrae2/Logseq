- **Note:**
	 - When we want to act in one way or the other we consciously or unconsciously create the reasoning for our behaviors.

	 - When we want to be angry or feel disappointed or depressed, we will draw from our negative interpretations of past or current events to act rashly. We can't alter the facts of these events, but we can alter the subjective interpretations to fuel our behavior.
