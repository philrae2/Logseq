title: The Psychology of Human Misjudgment
---

- Charlie used [[Inversion]] to refine his theories of "life" through inversion.  By collecting multiple cases of bad judgment, he used them to ponder ways of avoiding them. 
	 - Charlie looked at mistakes and bad judgments in multiple domains, not only to his, because he believed mistakes don't lie nearly within territorial boundaries, they jump across multiple disciplines. 

- Charlie Munger points out that relying on academic texts for our knowledge is suboptimal. Many academics are like the truffle hound, an animal so trained and bred for one narrow purpose that it is no good at anything else. 

- This article is basically the same as the book [[B: Judgment in Managerial Decision Making]]. I would stop reading this and read that book instead.
