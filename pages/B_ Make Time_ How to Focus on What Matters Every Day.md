- Four Steps to making time
	 - Prioritizing your day
		 - Have one singular task that is your priority for that day. That task should bring you closer to an even bigger long term goal/benefit your system.

	 - Protect yourself from [[distractions]] to ensure your priority task is completed at the end of the day

	 - Protect your body throughout the day to make sure you are at your optimal state to think, work and solve problems

	 - Reflect on the processes employed throughout your day and decide with methods to refine or discard. 

	 - Be keenly aware of your priorities, question the motivations of your actions and ask why you are doing something? Is it getting you closer to your goals or are you just being busy not going anywhere?

	 - Is your business and tasks creating any [[value]]?

- [[goals]]
	 - Goal setting both long term and short term goal, can be unfulfilling, even though they orient you in the right direction. Create habits, systems, and workflows instead that automatically create [[value]].

- [[Highlight]]
	 - Add meaning to your day by prioritizing something you are looking forward to and you enjoy. Create your focus and center of attention on this task. 

	 - There are many frameworks and systems that tell you how to set goals and how to be more productive in getting things done, but they neglect the space in between goals and actions. We neglect the enjoyment and cherishing the work.

	 - Creating a highlight in your day allows you to be intentional on how you spend your time and prevents distractions from robbing you of your time. 

	 - A highlight can be something that must be done (urgent), something that will bring you satisfaction and something that will bring you the most joy. (Your highlights don't have to be job related)

	 - Choose a highlight that can last between 60-90 minutes.

	 - Schedule your highlight
		 - Think about how much time is needed for your highlight

		 - When you want to do your highlight

		 - Put your highlight on the calendar 

- Tackling To-Do List
	 - Create a might-do list and transfer items from the might-do list as a highlight for that day

	 - Limit you to-do list and prioritize them by analyzing your bandwidth for that day

	 - Don't overwhelm yourself by overloading your day with tasks. Be realistic!

- Create barriers to [distractions]([[Distractions]])
	 - The best way to defeat distractions is to make it harder to react

	 - The longer you remain focused on your task the more engaging you'll find it and the better work you'll do. 

	 - Remove distracting applications from your phone

	 - Create barriers and frictions for your distractions

	 - Avoid the infinity pools
		 - Skip the morning check in. Don't check your phone in the morning. 

		 - Skip the news. If it is truly breaking news, then it will find you.
			 - Most news stories are designed to attract you with crimes, scandals, and corruption and is anxiety inducing. 

- Triaging [emails]([[email]])
	 - The less time you spend checking emails you'll be less stressed and just as on top of things. 

	 - Deal with your e-mail later in the day
		 - Probably not the best advice for a project manager

	 - Schedule Email time
