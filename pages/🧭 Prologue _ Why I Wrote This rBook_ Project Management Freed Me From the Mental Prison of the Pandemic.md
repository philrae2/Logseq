title: ðŸ§­ Prologue | Why I Wrote This rBook: Project Management Freed Me From the Mental Prison of the Pandemic
---

- It was April 2020, the first attack of the pandemic.
	 - During that time, it was still unclear how deadly and how transmissible the virus was. Governments had no experience dealing with epidemics. My city decided to put everyone in lock-down.

- I was already years into my journey of entrepreneurship. I realized that to survive in that journey, I had to believe that I was the master of my fate, that I could influence the future, that I could change this little part of the world I operate in.

	 - The lock-down shook this foundation. I was not the master of my fate. I was a prisoner of circumstance. Never have I felt so powerless.
		 - I imagine this is how a priest feels if he lost faith in his church, or how an artist feels if she suddenly becomes deaf to the voice of inspiration. I was lost.

- I discovered Roam a few months before, [[January 22, 2020]] to be exact. Since the world outside was closed off, I retreated to my Roam graph. I used it to study my academic interest (maybe obsession), nanopore sequencing[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanopore_sequencing). I also experimented with [using Roam for morning pages and for mental prayer](https://roambrain.com/using-roam-for-your-spiritual-growth-stack/).

	 - Since the early days, I've seen tweets saying how Roam trains your mind to become more networked. I noticed this in my mind as well.

		 - In the past, the different parts of my life were noted in different software. Business and project management were mostly in Trello, Asana and Google Docs. My academic work was in OneNote and a separate Google Docs account. My personal notes were in OneNote and in Google Keep.

		 - All of these gradually migrated to Roam. Once they were inside my graph, the barriers between them started to crumble. Parts of these different worlds would meet each other through page and block autocompletes. They would sit side-by-side in the Daily Notes Pages.

- One day in April 2020, [[April 24th, 2020]] to be precise, the confluence of these formerly siloed parts of my life presented an opening, an escape from this prison I was in.

	 - > I'll contribute to fighting this pandemic by bringing genomic pathogen surveillance through nanopore sequencing to my city!
		 - __Since reading Liz Gilbert's Big Magic in 2018, I've tried to be more attentive to the voice of inspiration. By 2020, I was already familiar with these voices. They sound like clouds parting, and shining on you is an invitation to a quest: you are shown a vision of an adventure for which life has been preparing you.__ #.book-recommendation

- Of course, I said Yes.
	 - Ten months later I had built an international team of students and professional scientists. We got funding. We sent equipment and provided training to a partner lab in Mindanao, Philippines. On March 2021, that lab made history: the first sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in the world enabled by volunteers, and the first on-site sequencing of any organism in Mindanao, Philippines. This was [[Project Accessible Genomics]].

- This rBook is about that Yes. This is about the craft of bringing ideas to realityâ€”project management.
	 - In my time in corporate tech (in Procter and Gamble and Hewlett-Packard), project management was just a way to earn a living.
		 - As a [project management professional (PMP)](((8cbff9c0-c729-4cb9-a4a5-bb17001f8c91))), I was paid to bring to reality ideas that move the business forwardâ€”from implementation of finance system upgrades to expanding service delivery operations to new markets.
			 - The project management tools that PMP training gave me allowed me to lead projects in that high pressure environment despite my messy mind.

	 - When I started my first business, [Advenient.co](http://advenient.co), I used the craft of project management to bring my own ideas to reality.

	 - [[Project Accessible Genomics]] made me appreciate that project management is more than a skill to sell to employers or to a toolkit for building a business.
		 - With project management, I not only say Yes to inspiration, but I honor that commitment with execution.

		 - With project management, I escaped the prison of circumstance.

		 - And I not only escaped: project management allowed me to turn my prison into the vehicle that is bringing me to the future I envisioned in the past.
			 - Before the pandemic, I already decided that my next business will have something to do with genomics. Through Project Accessible Genomics, the worst year ever became one of my greatest adventures, as well as my training ground to build my next company: [molave.bio](http://molave.bio).

- I'm wrote this rBook to share this power. Whether it is for your employment, for entrepreneurship, or for answering your life's calling, my hope is that these project management tools will be as useful to you as they have been for me.
