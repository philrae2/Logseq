			 - It’s easy to forget that sometimes the best thing we can do to make progress on a project is: nothing at all.
				 - Incubation takes place whether you’re doing nothing at all, or you’re doing something unrelated to the problem at hand.

				 - The [[Alternating Incubation Method]]. With this method, you can complete two projects in parallel, while harnessing the power of Incubation. Let’s say, for example, that I need to write two intro scripts for my podcast. I’ll begin by writing a rough draft of the first script. I’ll then start writing the rough draft for the second script. After that, I’ll return to the first script to edit it. Suddenly, the first script is easier to write. It’s been incubating while I was writing the draft of the second script. I alternate between the two scripts, until they’re both complete.
