	- little over $29 billion in economic profit, or around
	  $17 million each—only 10 percent of the total pie.
	  This share is dwarfed by the $677 billion generated
	  in the top quintile, where each company creates
	  almost 70 times more economic profit than do com-
	  panies in the middle three, and by the nearly
	  $411 billion destroyed in the bottom quintile. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0s2t6scc3s5cppxa7x3eh8w))

	- Economic profit has four components: revenues,
	  margins, asset turns, and the tangible-capital
	  ratio (TCR). Revenues and margins are familiar
	  enough. Asset turns, sometimes described
	  as asset leverage, measure the capacity to extract
	  revenue from a given quantity of assets. TCR
	  is the ratio of physical to total capital, including
	  goodwill

	  (the more M&A a company does,
	  and the higher the premium it pays over book
	  value, the lower its TCR). Every company
	  has a “fingerprint,” hinting at its value formula,
	  across these drivers. A detailed decomposi-
	  tion of the four determinants of value by quintile
	  reveals several things. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0s3xz48pggdjpgawpzvr68d))

	- It’s also easy, though, to go too far in the other direction and make
	  the creation of strategy a rigid, box-checking exercise. Appealing
	  as a formula-driven approach might be, it ignores the truth that strat-
	  egy creation is a journey—and an inherently messy one at that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0s4kmscv0xwyyayx0dbcsd6))
	- Proprietary insights are hard to come by. Shaping keen insights into
	  good strategies requires deep interpersonal engagement and debate
	  from senior executives, as well as the ability to deal with ambiguity
	  in charged and often stressful circumstances. When would-be
	  strategists overlook these dynamics, they cover the essentials in name
	  only. Consequently, they miss opportunities and threats, or create
	  great paper strategies that remain unfinished in practice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0s4m38n6pawhvpt3xx1z656))
