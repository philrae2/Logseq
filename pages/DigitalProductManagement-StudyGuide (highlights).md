					- When creating a hypothesis, you are already thinking about what and how you are measuring, including the targets that indicate whether your hypothesis is correct.
					- The Build Measure Learn cycle forms the validation cycle. Where the hypothesis informs what we test by building an increment of a product then we measure the data to validate the hypothesis or importantly learn from the data to form another hypothesis.

			- Typical Viability questions include:
			  • How large is the market and how much of it can we capture?
			  • How much revenue - and in what timeframe?
			  • Who do we charge, for what and how much?
			  • What will it cost to build and deliver?
			  • Who do we need relationships with?
			  • What supporting activities are required?
		- What is market segmentation? #card
			- Is a process of breaking down your customers to unique and smaller groups so we can build targeted solutions for them.
			- We need to prioritize which customers we want to serve and therefore we can better prioritize the functionalities we build.
			- Market segmentation can help us build the right product for our target customer.

	- Build-Measure-Learn Cycle
		- On the left, we have the Validation or Build-Measure-Learn (BML) cycle. The continuous Validation cycle shows how we go about building digital products. We start with a hypothesis, which Webster’s defines as “a tentative assumption made in order to draw out and test its logical or empirical consequences.” And this is exactly what we do in the BML cycle. Our hypotheses are all about customer problems, solutions, and ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqk9snv8s8mzktcw8d51c5xw)) markets. When we create a well-formed hypothesis, we have decided in advance what and how we will measure, including targets that indicate whether our hypothesis is correct. We then build out our hypotheses into “products” we can test. Your product can be anything from a description of a customer problem we think we can solve, to a feature in a full-fledged product. We measure our built-out “products” by collecting data. Then we use this data to learn. Was our test a success? Did we confirm or refute our hypothesis? Should we build this or that, for one market or another? Can we move on to the next hypothesis or go back to the drawing board?

	- Product-Market Fit triad On the right, we have the Product-Market Fit triad. Each of these three interlocking circles describes a standard our products must meet to be successful in our chosen market. They are:
		- • Valuable: Does our product solve a real problem for real customers?
		- • Viable: Does this product provide net value to our business such that we should offer it? Should we do this?
		- • Feasible: Can we build this product given our company’s constraints – from staffing to compliance to existing technological advances? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqk9v3dknx9a2bgpme1n2bm8))

	- One of the most notable innovations of SaaS is the iterative business model. Think of this as a flywheel. As **a business grows, new customers become happy customers** – and in turn provide referrals to yet more new customers. So goes the cycle of a successful SaaS business: A/R/M or simply ARM.
	  id:: 44e232b8-abbe-460c-b67d-60cc3d367a7f
		- This three-step ARM process is how digital business economics works – particularly in SaaS businesses. They earn revenue based on how well they do in each of these three areas. This doesn’t equate to profit but each part of the ARM sequence is necessary for these businesses to succeed and grow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkbhndyzzy17dedx8xmmwpc))

	- The PM and PO roles are each substantial and it is generally a Best Practice to split these roles across two people into two separate jobs. But some organizations combine these roles into a single job. This can depend on the maturity of the Product, Product Manager and Company.

	- More mature products and PM practices, often at larger companies, separate and differentiate these two roles. If these are two separate roles at your company, it’s important that you be on the same team and staying in step so that you are aligned to the same strategic goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdbhmwj8djapg16fc8tqd5))
	- Other companies combine these into a single job.

	- Product Manager, NOT Project Manager!
		- It is a common confusion – that ProDUCT management is the same as ProJECT management. This is a misconception – and is often received without humor by Product Managers. We are often held responsible for the output of the engineering teams we work with. Did it come out on schedule? Did we meet our cost projections? Was quality high enough? We are not a project manager or even a Scrum Master, which is a specific project management role dictated by Scrum. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkddnq27h9rbbde2bpsag3w))

	- Growth Product Managers You may have heard the term “growth product manager,” you may have one or more of these in your organization, or this may be your title. Growth product managers are PMs who have specific types of goals and employ specific practices to achieve these goals. GPMs are often focused on improving specific business metrics, e.g., “Increase new purchases by 5% this quarter”. They generally rely on doing continuous product experiments to help achieve their goal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdfm83cp7jhqfdr9jazkc9))
	- Your most direct measurements could have to do with usage of the specific feature your team is developing, while the GPM is working to increase the number of users clicking the “buy now” button. The important thing to remember is that it’s a matter of focus. All businesses are working to improve business metrics. Some hire growth product managers to focus on this specifically. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdg2tmva9fh591rfc4wkgm))
	- Product Operations (ProdOps) Teams
		- While product managers often have a wide skill set, managing (and aligning) all the different tools and practices that make up the modern product stack isn’t always the best use of those skills. As product teams grow, the need for alignment becomes bigger and bigger, and this is where Product Operations [ProdOps] comes in.
		- The Product Operations role may incorporate:
			- Coordinating communication to and from PM across the company.
			- Ensuring DPMs are collecting reliable data, have the reports they need, and are designing good experiments. In this way, they can overlap with the role of a data team or in some cases be established instead – to specifically serve the product team.
			- Establishment and maintenance of product tools and processes. Roles on the ProdOps team can include but not limited to: Pricing, Release Management, Data analyst, technical writing, project management, and others. In a growing product organization, a ProdOps team can lay the foundation for a successful, data-driven team of product managers.

	- 1. Boosting overall revenue/conversion – because of greater ease of use leads to better emotional attachment to the brand and resulting customer loyalty.
	- 2. Increased customer satisfaction – because customers love well-designed products that give them what they need and want (and what they don’t know they need and want).
	- 3. Lower support costs – because pre-empting so many likely user problems via UX techniques lowers the company’s costs.
	- 4. Reduced development waste – which increases development efficiency and thus saves money in the development phase.

They join forces to ensure that what they are creating is valuable and usable for customers. The difference between them is often at the detailed level. Product Managers are not typically responsible for UI design, while UX researchers and designers don’t dive deeply into the business viability of their products.

	- Four Data Team Archetypes The data teams at your company typically break into four types of roles. It’s very helpful for you to know the difference so that you can figure out who to work with for what purpose. Some people have more than one of these characteristics and well-staffed data science teams have all four. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmamjfbzmvp6t451cbkhqf))
		- 1. Data Detectives understand how to get the data to help stakeholders answer their questions and develop strategy. • Examples – market researchers, User Experience Research • They use tools like Qualtrics or Survey Monkey, or academic research sources. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmatgjmr5edb5t69drmnkn))
		- 2. Data Guardians build databases and understand their data dictionaries, perhaps managing a data warehouse. • Examples – Database Administrators (DBAs). Database administration is an operational or technical function responsible for physical database design, security enforcement, and database performance. Tasks include maintaining the data dictionary, monitoring performance, and enforcing organizational standards and security. • Their tooling is often based on SQL, a common language for managing data held in a relational database. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmaym3vga38r87qbtk4p14))
		- 3. Data Wranglers are typically programmers who build automation to pull data from APIs and databases. They may also build and run advanced analytical models. • Example – Data Engineers and Statisticians • Data Wranglers work in code – nowadays this is frequently Python. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmbbcasstf2x3dzf6gzf9z))

	- As a digital product manager, data detective and data storyteller skills are very valuable. It matters less if you can write SQL queries if you know how to ask great questions and what data is likely to answer these. And using data to illustrate stories is essential for PMs to communicate effectively and enroll fellow employees, teammates and management.

	- The DPM as Change Agent As you now know, leading change and making decisions are essential for successful digital transformation and execution.

	- Effective Meetings and Decision-Making
		- Two things kill productivity and velocity like nothing else: Meetings and re-making already-made decisions. For Digital Products, ‘moving fast’ means we must make decisions fast – BUT - as of 2015, we conduct somewhere between 36M-56M meetings in the US / day, and up to 50% of these meetings are a waste of time, costing at least $37B per year! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxry7r0g56shcsr0xxxm9pm))
	- Use this framework to streamline and kill the time-wasting things that kill your productivity: 1. Do we really need to meet? [[Q - How to run a meeting]]
		- Fewer and shorter meetings – try 15- or 30-min meetings where you used to have 60- mins. Start on time! Plan to end 5 minutes early if you can.
		- Standups vs ‘Status’ – Daily Standups aren’t just for your sprint team! Many executive staff do the same thing. 15 mins in the morning to focus – then go get it done.
		- Publish status, issues, plans – don’t fill a room to talk about it. 2. Before you meet, prepare!
		- Publish meeting purpose and agenda with times and owners. Decisions to be made, by who.
		- Send pre-reading ahead, e.g. your background or supporting data. Give people enough time to read it so they can come prepared to support your ask or have prepared questions and comments. This is an agreement.
		- Invite empowered attendees – sometimes the right decision makers can’t be there – negotiate decision proxies. 3. During and After, make it stick! • Have your recommendations ready – don’t ask ‘what should we do?’ • Publish / waterfall outcomes – so nobody can claim ‘they didn’t know’ or having to meet again for the same purpose.

	- DACI is a tool to help organizations assign responsibilities and make decisions. There are 4 possible roles within the DACI framework:
		- Driver - 1 person driving the decision to closure. The ‘point’ person.
		- Approver - 1-2 people approving the decision. Generally, the executive paying for it.
		- Contributor - Provides information or implements the decision.
		- Informed - Notified but not part of the decision process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxrxte03fhce8xpp1p1t3p0))
	- Both DACI and RACI frameworks can be used when an organization needs to document who has the final authority to make a decision. The tendency is for a lot of people being able to say no and no one person clearly being able to say yes – and having it stick. There are 4 options in DACI, and unlike RACI, one person can only have ONE setting. They can drive the decision forward, they can approve of a decision, they can contribute to a decision, or they can be Informed about a decision. This makes the DACI framework generally preferable to the RACI. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxrzak54sky6kqbz8g1a0qm))
	- Definitions: Outcomes and Output
		- In our work as DPMs, we can end up very focused on managing projects – shipping on time, on budget. Obviously, it’s very important to our success to get products out the door. As important as project management is, we are not project managers. We are focused on ensuring product-market fit, in other words, on the success of the business through providing value to customers. Instead of measuring our work by the projects we ship (‘output’), we need to measure our work by the ‘outcomes’ we create as a result of what we ship. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxrzyrfaeyc8khgq166zav8))
	- There are two types of outcomes we focus on as product managers.
		- Business Outcomes are measurable company goals, for instance Monthly Recurring Revenue. We sometimes call these metrics Key Performance Indicators. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxs0awfxwxz1mq88vzwvz4b))
		- Product Outcomes are the actual changes in human behavior that result from the changes to our products. These often revolve around measuring usage of our products or some aspects of our products. As product managers, the mechanism by which we influence those business outcomes is typically by causing product outcomes to happen. If more people use our features, we see better business outcomes as a result. If more people click on a ‘buy now’ button, we generate more revenue. So, Output is just an event that triggers these more sustained product and business outcomes. It is not in and of itself the goal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxs0zhgdmdmystmxhvb66yq))
	- OKRs are a type of SMART Goals that are written in a specific format, with some special characteristics.
		- OKRs are divided into Objectives – or strategic goals– and Key Results – or measurements of progress towards the goal. An Objective is an overarching theme of what you want to accomplish, usually qualitative. According to Google – veteran users of OKRs - you should use expressions that convey endpoints and states, such as “climb the mountain,” “eat 5 pies,” “ship feature Y.” They should be inspirational statements - written in the language likely to inspire your team. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxt8pm8983bzfsaf389pjr4))
	- **Key results should be quantitative metrics or at least a measurable milestone on the way to your objective.** **They are the “target” that you seek, not a task.** As Google suggests, **“Key results should describe outcomes, not activities.”** KRs answer whether you succeeded in achieving the objective.
	  id:: f548306d-dc50-45bb-9564-694c1fe0e69e
		- For example, your team may have a 2020 Objective that reads “Launch an amazing product that blows our customers’ minds”. Key Q1 results for this Objective could be: 1. 20% of trials convert to purchase in the first month. 2. Average user rating of 8/10 “would recommend”. 3. Customers use the product an average of 5x per week. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxt9bf1y8dhpg3takafargq))
	- **The primary purpose of OKRs is to create alignment in the organization. To do so, OKRs should be public to all company levels. OKRs are meant to be more flexible and lightweight than static annual planning. If a company is always reaching 100% of its goals, they are too easy.** OKRs are meant to be bold and ambitious, which means that some portion are “moonshots” with a high degree of risk. To enable ambitious goal-setting, OKRs should be decoupled from compensation and promotion. They are a management tool, not an employee evaluation tool!

	- As we learned, OKRs are useful for planning where you are going. In order to measure how fast you have been traveling and whether you are on course, your business needs KPIs. KPI is a common abbreviation meaning “Key Performance Indicator.” But don’t let that fool you – KPIs are just the metrics your company considers important. KPIs are based on the data your company collects from customer activity, including both economic activity and actions performed in your products themselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxtbq3m8awzdg1vythegkkr))
	- KPIs come in roughly two categories
		- Product and Business. Product KPIs measure whether customers are using and getting value from our product. They can provide leading indicators of success that determine whether your business will succeed in the next month, quarter or year. Succeeding with users of your product should lead to success in the business.
		- Business KPIs are described as “lagging” because they reflect a business result that may have been a long time in the making. This is especially true with B2B products. Whatever type of business you are in, monitoring Product KPIs can show you trouble brewing with users and let you fix it before it becomes an issue for the business. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxva8hhjvd9fpr2fv9rt63z))
	- Here are six indicators of User Engagement, or whether users find value in a product or service. These KPIs correspond to the following questions:
	  id:: a3bc5d5b-7806-48d2-87aa-ba50e4ba110c
		- Breath - How many active users do we have? For B2B, this could be how many users per paying customer?
		- Depth - How much of our product do they use? Are they using only 20% of our features? Which ones? Frequency - How often do users login or visit? All day, once a week? Once a month? Who (and which groups) logs in when?
		- Efficiency/Usability - How hard is it to complete tasks? Where do users get stuck?
		- Paths & Funnels - What do they do, in what order? Often, there is more than one way to accomplish a task. What’s the most-common way so we can optimize our user journey?
		- Feedback – how well did that new feature you just tried work? What can we do on this screen to make this feature work better? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxvb9tkmfqmzygsvt3gzh8n))
	- DEPTH is about measuring key features / functions rather than users and is expressed accordingly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxvcpr0arky6n92f1mpak7s))

	- BREADTH measures the number of users in a given time period. This includes the popular metrics of Daily Active Users (or DAU) and Monthly Active Users (or MAU). DAU/MAU is the ratio of daily active users divided by monthly active users, expressed as a percentage.
	  id:: 63d69a58-8d71-4b35-869e-504ee9b71f0f
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674965321127_0.png)
		- DAU/MAU is considered a better gauge than either number alone, as it measures a relative level of retention as well as pure usage. Consumer apps that reach greater than 20% DAU/MAU are considered to have good engagement, while 50% and more is considered world-class. Think apps like Facebook or Twitter, often accessed many times per day by users. A “good” DAU/MAU ratio – and usage breadth in general - is contextual based on your product. Tax prep products are very valuable and lucrative, but may only get used at certain times in the year, making DAU meaningless in, say, August. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxvdfqsxm42ync0hmv55n77))
	- Frequency helps fill in the picture of your active users by telling you **how often they are using your app and for how long**. In that sense, Frequency can provide a truer sense of the value your customers are deriving. Conversely, **time spent in app (or multiple logins per user) could indicate usability or learnability issues** if customers are spending more time than desired in your app, or have to log in repeatedly to get their jobs done.

	- A powerful feature of some product analytics tools is the ability to visualize ”funnels” or paths in your product.

	- Customer sentiment is another type of metric that is related to both the product and the business. **Many companies use Net Promoter Scores to measure customer sentiment.** NPS typically measures the WHOLE product – the entire company as well as the specific products. NPS has become somewhat controversial in recent years, for two primary reasons:
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674965444133_0.png)
		- It asks about future likely behavior rather than measuring actual observed behavior – which is the gold standard.
		- There is minimal data proving a causal relationship between NPS and business success. Some companies now favor other direct measures of customer satisfaction and referrals. But NPS is still an extremely common way of evaluating customer satisfaction, assuming that only customers who are wildly satisfied will provide word-of-mouth marketing for your business.

	- ARR and MRR are important to Digital Businesses because they enable financial forecasting. MRR in particular is a close-to-real-time measure of growth. If your contracts are annualized, you can calculate ARR regardless of whether you bill annually, monthly or both. If contracts run on a monthly basis, you should use MRR.

		- Focus on the subscription revenue you can rely on through the life of a contract. One-time revenue such as from training shouldn’t count towards ARR calculations because it doesn’t repeat. Quiz: You have 100 customers on a monthly plan @ $300 / month. What is the total ARR and MRR for your customer base?

	- **ARPA / ARPU help you understand how much you need to scale your business to succeed.** Low ARPA means you’ll need to acquire a lot of individual customers to break $1M ARR. If you have lower volume, it also means you need to operate your business in a lower-cost fashion in order to turn a profit, such as reducing expensive customer acquisition tactics.

		- As we mentioned, low ARPA means you need a higher volume of customers to meet revenue goals. Spreading your revenue across a lot of customers can also reduce the risk of losing any individual customer. Smaller customers also tend to accept your standard product as is, which can make life easier for product management. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxxqwbmbwhj3vdk0z13nqkr))
		- High ARPA concentrates your revenue in the hands of just a few large customers. B2B and especially enterprise software companies tend to focus a lot on ‘Elephants’, which can be problematic as they often demand customized products. Supporting Elephant customers and their hundreds or thousands of users can also be a major drain on profitability. Winning Elephants takes a lot of work and can cost a lot of money. Losing them really hurts. On the other hand, it can be worth it for the revenue and reference-ability of major customers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxxqyhwxh94wdgcwdjcfz4g))

	- LTV is the predicted amount a customer will spend with you thru your relationship. LTV helps you move from transaction-based thinking to the long-term value of repeat business. Lifetime value is somewhat more complex to calculate, so we won’t practice it here. However, it’s one of the most important metrics for you to track.

		- Calculating LTV requires several component metrics such as recurring revenue and churn rate. LTV is especially valuable when matched with the cost of acquiring a customer. If you know how much a customer’s value will be over the course of a lifetime, then you can make smarter decisions about what to spend on them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxxt4nv6vdncdc0r98dpqg1))
	- Money that’s spent convincing a customer to make a purchase is called the Customer Acquisition Cost. In order to be profitable, at the simplest level, customer acquisition cost will need to be lower than customer lifetime value, since you need to make more money than you spend acquiring the customer.

	- Churn of paying customers has a direct effect on customer LTV. If you can halve your churn rate, it will double your LTV. Churn is often caused by low customer satisfaction, which can be a leading indicator. For this reason, you should keep tabs on customer satisfaction using customer surveys and Net Promoter Scores to try to head off churn before it occurs. If your business runs on longer term contracts, another key metric to focus on is renewals. A single-digit improvement in Churn can make a huge difference in renewals.

		  collapsed:: true
			- UX is a key part of this team – but this is not a ‘Design’ activity. It posits that the best way to validate opportunities is to create solution prototypes. For example, creating a survey to validate a problem is not sufficient - putting potential customers in front of a pretotype enables you to validate value by asking “is this what you meant”?

		- Even though design thinking is fundamentally a qualitative Discovery process – testing and validation are built into this. You don’t stop after you define your ideas. You need to get back in the market and validate the value of your ideas with the use of prototypes. The phases deliberately end with “Test.” Design thinking doesn’t get you all the way to a product. Instead, it validates an opportunity and gives you a strong head start on how that opportunity could be addressed. Be sure to consider in advance what “success” will mean.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr08em75yagfx8s0yknz1133))
		- Part two of this skill set is asking the open-ended question – this is a question without a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. These two techniques can change not only your life as a PM, but also other aspects of work and even home life. When a customer answers your question, be prepared to follow their lead: Use the phrases “Tell me more” to take the conversation to a deeper level. After completing the interviews, debrief with your team on your Learnings and Themes. Learnings are the recollections of what stood out during a conversation or observation: direct quotes, anecdotes, notes on body language. Learnings should be captured in full sentences to capture the story. Themes are created after you have organized the stories from your field research into categories. Did you hear similar statements or observations from multiple people? Themes are the headlines for clusters of similar learnings.

	- ‘Pretotype’ is not a typo! The concept was developed by Alberto Savoia of Google and fully developed in his book The Right It. Prototypes try to get to the core of questions around building a product, will it work well and what will it cost to make. They ask the question: "CAN we make this?"

		- Concierge test – a service offered manually to validate the value of solving a particular problem. Wealthfront, for instance, initially created a concierge test to provide wealth management advice and portfolio management. They would sit with customers, pen and paper in hand, and figure out solutions to wealth management issues, step by step. Of course, it was not scalable – but it didn’t have to be to prove out the value.

	- Viability and Cost Estimation – Cost Estimates are generated by considering time, labor and other fixed / variable costs to get a product to market. However, most early engineering estimates of major projects are wrong. Estimating accuracy varies greatly by the size of work, familiarity of the team, and other factors. Estimates at the early stage are approximate-only – you should leave a lot of ‘wiggle room’. ‘T-shirt-sizes’ are often used for early project costs by engineering.

	- Market Segmentation
		- You can’t serve all potential customer needs with the same product. Segmentation is the process of taking the vast world of potential customers and breaking them down into smaller unique groups with similar needs which are likely to react the same way to your marketing and to your product. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gbb54kymevngf265wwh9x))
		- It’s important to develop the right product for your target market segment, and that you invest your marketing money effectively. Selected segments determine what marketing programs, messages and activities are used to reach that target group. For example, beer is targeted differently at males in their 20s than women in their 30s. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gbpyx6ebvksexv7yw8bfq))
	- Segment by market needs, not by product feature. Customers buy for a variety of reasons.
	  Here are some common Consumer-specific Segmentation Criteria:
	  • Geographic
	  • Demographic (Age, gender, income, education, health..)
	  • Psychographics: Values, attitudes and lifestyles
	  • Vertical: Interest, expertise ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gnbkzjahha537jkeh52b7))
	- Consumers buy for a variety of reasons. For example, if you sell luxury cars, you need to understand the emotional pull of a new car and the psychological benefit it gives the buyer. Each psychographic segment considers purchases differently depending on their aspirations and goals, not just their income. For example, in spite of limited budgets, some less-affluent segments may be more inclined to buy brand name products because buying store brand products makes them feel poor. It’s worth the emotional boost to buy the brand. Every purchase has an emotional aspect and you need to figure out what that is for each of your segments.

	- Value Proposition 101
	  id:: fc25a520-98c5-4d88-a7dc-2eb208da0450
	  A Value Proposition is a concise statement that summarizes how you’ve uniquely solved an important problem for a specific group of people. It signals to prospective buyers that:
	  • They’re not alone
	  • A solution to their problem exists
	  • Only you offer it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gq3xnpab8bse0ed0tyw82))
	- Remember the Value Proposition must be Unique for each market segment!
	  id:: 60df1c3f-3f0b-4019-9c91-161c6dd5a05e
	  Example: For Facebook, the value prop is different for Users (connectivity etc) and Advertisers
	  (reaching those users w/ targeted ads). For Google, the value prop is, likewise, different for
	  Users (searching) and Advertisers (reaching those users). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gqkvd1c0qf1sxgx2j43xm))
	- The Lean Canvas is a one-page business plan template that helps you deconstruct your idea into its key assumptions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gr1fc1fc7qesshwbsby80))
	  id:: c9395224-2c45-4c19-8b38-cc689684c359
	- It was adapted by Ash Maurya from Alex Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas and then optimized for Lean Startups. The Lean Canvas replaces elaborate business plans with a single- page business model. Business plans have historically taken too long to write, are seldom updated, and often are never read. However, documenting your plan is key. Lean Canvas attempts to resolve this conflict by replacing long and boring business plans with a one-page model that takes a few minutes to create - and actually gets read and maintained!

	- Recall: An MVP is a new product that is developed with sufficient value to satisfy early adopters – who by definition are not already customers. Typically, an MVP does not replace a prior version of the same product. A Minimum Business Increment is the smallest piece of functionality that can be delivered to existing customers which provides value to those customers and to the business ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gzbrpnmj3a3jxzvbnsrnj))
	- Here are some characteristics of an MBI.
	  • Provides valuable feedback that the right functionality is being built - and that it is being
	  built in the right way
	  • Enhances the ability of the organization to deliver value in the future
	  • Contains all of the pieces required for value realization. This includes any work required by
	  documentation, ops and marketing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gzfr525car9781zszfdzf))
	- For IT projects, the value realized may be for the business itself, eg:
	  • Paying down technical debt
	  • Lean-Agile Transformations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gzy4y5h2n7qkvwng6z8e6))
	- • Improvements to Platforms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5h018j8f0n8rnjsqnkc3w8))
	- Use “MVP” with Care - MVP is the minimum functionality to learn from visionary early adopters. Visionary customers can fill in the gaps on missing features - if the product solves a real problem. MVP is a concept that originated in the lean startup methodology introduced by Eric Ries in 2011. In general, the lean startup focuses on the influence of testing and learning on new product development. And MVP encapsulates that approach perfectly. MVP is about Validated Learning! It may not necessarily be a “product release”. “Viable” can be extensive for mature products and existing customers. Building an MVP requires a commitment to iterate! MVP or Minimum Viable Product is a term we love, and love to hate. Minimal – doesn’t mean crippled, lacking, unreliable or non-functional! Rather, it means: “what’s the smallest & fastest-to-deliver chunk of value we can deliver, right now, that will thrill customers so much, that they will buy it now and wait for the other stuff.” MVP should certainly be good enough that’s it’s worth paying for- so you can ‘Earn while you Learn’ or the converse. This is the real test of MVP ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5h0cxxehhgp6j25mgjpnbd))

	- Your CORE product is your Value Prop - NOT the tangible, physical product. You can’t
	  touch it. That’s because the core product is the BENEFIT of the product that makes it valuable
	  to your buyer & user. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5jcjjn6qpw7ajyzv62frak))
	- The ACTUAL product is the tangible, software, service, or physical product. You can get
	  some use out of it. PMs often focus on the actual product: What goes in it, what isn’t in it. As
	  PMs, we all love our product features. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5jcqm2vtdr184n9qhqgftr))
	- The AUGMENTED product contains several to many attributes often contribute heavily to
	  product success. The AUGMENTED product is the non-physical part of the product. It usually
	  consists of lots of added value, for which you may or may not pay a premium.
	  Customers focus on a wider definition of product. They focus on the benefits that a product
	  brings to them. Then they consider the actual product attributes. And they also consider the
	  value of the augmented product. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5jd7zx3kwdk7hjgh5y5mrv))
