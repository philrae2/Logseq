		- Revenues are not all the same. There are two types one-time revenue (OTR) and recurring revenue
			- One-time revenue provides two advantages
			  collapsed:: true
				- Faster growth
					- Provides immediate money to invest in growth
				- Bigger margins
			- For those with SaaS solutions prefer recurring or subscription models because
			  collapsed:: true
				- Better predictability
				- More multiples provide easier time to calculate value and metrics in multiple ways
				- Higher lifetime value because you're providing value over time, the customer will do the same for you
			- It is recommended to model both pricing schemes to determine what is the right long-term mix for your business
		- Types of Pricing
		  collapsed:: true
			- Per-user pricing
			  collapsed:: true
				- Relic of the past. Per user pricing is rarely how customers experience the value of your product. In B2B software some users are likely to use some functions but not others.
				- It's often better to create tiers or packages to match what your users actually need and price them accordingly to the value different users derive.
			- Cost-plus pricing
			  collapsed:: true
				- The selling price is set by evaluating all variable costs the company incurs and adding a markup percentage to establish the price. However, this is inwardly focused and not what your customers think or feel. They don't care about costs they care about value
					- You may end up pricing too high or too low (users value your product more than what you are charging)
			- Competitor-based pricing
			  collapsed:: true
				- Uses competitor's price as a benchmark.
				- It might be close to optimal if you're in a competitive market.
				- However, you don't develop your own pricing and your decisions are indirectly guided by your competitors.
			- Value-based pricing
			  collapsed:: true
				- Only value-based pricing maximizes profitability
				- Pricing is based on how much target consumers believe a product is worth.
				- Value-based pricing takes more work. You must really know your customers and what is important to them.
			- User-based Pricing
			  collapsed:: true
				- Depends on a developed Value Metric
				- Defined as a pricing model where the amount a customer pays is determined by how much or how many of something a customer uses
				- Four types of user-based pricing
					- Flat-tiered subscription pricing
						- Small customers paly less than medium customers, and large customers pay more than medium customers
					- Flat-tiered + Overages
						- Users are charged for going over their allotted amount subscription
					- Flat Subscription + usage
						- Users are charged a base subscription fee and additional usage
					- Linear pricing
						- The cost to the customer is simply usage based. This model is sometimes referred to as pay-as-you-go or consumption-based pricing.
		- What is a Value Metric?
		  collapsed:: true
			- Your value metric is the thing you charge for in your product. It has 3 vital characterisitcs
				- It aligns to your customer's needs
				- It's easy to understand
				- It grows with your customers use, creating win/win for both parties
			- Value metrics should be tuned to what your target customers will pay for
			- Value metrics are not only external they can also point inwardly to measure if your company is delivering value to your customers
			  collapsed:: true
				- RevRec's acceleartion
				- Implementation cycle time, errors, cost reduction
				- Support cycle time or ticket reductioon
				- Headcount reduction or re-allocation
				- Other CapEx, OpEx spend
				- These metrics allow clear communication of the project's value and align the benefits to the organization asking for the investment to deliver them.

		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675831637116_0.png)
		  collapsed:: true
			- Value proposition
				- The value proposition is the clear message about your offering. It should define the product and explain its target market, the primary benefit to customers and what makes it different from competitors.
			- Revenue Stream box captures how you will charge for your product and your value metric(s).
			  id:: 640e322b-d6d8-462e-818b-fc542127a5e0
				- For a business to sustain itself it must always capture value somewhere. For example Facebook captures value from advertisers while free users are only valuable because advertisers are paying for their attention.
			- Once the value metric is developed the business can design strategies to charge for it.
		- Packaging
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675831844601_0.png)
			- The other essential part of pricing
			- Packaging your product in different configurations is an essential part of delivering your product. Packaging reflects a pre-assembled grouping of features which reflect segmentation and provides:
				- Targeted value for specific personas and segments: these bundles should deliver no more and no less than what the segment values most.
				- Convenience: Packages take friction out of customers buying just what they need with fewer clicks  and trips to the store.
				- Opportunity for Cross-sell & Up-sell: Once the customer has found value with what they've purchased, they're more likely to buy other packages from you
				- A fence against value leaks—don't give away what customers are willing to pay for
			- Consider and test packaging decisions carefully - based on as much data as you gather upfront.

	- The Practices of Digital Organizations
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674611241747_0.png) These drawings illustrate two of the foundational concepts in Digital Product Management: the iterative, continuous, interconnected nature of creating digital products, which is unlike linear processes of traditional business. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqh56c9yfb6ha7jwj0rz48vq))

	- Build-Measure-Learn Cycle
		- On the left, we have the Validation or Build-Measure-Learn (BML) cycle. The continuous Validation cycle shows how we go about building digital products. We start with a hypothesis, which Webster’s defines as “a tentative assumption made in order to draw out and test its logical or empirical consequences.” And this is exactly what we do in the BML cycle. Our hypotheses are all about customer problems, solutions, and ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqk9snv8s8mzktcw8d51c5xw)) markets. When we create a well-formed hypothesis, we have decided in advance what and how we will measure, including targets that indicate whether our hypothesis is correct. We then build out our hypotheses into “products” we can test. Your product can be anything from a description of a customer problem we think we can solve, to a feature in a full-fledged product. We measure our built-out “products” by collecting data. Then we use this data to learn. Was our test a success? Did we confirm or refute our hypothesis? Should we build this or that, for one market or another? Can we move on to the next hypothesis or go back to the drawing board? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqk9t8vwv7v3tm6njs392ms9))
	- Product-Market Fit triad On the right, we have the Product-Market Fit triad. Each of these three interlocking circles describes a standard our products must meet to be successful in our chosen market. They are:
		- • Valuable: Does our product solve a real problem for real customers?
		- • Viable: Does this product provide net value to our business such that we should offer it? Should we do this?
		- • Feasible: Can we build this product given our company’s constraints – from staffing to compliance to existing technological advances? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqk9v3dknx9a2bgpme1n2bm8))

	- What is a Digital Product?
		- A digital product is any product delivered online that doesn’t have physical form or substance. You can’t hold a website theme in your hand, smell an e-book, or taste an application. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkcbkwja01revasaj3zdr6p))
		  id:: 63d0b6c0-900d-4612-adce-85afce3e2bbf
		- Note: Software installed on-premise - whether on PC or ‘servers’ - is not Digital in the context of this course unless it can be updated easily via the internet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkcc4f03kdd474hg0erk5r2))
		  id:: cff16e28-61d2-4642-838d-9cac3d84f756
	- It is our primary job as Digital Product Managers to strive for Product-Market Fit in everything our teams do – from major launches to minor features. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkbdczcdbgrs0vc0vpf9g41))
	  id:: 63d34335-bb90-45dd-978d-649114be6212
	- Finally, achieving Product-Market Fit is not a one-time event, nor is it immediate. It is also an iterative process, as illustrated by the center arrows. In fact, it is going through the Build- Measure-Learn Cycle that allows us to achieve Product-Market Fit over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkbe48mxmjevdcrayk2ewec))
	  id:: 63d34335-55f1-46cb-8dba-72d0692beb3f
	- One of the most notable innovations of SaaS is the iterative business model. Think of this as a flywheel. As **a business grows, new customers become happy customers** – and in turn provide referrals to yet more new customers. So goes the cycle of a successful SaaS business: A/R/M or simply ARM.
	  id:: 44e232b8-abbe-460c-b67d-60cc3d367a7f
		- This three-step ARM process is how digital business economics works – particularly in SaaS businesses. They earn revenue based on how well they do in each of these three areas. This doesn’t equate to profit but each part of the ARM sequence is necessary for these businesses to succeed and grow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkbhndyzzy17dedx8xmmwpc))

	- Product-Led Growth (PLG) refers to a model that uses your product and your users as the primary mechanism to drive growth. You acquire new customers, while retaining and monetizing your existing customers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkbsny4s1nwhaag9st9xe2m))
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674613387417_0.png)
		- While simple in concept, this is in stark contrast to the well-worn model of using Sales and Marketing teams and programs for these efforts. And, here, ‘Service’ means most, or all customer-facing transactions are handled inside the product: Implementation, Onboarding, Product Support, Upsell, and Renewals, among others. We can do this only with Digital Products because we are in continuous contact with our users! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkbt6964tqahk2rxfq9gj94))
	- The Digital Product Manager Role The role of the digital product manager is complex and multi-faceted. It centers around the six interlocking skills listed here:

	- The PM and PO roles are each substantial and it is generally a Best Practice to split these roles across two people into two separate jobs. But some organizations combine these roles into a single job. This can depend on the maturity of the Product, Product Manager and Company. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdb6r2w1m17pn956eazv1c))

		  id:: 63d34335-2715-46b1-b33e-2d46edf19016
	- More mature products and PM practices, often at larger companies, separate and differentiate these two roles. If these are two separate roles at your company, it’s important that you be on the same team and staying in step so that you are aligned to the same strategic goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdbhmwj8djapg16fc8tqd5))
	- Other companies combine these into a single job. If you are acting as product owner, remember that this is a set of tasks you are responsible for, but Product Manager is your JOB and it is much broader than writing and prioritizing stories. **Product Managers typically need to do a lot of future planning, opportunity assessment and prioritizing.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdc18dhtewx9y0ftc2ehhd))
	- The big issue here is that all of these tasks need to get done. And you need to have clarity on who has responsibility for each of these items. When you map the two roles into one, you can see that the Product Owner is responsible for the detailed execution and delivery work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdcgyh0mepn2ay96j8mx53))
	- Product Manager, NOT Project Manager!
		- It is a common confusion – that ProDUCT management is the same as ProJECT management. This is a misconception – and is often received without humor by Product Managers. We are often held responsible for the output of the engineering teams we work with. Did it come out on schedule? Did we meet our cost projections? Was quality high enough? We are not a project manager or even a Scrum Master, which is a specific project management role dictated by Scrum. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkddnq27h9rbbde2bpsag3w))
	- Our work as Digital Product Managers is about enabling the success of the business. If our projects are on time, on budget and have few defects – but no-one uses them, buys them, or they fail to hit any of our business targets – we have ALL failed! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkde41zzmh1qd5wp96c4kk1))
	- Growth Product Managers You may have heard the term “growth product manager,” you may have one or more of these in your organization, or this may be your title. Growth product managers are PMs who have specific types of goals and employ specific practices to achieve these goals. GPMs are often focused on improving specific business metrics, e.g., “Increase new purchases by 5% this quarter”. They generally rely on doing continuous product experiments to help achieve their goal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdfm83cp7jhqfdr9jazkc9))
	- Your most direct measurements could have to do with usage of the specific feature your team is developing, while the GPM is working to increase the number of users clicking the “buy now” button. The important thing to remember is that it’s a matter of focus. All businesses are working to improve business metrics. Some hire growth product managers to focus on this specifically. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdg2tmva9fh591rfc4wkgm))
	- Product Operations (ProdOps) Teams
		- While product managers often have a wide skill set, managing (and aligning) all the different tools and practices that make up the modern product stack isn’t always the best use of those skills. As product teams grow, the need for alignment becomes bigger and bigger, and this is where Product Operations [ProdOps] comes in.
		- The Product Operations role may incorporate:
			- Coordinating communication to and from PM across the company.
			- Ensuring DPMs are collecting reliable data, have the reports they need, and are designing good experiments. In this way, they can overlap with the role of a data team or in some cases be established instead – to specifically serve the product team.
			- Establishment and maintenance of product tools and processes. Roles on the ProdOps team can include but not limited to: Pricing, Release Management, Data analyst, technical writing, project management, and others. In a growing product organization, a ProdOps team can lay the foundation for a successful, data-driven team of product managers.

	- 1. Boosting overall revenue/conversion – because of greater ease of use leads to better emotional attachment to the brand and resulting customer loyalty.
	- 2. Increased customer satisfaction – because customers love well-designed products that give them what they need and want (and what they don’t know they need and want).
	- 3. Lower support costs – because pre-empting so many likely user problems via UX techniques lowers the company’s costs.
	- 4. Reduced development waste – which increases development efficiency and thus saves money in the development phase.
	- 5. Reduced risk of building the wrong thing – User research is a tool to find out what your customers will find to be the most usable and valuable things. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdj7ffjg0smz46wswb0az8))

	- Like the PM / PO boundary, there can be considerable overlap between the PM and UX roles. At the best digital companies, these roles collaborate with each other daily. They join forces to ensure that what they are creating is valuable and usable for customers. The difference between them is often at the detailed level. Product Managers are not typically responsible for UI design, while UX researchers and designers don’t dive deeply into the business viability of their products.

	- Four Data Team Archetypes The data teams at your company typically break into four types of roles. It’s very helpful for you to know the difference so that you can figure out who to work with for what purpose. Some people have more than one of these characteristics and well-staffed data science teams have all four. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmamjfbzmvp6t451cbkhqf))
		- 1. Data Detectives understand how to get the data to help stakeholders answer their questions and develop strategy. • Examples – market researchers, User Experience Research • They use tools like Qualtrics or Survey Monkey, or academic research sources. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmatgjmr5edb5t69drmnkn))
		- 2. Data Guardians build databases and understand their data dictionaries, perhaps managing a data warehouse. • Examples – Database Administrators (DBAs). Database administration is an operational or technical function responsible for physical database design, security enforcement, and database performance. Tasks include maintaining the data dictionary, monitoring performance, and enforcing organizational standards and security. • Their tooling is often based on SQL, a common language for managing data held in a relational database. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmaym3vga38r87qbtk4p14))
		- 3. Data Wranglers are typically programmers who build automation to pull data from APIs and databases. They may also build and run advanced analytical models. • Example – Data Engineers and Statisticians • Data Wranglers work in code – nowadays this is frequently Python. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmbbcasstf2x3dzf6gzf9z))
		- 4. Data Storytellers know how to translate complex data into digestible information. As the name suggests, they know how to use data to tell a story, • Example –Marketing Manager • They use tools such as Tableau or presentation tools like PowerPoint. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmbfpwymazwz79cqk2n9mr))
	- As a digital product manager, data detective and data storyteller skills are very valuable. It matters less if you can write SQL queries if you know how to ask great questions and what data is likely to answer these. And using data to illustrate stories is essential for PMs to communicate effectively and enroll fellow employees, teammates and management. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmbwzrjs35vd886cqq9nf3))
	- Product Management, UX and Engineering work together symbiotically in the digital organization. Much of this collaboration is driven by the structure of the Agile teams. But it’s critical that these three roles collaborate in Discovery, beyond the standard Agile rituals. This is because they are collectively responsible for defining and validating Product-Market Fit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmdkxpdxnjr5mj7b6v0egj))
	- Each role has a collaborative and overlapping mission, with Product Management ultimately responsible for the entire value proposition. PM and UX work closely together on the user research and human-centered design processes to understand the user problems and prototype solutions. UX and Engineering work together to define how to solve problems for users and determine which solutions are feasible to produce.

	- The DPM as Change Agent As you now know, leading change and making decisions are essential for successful digital transformation and execution. The first is strategic, the second is tactical – they are interlocked. Every company and product has to ‘pivot’ to some degree so the DPM has to facilitate both effectively.

	- Effective Meetings and Decision-Making
		- Two things kill productivity and velocity like nothing else: Meetings and re-making already-made decisions. For Digital Products, ‘moving fast’ means we must make decisions fast – BUT - as of 2015, we conduct somewhere between 36M-56M meetings in the US / day, and up to 50% of these meetings are a waste of time, costing at least $37B per year! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxry7r0g56shcsr0xxxm9pm))
	- Use this framework to streamline and kill the time-wasting things that kill your productivity: 1. Do we really need to meet? [[Q - How to run a meeting]]
		- Fewer and shorter meetings – try 15- or 30-min meetings where you used to have 60- mins. Start on time! Plan to end 5 minutes early if you can.
		- Standups vs ‘Status’ – Daily Standups aren’t just for your sprint team! Many executive staff do the same thing. 15 mins in the morning to focus – then go get it done.
		- Publish status, issues, plans – don’t fill a room to talk about it. 2. Before you meet, prepare!
		- Publish meeting purpose and agenda with times and owners. Decisions to be made, by who.
		- Send pre-reading ahead, e.g. your background or supporting data. Give people enough time to read it so they can come prepared to support your ask or have prepared questions and comments. This is an agreement.
		- Invite empowered attendees – sometimes the right decision makers can’t be there – negotiate decision proxies. 3. During and After, make it stick! • Have your recommendations ready – don’t ask ‘what should we do?’ • Publish / waterfall outcomes – so nobody can claim ‘they didn’t know’ or having to meet again for the same purpose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxryedzc1c1w6epsgecebyj))
	- DACI is a tool to help organizations assign responsibilities and make decisions. There are 4 possible roles within the DACI framework:
		- Driver - 1 person driving the decision to closure. The ‘point’ person.
		- Approver - 1-2 people approving the decision. Generally, the executive paying for it.
		- Contributor - Provides information or implements the decision.
		- Informed - Notified but not part of the decision process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxrxte03fhce8xpp1p1t3p0))
	- Both DACI and RACI frameworks can be used when an organization needs to document who has the final authority to make a decision. The tendency is for a lot of people being able to say no and no one person clearly being able to say yes – and having it stick. There are 4 options in DACI, and unlike RACI, one person can only have ONE setting. They can drive the decision forward, they can approve of a decision, they can contribute to a decision, or they can be Informed about a decision. This makes the DACI framework generally preferable to the RACI. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxrzak54sky6kqbz8g1a0qm))
	- Definitions: Outcomes and Output
		- In our work as DPMs, we can end up very focused on managing projects – shipping on time, on budget. Obviously, it’s very important to our success to get products out the door. As important as project management is, we are not project managers. We are focused on ensuring product-market fit, in other words, on the success of the business through providing value to customers. Instead of measuring our work by the projects we ship (‘output’), we need to measure our work by the ‘outcomes’ we create as a result of what we ship. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxrzyrfaeyc8khgq166zav8))
	- There are two types of outcomes we focus on as product managers.
		- Business Outcomes are measurable company goals, for instance Monthly Recurring Revenue. We sometimes call these metrics Key Performance Indicators. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxs0awfxwxz1mq88vzwvz4b))
		- Product Outcomes are the actual changes in human behavior that result from the changes to our products. These often revolve around measuring usage of our products or some aspects of our products. As product managers, the mechanism by which we influence those business outcomes is typically by causing product outcomes to happen. If more people use our features, we see better business outcomes as a result. If more people click on a ‘buy now’ button, we generate more revenue. So, Output is just an event that triggers these more sustained product and business outcomes. It is not in and of itself the goal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxs0zhgdmdmystmxhvb66yq))
	- OKRs are a type of SMART Goals that are written in a specific format, with some special characteristics.
		- OKRs are divided into Objectives – or strategic goals– and Key Results – or measurements of progress towards the goal. An Objective is an overarching theme of what you want to accomplish, usually qualitative. According to Google – veteran users of OKRs - you should use expressions that convey endpoints and states, such as “climb the mountain,” “eat 5 pies,” “ship feature Y.” They should be inspirational statements - written in the language likely to inspire your team. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxt8pm8983bzfsaf389pjr4))
	- **Key results should be quantitative metrics or at least a measurable milestone on the way to your objective.** **They are the “target” that you seek, not a task.** As Google suggests, **“Key results should describe outcomes, not activities.”** KRs answer whether you succeeded in achieving the objective.
	  id:: f548306d-dc50-45bb-9564-694c1fe0e69e
		- For example, your team may have a 2020 Objective that reads “Launch an amazing product that blows our customers’ minds”. Key Q1 results for this Objective could be: 1. 20% of trials convert to purchase in the first month. 2. Average user rating of 8/10 “would recommend”. 3. Customers use the product an average of 5x per week. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxt9bf1y8dhpg3takafargq))
	- **The primary purpose of OKRs is to create alignment in the organization. To do so, OKRs should be public to all company levels. OKRs are meant to be more flexible and lightweight than static annual planning. If a company is always reaching 100% of its goals, they are too easy.** OKRs are meant to be bold and ambitious, which means that some portion are “moonshots” with a high degree of risk. To enable ambitious goal-setting, OKRs should be decoupled from compensation and promotion. They are a management tool, not an employee evaluation tool! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxt9s4re2r7ae36q57b3a8s))
	  id:: cf0f8cf4-bdc9-4f4b-9218-71e6bb901297
	- As we learned, OKRs are useful for planning where you are going. In order to measure how fast you have been traveling and whether you are on course, your business needs KPIs. KPI is a common abbreviation meaning “Key Performance Indicator.” But don’t let that fool you – KPIs are just the metrics your company considers important. KPIs are based on the data your company collects from customer activity, including both economic activity and actions performed in your products themselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxtbq3m8awzdg1vythegkkr))
	- KPIs come in roughly two categories
		- Product and Business. Product KPIs measure whether customers are using and getting value from our product. They can provide leading indicators of success that determine whether your business will succeed in the next month, quarter or year. Succeeding with users of your product should lead to success in the business.
		- Business KPIs are described as “lagging” because they reflect a business result that may have been a long time in the making. This is especially true with B2B products. Whatever type of business you are in, monitoring Product KPIs can show you trouble brewing with users and let you fix it before it becomes an issue for the business. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxva8hhjvd9fpr2fv9rt63z))
	- Here are six indicators of User Engagement, or whether users find value in a product or service. These KPIs correspond to the following questions:
	  id:: a3bc5d5b-7806-48d2-87aa-ba50e4ba110c
		- Breath - How many active users do we have? For B2B, this could be how many users per paying customer?
		- Depth - How much of our product do they use? Are they using only 20% of our features? Which ones? Frequency - How often do users login or visit? All day, once a week? Once a month? Who (and which groups) logs in when?
		- Efficiency/Usability - How hard is it to complete tasks? Where do users get stuck?
		- Paths & Funnels - What do they do, in what order? Often, there is more than one way to accomplish a task. What’s the most-common way so we can optimize our user journey?
		- Feedback – how well did that new feature you just tried work? What can we do on this screen to make this feature work better? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxvb9tkmfqmzygsvt3gzh8n))
	- DEPTH is about measuring key features / functions rather than users and is expressed accordingly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxvcpr0arky6n92f1mpak7s))

		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674965301932_0.png)
	- BREADTH measures the number of users in a given time period. This includes the popular metrics of Daily Active Users (or DAU) and Monthly Active Users (or MAU). DAU/MAU is the ratio of daily active users divided by monthly active users, expressed as a percentage.
	  id:: 63d69a58-8d71-4b35-869e-504ee9b71f0f
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674965321127_0.png)
		- DAU/MAU is considered a better gauge than either number alone, as it measures a relative level of retention as well as pure usage. Consumer apps that reach greater than 20% DAU/MAU are considered to have good engagement, while 50% and more is considered world-class. Think apps like Facebook or Twitter, often accessed many times per day by users. A “good” DAU/MAU ratio – and usage breadth in general - is contextual based on your product. Tax prep products are very valuable and lucrative, but may only get used at certain times in the year, making DAU meaningless in, say, August. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxvdfqsxm42ync0hmv55n77))
	- Frequency helps fill in the picture of your active users by telling you **how often they are using your app and for how long**. In that sense, Frequency can provide a truer sense of the value your customers are deriving. Conversely, **time spent in app (or multiple logins per user) could indicate usability or learnability issues** if customers are spending more time than desired in your app, or have to log in repeatedly to get their jobs done.

	- A powerful feature of some product analytics tools is the ability to visualize ”funnels” or paths in your product. A funnel is a series of steps (events) that a user takes to accomplish something in your product. **You can report out across users to see common paths and variations, whether users tend to complete or abandon tasks, and the average time it takes them.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxvg7z2qnhcaxth45rvcmsy))

	- Customer sentiment is another type of metric that is related to both the product and the business. **Many companies use Net Promoter Scores to measure customer sentiment.** NPS typically measures the WHOLE product – the entire company as well as the specific products. NPS has become somewhat controversial in recent years, for two primary reasons:
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674965444133_0.png)
		- It asks about future likely behavior rather than measuring actual observed behavior – which is the gold standard.
		- There is minimal data proving a causal relationship between NPS and business success. Some companies now favor other direct measures of customer satisfaction and referrals. But NPS is still an extremely common way of evaluating customer satisfaction, assuming that only customers who are wildly satisfied will provide word-of-mouth marketing for your business. What better time to ask customers than while they’re in your product, using it? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxwh3p2fchxrrsbrw934t4m))
	- Annual Contract Value (ACV) isn’t necessarily a valuable metric by itself, but it becomes super important when compared against other aspects such as the number of active customers. If you compare ACV to Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), you can see how long it takes to pay back the cost of acquiring a customer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxwj6t3e5zq4qyscr6g1be1))
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674966533161_0.png)
		- Quiz: You have 100 customers on a monthly plan @ $1,000. What is the average ACV for your customer base? (Answer: 100 cust * $1000 * 12 mos /100 cust = still $12,000!) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxwkf7astm4j9szhxdnmcgv))
	- ARR and MRR are important to Digital Businesses because they enable financial forecasting. MRR in particular is a close-to-real-time measure of growth. If your contracts are annualized, you can calculate ARR regardless of whether you bill annually, monthly or both. If contracts run on a monthly basis, you should use MRR. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxwjrmd8n36w5h60587gd2x))
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674966552785_0.png)
		- Focus on the subscription revenue you can rely on through the life of a contract. One-time revenue such as from training shouldn’t count towards ARR calculations because it doesn’t repeat. Quiz: You have 100 customers on a monthly plan @ $300 / month. What is the total ARR and MRR for your customer base? (Answer: 100 cust * $300 / month = $30,000 MRR and $360,000 ARR) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxwk4gange07asy897fvrw4))
	- **ARPA / ARPU help you understand how much you need to scale your business to succeed.** Low ARPA means you’ll need to acquire a lot of individual customers to break $1M ARR. If you have lower volume, it also means you need to operate your business in a lower-cost fashion in order to turn a profit, such as reducing expensive customer acquisition tactics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxwm08mkv8s89mq233hyb4h))
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675043092215_0.png)
		- ARPA is a lagging metric that improves when you are doing things right. When you know your customers well, price at the right level and sell effectively, ARPA should increase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxxp3t53b1217atqw6vde4s))
		- As we mentioned, low ARPA means you need a higher volume of customers to meet revenue goals. Spreading your revenue across a lot of customers can also reduce the risk of losing any individual customer. Smaller customers also tend to accept your standard product as is, which can make life easier for product management. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxxqwbmbwhj3vdk0z13nqkr))
		- High ARPA concentrates your revenue in the hands of just a few large customers. B2B and especially enterprise software companies tend to focus a lot on ‘Elephants’, which can be problematic as they often demand customized products. Supporting Elephant customers and their hundreds or thousands of users can also be a major drain on profitability. Winning Elephants takes a lot of work and can cost a lot of money. Losing them really hurts. On the other hand, it can be worth it for the revenue and reference-ability of major customers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxxqyhwxh94wdgcwdjcfz4g))

	- LTV is the predicted amount a customer will spend with you thru your relationship. LTV helps you move from transaction-based thinking to the long-term value of repeat business. Lifetime value is somewhat more complex to calculate, so we won’t practice it here. However, it’s one of the most important metrics for you to track. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxxsmcwtqysq5e053w2tz0v))\
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674967800079_0.png)
		- Calculating LTV requires several component metrics such as recurring revenue and churn rate. LTV is especially valuable when matched with the cost of acquiring a customer. If you know how much a customer’s value will be over the course of a lifetime, then you can make smarter decisions about what to spend on them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxxt4nv6vdncdc0r98dpqg1))
	- Money that’s spent convincing a customer to make a purchase is called the Customer Acquisition Cost. In order to be profitable, at the simplest level, customer acquisition cost will need to be lower than customer lifetime value, since you need to make more money than you spend acquiring the customer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxy16xzcjdgv4ptcn3x5nmt))
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674968042326_0.png)
		- The LTV-to-CAC ratio is one of the most important KPIs in digital business, as it is the length of time to reach CAC breakeven. You need to be making enough money on your customers to justify the cost of acquiring them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxy2j02kda362tjf8hdbh07))
		- A well-tested rule of thumb says: you should aim for LTV to be 3x your CAC, and you should recover CAC within one year of the sale. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqxy32rvh0572nedz3wenjkj))
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674968118097_0.png)
	- Churn of paying customers has a direct effect on customer LTV. If you can halve your churn rate, it will double your LTV. Churn is often caused by low customer satisfaction, which can be a leading indicator. For this reason, you should keep tabs on customer satisfaction using customer surveys and Net Promoter Scores to try to head off churn before it occurs. If your business runs on longer term contracts, another key metric to focus on is renewals. A single-digit improvement in Churn can make a huge difference in renewals.

			- Too hard to use
			- Lack of usage
			- Customers feeling ignored

		- Design Thinking is another Value Loop ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr06kgn2b9srg34n35datx85))
		- The 5 Phases of Design Thinking
		  1. Empathize with your users.
		  2. Define your users’ needs, their problem, and your insights.
		  3. Ideate by challenging assumptions and creating ideas for innovative solutions.
		  4. Pretotype to start considering solutions.
		  5. Test see whether those solutions meet standards to continue developing them as
		  products. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr078sc1k0mkf0hp5x5ep3jk))
		- ((20f2f596-c58f-40b7-aee7-96a36a28d487))
		- Even though design thinking is fundamentally a qualitative Discovery process – testing and validation are built into this. You don’t stop after you define your ideas. You need to get back in the market and validate the value of your ideas with the use of prototypes. The phases deliberately end with “Test.” Design thinking doesn’t get you all the way to a product. Instead, it validates an opportunity and gives you a strong head start on how that opportunity could be addressed. Be sure to consider in advance what “success” will mean. What outcome will tell you that you can provide value – and thus move forward to create a product? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr08a8xa98he6g51vaxa681j))

		- One technique that you must master as a DPM is the art of the interview. We are not asking you to interrogate them; the biggest mistake most PMs make is asking biased or leading questions in search of validating the thing we already believe to be true. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr08eerbsbe9hpwrvhfzrqbg))
		- The best interviews use a combination of active listening and open-ended questions. The concept is that you reflect back (and maybe paraphrase) the speaker’s words to them so that they agree that you heard and understood what they said. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr08em75yagfx8s0yknz1133))
		- Part two of this skill set is asking the open-ended question – this is a question without a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. These two techniques can change not only your life as a PM, but also other aspects of work and even home life. When a customer answers your question, be prepared to follow their lead: Use the phrases “Tell me more” to take the conversation to a deeper level. After completing the interviews, debrief with your team on your Learnings and Themes. Learnings are the recollections of what stood out during a conversation or observation: direct quotes, anecdotes, notes on body language. Learnings should be captured in full sentences to capture the story. Themes are created after you have organized the stories from your field research into categories. Did you hear similar statements or observations from multiple people? Themes are the headlines for clusters of similar learnings.

	- Expanding the Customer Circle to the Value Prop Canvas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5ffxrt6d3fymfaa7b9thcz))
	- In the last unit, we learned about the value prop canvas, a useful model for analyzing customer jobs, in particular the customer circle. We covered the importance of understanding who the customer is, and then we dove deeply into the jobs they are trying to accomplish. We now add the value prop box to create the full Value Prop Canvas. The box on the left gives us a framework to go from the customer and their problems to creating a solution. In our innovation work, we start on the right side and then move to the left. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5fgacw4xq674872641rbxz))
	- The Value Prop Box helps you ideate solutions to enable your customers’ Jobs to be Done. For the Gain Creators box, consider How might we improve or increase the benefits our customer expects, desires or would be surprised by? These could be Functional / Utility, serving Basic needs, and/or Social gains, or Positive emotions - - Before, During, and After getting the job done. For the Pain Relievers Box, consider: How might we eliminate or reduce negative emotions, costs, situations, and risks that your customer experiences.

	- ‘Pretotype’ is not a typo! The concept was developed by Alberto Savoia of Google and fully developed in his book The Right It. Prototypes try to get to the core of questions around building a product, will it work well and what will it cost to make. They ask the question: "CAN we make this?" Pretotypes focus on working out if it is worth building in the first place! Does anyone want us to solve this problem, and will they pay to solve it? They ask the question: "SHOULD we make this?" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5fkqvmvzbdpj74rfcajhdb))
	- If you conduct research only by reading articles or talking with ‘experts’, you will at best gain some 3rd party opinions on whether your idea has a chance of success. This is known as OPD ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5g4xzgj3sax8b6216ab0jz))

	- This pre-testing is one of the most compelling aspects of what Pretotyping offers: knowing whether your intended audience will want something before you've invested millions in making it. Making a product which works well is difficult enough, but creating one which people actually want to use is even more valuable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5g5675cpvgxx3bvv80zz7t))

		- Concierge test – a service offered manually to validate the value of solving a particular problem. Wealthfront, for instance, initially created a concierge test to provide wealth management advice and portfolio management. They would sit with customers, pen and paper in hand, and figure out solutions to wealth management issues, step by step. Of course, it was not scalable – but it didn’t have to be to prove out the value.
		- Wizard of Oz – similar to a concierge test, except that the humans performing a service are hidden so the user believes the service is automated.
		- Landing Pages – web pages that potential customers can visit so the people testing an idea can collect data on searches, page clicks and/or registrations – without an actual product to back it up • Explainer Videos – videos that describe the value of a potential product
		- Crowdfunding – an opportunity for potential customers to invest up front based on a future value proposition • Storyboards – these can be similar to explainer videos in that they illustrate how a product will solve a customer problem. They are quick and easy to create and can be used internally ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5g5gycj1w4pdmdh91askw4)) to gain alignment and buy-in, or externally to ask potential customers “does this describe your problem and a solution that you might want?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5g5m5crwb0r6njc7wfpc3e))
	- Build a Storyboard to tell a Story ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5g661jtf9meq9rfsrjzbhv))
		- Storyboarding is a UX tool which help you visually predict and explore a user’s experience with a product. It’s as if your potential customer were starring in a movie about their problems, in which a solution comes in to save the day. It helps stakeholders understand the benefits of a solution and how it could work in practice. A foundational Human-centered design approach. Stories put a human face on data. Storyboards bring solutions to life, so that teams can walk in the shoes of their users and see solutions as their users see them.

	- Product Market Fit Triad: Feasibility ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5g7we4qdfe5jy1cvqwpgrx))
		- To assess both feasibility and viability – you need some idea of technical design. Recall, Feasible asks: Can we make this work, and work well? ‘Technology’ means our technical solution. But Feasibility can also include legal / regulatory requirements we have to meet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5g895n1qm81yn0z9sg6s3d))

	- Product Market Fit Triad: Viability
	  Viability asks: Is this opportunity economically attractive to pursue? Can we make enough money doing this? Should we do this??
	  Typical Viability questions include:
	  • How large is the market and how much of it can we capture?
	  • How much revenue - and in what timeframe?
	  • Who do we charge, for what and how much?
	  • What will it cost to build and deliver?
	  • Who do we need relationships with?
	  • What supporting activities are required? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5g8ss9cpeph4qxyyz11wn8))
	- Viability and Cost Estimation – Cost Estimates are generated by considering time, labor and other fixed / variable costs to get a product to market. However, most early engineering estimates of major projects are wrong. Estimating accuracy varies greatly by the size of work, familiarity of the team, and other factors. Estimates at the early stage are approximate-only – you should leave a lot of ‘wiggle room’. ‘T-shirt-sizes’ are often used for early project costs by engineering. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5g9144q5gbczrty1tr08ed))
	- Market Segmentation
		- You can’t serve all potential customer needs with the same product. Segmentation is the process of taking the vast world of potential customers and breaking them down into smaller unique groups with similar needs which are likely to react the same way to your marketing and to your product. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gbb54kymevngf265wwh9x))
		- It’s important to develop the right product for your target market segment, and that you invest your marketing money effectively. Selected segments determine what marketing programs, messages and activities are used to reach that target group. For example, beer is targeted differently at males in their 20s than women in their 30s. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gbpyx6ebvksexv7yw8bfq))
	- Segment by market needs, not by product feature. Customers buy for a variety of reasons.
	  Here are some common Consumer-specific Segmentation Criteria:
	  • Geographic
	  • Demographic (Age, gender, income, education, health..)
	  • Psychographics: Values, attitudes and lifestyles
	  • Vertical: Interest, expertise ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gnbkzjahha537jkeh52b7))
	- Consumers buy for a variety of reasons. For example, if you sell luxury cars, you need to understand the emotional pull of a new car and the psychological benefit it gives the buyer. Each psychographic segment considers purchases differently depending on their aspirations and goals, not just their income. For example, in spite of limited budgets, some less-affluent segments may be more inclined to buy brand name products because buying store brand products makes them feel poor. It’s worth the emotional boost to buy the brand. Every purchase has an emotional aspect and you need to figure out what that is for each of your segments.

	- Value Proposition 101
	  id:: fc25a520-98c5-4d88-a7dc-2eb208da0450
	  A Value Proposition is a concise statement that summarizes how you’ve uniquely solved an important problem for a specific group of people. It signals to prospective buyers that:
	  • They’re not alone
	  • A solution to their problem exists
	  • Only you offer it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gq3xnpab8bse0ed0tyw82))

The Lean Canvas replaces elaborate business plans with a single- page business model. Business plans have historically taken too long to write, are seldom updated, and often are never read. However, documenting your plan is key. Lean Canvas attempts to resolve this conflict by replacing long and boring business plans with a one-page model that takes a few minutes to create - and actually gets read and maintained!

	- Recall: An MVP is a new product that is developed with sufficient value to satisfy early adopters – who by definition are not already customers. Typically, an MVP does not replace a prior version of the same product. A Minimum Business Increment is the smallest piece of functionality that can be delivered to existing customers which provides value to those customers and to the business ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5gzbrpnmj3a3jxzvbnsrnj))

	  • Provides valuable feedback that the right functionality is being built - and that it is being
	  built in the right way
	  • Enhances the ability of the organization to deliver value in the future
	  • Contains all of the pieces required for value realization. This includes any work required by

	- • Improvements to Platforms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5h018j8f0n8rnjsqnkc3w8))
	- Use “MVP” with Care - MVP is the minimum functionality to learn from visionary early adopters. Visionary customers can fill in the gaps on missing features - if the product solves a real problem. MVP is a concept that originated in the lean startup methodology introduced by Eric Ries in 2011. In general, the lean startup focuses on the influence of testing and learning on new product development. And MVP encapsulates that approach perfectly. MVP is about Validated Learning! It may not necessarily be a “product release”. “Viable” can be extensive for mature products and existing customers. Building an MVP requires a commitment to iterate! MVP or Minimum Viable Product is a term we love, and love to hate. Minimal – doesn’t mean crippled, lacking, unreliable or non-functional! Rather, it means: “what’s the smallest & fastest-to-deliver chunk of value we can deliver, right now, that will thrill customers so much, that they will buy it now and wait for the other stuff.” MVP should certainly be good enough that’s it’s worth paying for- so you can ‘Earn while you Learn’ or the converse. This is the real test of MVP ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5h0cxxehhgp6j25mgjpnbd))

In a subscription business, you collect revenue over months or years. You need to make sure you’re making enough money per customer on average to make it “worth it” to spend on acquiring them. Otherwise, you need to find ways to make this ratio more favorable, either by reducing CAC or increasing LTV. Optimizing your pricing can allow you to exceed both goals.

	- Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Analysis is an analysis technique for determining price preferences, introduced in the 70’s by the eponymous Dutch economist. It has been a staple for setting pricing for the past 20 years. It consists of a survey with four questions that ask: ‘at what price would you consider the product to be:’ • Priced so low that you would feel the quality couldn’t be very good? (Too cheap) • So expensive that you won’t consider buying it? (Too expensive) • Starting to get expensive, not out of the question, but you have to give some thought to buying it? (Expensive/High Side) • A bargain—a great buy (Cheap/Good Value) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjckhpvn32vxf4aydrjmn0f))
	- This is a typical van Westendorp analysis graph, with price point on the x-axis and % of respondents on the y-axis. The optimal price is determined by the span on the Price Point axis between where the “too cheap” and “on the high side” plotlines cross the “good value” and “too expensive” plotlines. You want your pricing to fall where customers find value from your product, don’t consider it too cheap, but still consider it a good deal.

	- All Revenue is Not the same It is said that ‘all revenue is good revenue’, but the reality is more nuanced. Revenue is typically collected in either or both of the following two ways: One-Time Revenue, and Recurring Revenue. There are advantages to each. One-time revenue (OTR) provides two advantages: 1. Faster growth. You’re charging a one-time fee, so you can charge more - which gives you more immediate money to invest in growth. 2. Bigger margins. “Some companies would kill to have the dollars of contribution margin over 12 months that a non-recurring business gets on its first transaction,” says Rob Go, co- founder and Partner at NextView.

	- Those with SaaS solutions usually prefer a recurring revenue or subscription model. Recurring
	  revenue is often more desirable for three reasons:
	  1. Better Predictability. Customers paying you now are more likely to keep paying you in the future.
	  2. More multiples. There are more stable metrics which makes it easier to calculate the value of the business in multiple ways.
	  3. Higher lifetime value. Because you’re providing value over time, the customer will do the same for you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjds8d2saqcs0m9cqf4zd44))
	- For many companies, it makes financial sense to convert products with One-Time prices to lower but recurring pricing. Business customers may well prefer the greater predictability of the recurring price – even if they ultimately wind up paying more over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjdspt58nerrhqw6phhhy72))
	- The key point here is not that one type of revenue is always better than the other – but that you need to model both approaches and determine what is the right long-term mix for your business. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjdtj55y3axgmzxg49mbeq9))
	- Per-user Pricing? Don’t be stuck in the past. Per-user pricing is a relic of the 1980s & 90’s – back when software providers had few ways to track what customers were doing in their products and limited ability to slice their products up by functional areas. To compensate for this, some vendors relied on licensing schemes that locked software to a specific PC, so only that user could use the software. Later, companies created licensing schemes that allowed for more flexibility, but often they still charged a set fee for all features, per user. This practice is still common today. After all, it’s easy. You can count each user and issue a single license per user, without worrying about segmenting or offering user-specific bundles of functionality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjdxgbzktbzn7zf4jd6d4wx))
	- Per-user pricing, however, is rarely how your customers experience the value of your product. In B2B software, some users are likely to use some functions but not others. They may have very different needs from one another – some using your product every day and others only checking in occasionally. We now have capabilities that allow us fine-grained access control and usage monitoring & metering. Given this, it’s often better to create tiers or packages to match what your users actually need, and price them according to the value different users derive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjdxnza8atc2a9y2ktcb2x1))
	- Throttling user access also makes your product less sticky. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjdxw1h2dbzhj8czhar8n2d))
	- In summary, for most products you’re building right now, it doesn’t really matter how many users are using the product. Rather, value comes from the number of tests completed, the number of files stored, or even the amount of bandwidth or visitors analyzed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjdy7pbq6z12cv9mz8f389q))
	- Cost-plus pricing - With cost-plus pricing, your selling price is set by evaluating all variable costs your company incurs and adding a markup percentage to establish your price. It’s entirely inwardly focused and doesn’t represent what your customers think or feel. So, why use cost-plus pricing? • PLUS: It’s simple. As long as you know how much your costs are, it’s trivial to work out your price. No market research, no data analysis, no strategizing. Just some addition and percentages. • PLUS: You will cover your costs. As this is cost-plus pricing, you know that you will be adding a certain margin on top of your costs as pure profit. • NEGATIVE: Customers don’t care about cost; they care about value. You may be leaving money on the table or, conversely, pricing a product higher than they are willing to pay. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjdywv2we6eehrzkwskarv5))

	- Competitor-based pricing - Utilizes competitor prices as a benchmark, rather than setting a price based on you own company’s costs or customer value. Why base your pricing on what your competitors charge? • PLUS: It’s simple. By spending 30 minutes on competitors’ sites you can have a “pricing strategy.” By placing yourself in the middle of the pack, future customers may not think your product is too cheap or too expensive. • PLUS: It might be close to optimal: If you’re in a competitive market, competitor pricing may already be optimized for your type of offering. • NEGATIVE: you don’t develop your own pricing strategy – you copy Theirs. Your company exists to offer customers something different from what is already on the market. If you’re not differentiated in some meaningful way, you should not build it. The moral of the competitor-based story is ‘look, but don’t touch.’ You want to know how your competitors are pricing their products so that you’re in the same ballpark - but they should not be guiding your decisions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjfa6k1pgtzdpg892wktgyz))
	- Value-Based Pricing - means pricing based on how much target consumers believe a product is worth. Make no mistake: pricing this way takes more work. You must really know your customers and what is important to them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjfam8bk40694rjc4t6r76t))

	- What is a Value Metric? In order to price your product effectively, the first thing you need to do is determine your value metric. Your value metric is the thing you charge for in your product. It has 3 vital characteristics: 1. It aligns to your customer’s needs 2. It’s easy to understand 3. It grows with your customers use, creating win/win for both parties Value metrics should be tuned to what your TARGET customers will pay for. Here are two examples of companies who price according to clear value metrics ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjfb4g26afhynw4trdvy3j9))

	- Value Metrics for IT & Internal Projects
	  Value metrics aren’t just for external customer-facing products! For internal projects, you
	  should use value metrics as evidence of the value delivered to your internal customers.
	  Examples of internal value metrics include:
	  • RevRec’ acceleration
	  • Implementation cycle time, error, cost reduction
	  • Support cycle time or ticket reduction
	  • Headcount reduction or re-allocation
	  • Other CapEx, OpEx spend
	  These metrics allow you to clearly communicate the value of your project and align the benefits to the organization asking for the investment to 
	  deliver them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqnhzavvevybhf1c5x7y2hp))
	- The Value Proposition is your clear message about your offering. It should define your product and explain its target market, the primary benefit to customers and what makes it different from competitors. For example, Facebook’s paying customers are advertisers, so their value proposition is 100% advertiser-facing, something along the lines of “The most surgically targeted ad campaigns on planet earth.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqnk8yj1g761bdpr7pgm06y))
	- The Revenue Streams box captures how you will charge for your product – and specifically your value metric[s]. Remember that for a business to sustain itself, value must always be captured somewhere. Some companies offer value freely to some customer segments because they can charge for value provided to customers in another segment with greater willingness to pay. For example, as of mid-2020, Facebook has attracted more than 2.7B users who don’t pay anything to use it - because FB sells advertising (and some personal user information) to companies who want to target these 2.7B users. This is a good reminder that if you’re not paying for the product you MIGHT BE the product! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqnmcmv4ae3mha40jh493rn))
	- Usage-based Pricing Once we’ve developed our Value Metric, there are several ways we can charge customers for it. We define usage-based pricing as: A pricing model in which the amount that a customer pays is determined by how much or how many of something a customer uses. There are four common ways to price by usage: 1**. Flat-Tiered Subscription Pricing** - A very common form of SaaS usage-based pricing. Even if you are charging a flat rate for each “tier”, the goal of tiers is generally the same: Small customers pay less than medium customers, and large customers pay more than medium customers. 2. **Flat Subscription + Overages** - The 2-part tariff has become a popularized pricing model. With this model, a customer pays a flat subscription which gives them an ‘allotment’ of usage. If a user exceeds this usage, they are charged for additional usage. Studies show that this model can increase revenue by as much as 15%. 3. Flat Subscription + Usage - With this model, your company charges for a base subscription fee, and then for any additional usage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqnmxn3tnngv4gpswrvjwhy))
	- 4. Linear Pricing - Contrary to some myths, it’s actually one of the simplest usage-based pricing models. With this model, the cost to the consumer is purely consumption based. Customers only pay when they use your product. This model can sometimes be referred to as pay-as-you-go or consumption-based pricing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqnn10metf7qxhy8yjhhah2))
	- Packaging – the other essential part of Pricing
		- Packaging your product in different configurations is an essential part of delivering your product. Your packaging reflects a pre-assembled grouping of features which reflect segmentation, and provides: 1. Targeted Value for specific Personas & Segments – pre-selected bundles of features which deliver no more and no less than what segment values most. Want the sports bundle? The movie bundle? The news bundle? Then, order that package. 2. Convenience – take the friction out of customers buying just what they need with fewer clicks & trips to the store. 3. Oppty for Cross-sell & Up-sell – once the customer has found value with what they’ve purchased , they’re more likely to buy other packages from you. 4. A ‘fence’ against value leaks – don’t give away what customers are willing to pay for! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqnstcbxsk2nzkdwvcdj15m))

	- Core Principles of Agile ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqp0k0tf83sjs5187y619k2))
	- Agile is a development methodology focused on delivering iterative and incremental software in small slices so that you can inspect what you have done and decide what the next best thing to work on is. T ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqp0fgwhbqdqj8ev7c1nywa))
	- Agile focuses on small, self-organizing teams. This is very different from top-down
	  command and control management.
	  It tries to create opportunities for continuous communication & collaboration between team
	  members, customers, and stakeholders. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqp1z3km9ragkv516qkp35w))
	- There’s the iterative and incremental development. A key aspect of scrum is frequent
	  inspection of code and once the code has been inspected, adapt it to changing
	  circumstances. Teams deliver code in Iterations, typically of 1 – 4 weeks, with 2 weeks being
	  the most popular. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqp4thme08x6arbbbye4vgy))
	- It creates an environment of accountability. In self-organizing teams if you give them a task
	  then they are responsible for delivering the outcome and organizing how they are going to
	  achieve the outcome.
	  And trying to organize teams based on customer needs and company goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqp5033pp3rkexw282bjp2f))
	- Agile enables the Validation Cycle ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqp55ta0dg47f6hcjy3sh35))
	- Agile works great for the Digital PM because it enables the validation cycle. What you get
	  is great visibility as you work on thin slices of working software - and you can see what is really
	  going on. You get flexibility in decision-making and you get higher quality because it’s very
	  hard to do iterative and incremental development without building quality into that process. It
	  also reduces risk because you can build a lot more learning into the process throughout
	  development. You actually end up building product that people will use. And ultimately
	  deliver better return on investment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqphkd4nvd6b5w5cty86ze4))
	- Consider a product that was released as one large monolithic chunk or work at ‘Release 5’.
	  That would take a lot of time (think: many months). Instead, we can chunk all that work down
	  into 5 smaller iterations. After the ‘Release 1’ iteration is delivered, you’ll have a better sense of
	  what completed or remaining functionality will offer the most value.
	  After some more time, you get to the Release 3 iteration. A new opportunity or project may
	  have shown up - and your existing product might be meeting the needs of customers pretty
	  well at this point. If you were tied into building everything before you could release it, you
	  might well be doing work that wasn’t the highest priority for the company at that point. You
	  can change plan now and work on another opportunity and create better economic
	  opportunity for your company. We call this: ‘Delaying decision until last responsible
	  moment’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqpt4bxbmmhknrp7ay4fsvn))
	- SCRUM - Scrum could be called the framework for Agile software development. In many
	  people’s view, Scrum is synonymous with Agile. Scrum is, first and foremost, a managerial
	  framework. It's about things developers do when they're not writing code. Scrum explicitly
	  prescribes a model, according to which developers plan their work, update their plans, and
	  analyze how things went in retrospect. The framework introduces the role of Scrum Master, a
	  dedicated person whose task is to facilitate the process and make sure it’s being followed.
	  More on Scrum below. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqpthzmtrvztzkg24j7cjmr))
	- KANBAN - The Kanban framework was invented at Toyota, whose representatives observed
	  how supermarkets restock their goods based on what’s been picked off the shelves. This led
	  Toyota to create a supply system where production plans would be driven by actual
	  consumption. One of the key ideas of Kanban is to refrain from producing a surplus – and
	  to minimize Work in Process. The Kanban system also introduces the notion of "pull" over
	  "push," meaning that workers pull in work according to their capacity, as opposed to
	  work being fed to them on a conveyor belt or in the form of a to-do list. Another aspect of
	  Kanban development is that activities are always tied to customer needs and that there is
	  ongoing communication with the customer. Nothing is produced unless it economically
	  benefits the customer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqpv1c8q7k8kp0x5773vegw))
	- XP [Extreme Programming] - Extreme programming started as an experiment at Chrysler.
	  The idea was to take cherry-picked programming practices to the extreme and see what
	  happens. For instance, instead of code reviews, you do ‘pair-programming’, technically
	  reviewing code non-stop. Later, as more companies began adopting this approach, certain
	  rigid rules started to be omitted - such as daily integration tests. Nowadays, one can see XP
	  practices used by teams that utilize Scrum, Kanban, and other Agile methodologies to
	  squeeze the most out of the developers' potential. XP does not simply equal pair
	  programming. While pair programming is one the twelve practices used in XP, it’s not the only
	  one there is. XP offers an algorithm for process management, too. Another thing to note is
	  that ideally, all XP practices should be used together, or else they won't work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqpw0wbkrhkfwxrq15kmbha))
	- Lean Software Development – Lean was conceived in the '80s by adopting a "just-in-time"
	  approach, borrowed heavily from Kanban. You’ll see many similarities between the two
	  approaches. Like Kanban, Lean strives to reduce waste and maximize value to the
	  customer. Waste could be building the wrong feature, waiting/multitasking/switching,
	  wasting time doing something that will never be used or starting anew. Unlike Kanban, Lean
	  has some prescriptions regarding engineering practices (TDD, for example). At the same
	  time, Lean is less prescriptive on delivery time-boxes, with the team potentially being
	  ready to deploy at any time. Some other concepts frequently associated with Lean are the
	  Minimal Viable Product, which is the version you release as soon as you can - often even ahead
	  of writing any documentation - failing fast, and making binding commitments (such as main
	  architectural decisions) as late as possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqpw52vpp8ncxr5nchmq68n))
	- Definition of Done and Definition of Ready
	  These are both a team-agreed list of criteria which must be met before:
	  • DoR: User Stories can be accepted by the team to work on
	  • DoD: A product Increment is considered “done”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqpxckc963x5dqzkt3ygs4f))
	- An increment is “potentially releasable” if it adheres to the teams Definition of DONE. This
	  does not mean it will be released, but that it meets the standards, usually something to the
	  effect of what is built works, has been tested, has been documented, and checked in. Doth
	  definitions are intended to be light-weight written checklists, generally displayed prominently
	  wherever the team can see them, so they are clear and well-understood. Don’t obsess over
	  details – the point is to communicate expectations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqpxgbnwdjwz2xs04dcgj4x))
	- There can be variations on DOd. For example, ‘Done-Done’ can be used to specify that an
	  increment is to deploy in production, or is already available to customers. Again, simpler is
	  better. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqpxtd4nbx6b6fnn601nyr9))
	- The recommended team size is 7 to 9 people. There’s no harm in going smaller than 7, but
	  once you go above 9 communication can start to break down. And negative team dynamics
	  start to take place. If your team needs to do more, then the team needs to break into
	  additional, smaller teams. The Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are typically not
	  included in this count unless they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqq0dgvcaam5rz7bjxrkc25))
	- The Product Owner (PO) is responsible for managing the Product and Sprint Backlogs.
	  The PO helps facilitate Sprint Planning, Release Planning and also attends the team’s daily
	  standups. The PO writes and helps elaborate user stories & acceptance criteria, co-leads Sprint ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqq0j1cfdye0rjwff4a5y3w))
	- Reviews and participates in the Sprint Retrospective. The PO must also ensure that any stories
	  they put into the backlog meet the Definition of Ready so the team will accept them and
	  begin working on them. They also accept stories and iterations as complete, pursuant to the
	  teams Definition of Done. They are available to the team to clarify the product needs as
	  embodied in the User Stories, so the team doesn’t have to guess.
	  The Scrum Master (SM) is responsible for facilitating the work of the sprint team and
	  serving as a coach to team members. It is not uncommon for the SM to also be developer or
	  have another role on the team. But the SM does not run all the ceremonies – the does that.
	  Notably, the PO and the SM should never be the same person! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqq0p4bqh24sqnxx7v1gxzq))
	- Dual Track Agile, Continuous Discovery and Research Spikes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqq5akmxnk4n50j6h282rtw))
	- Discovery and Delivery are two very different complimentary processes. Traditional agile
	  focuses on making delivery high-quality and predictable in terms of timeframe and cost. This
	  leaves out the discovery work that we need to do in order to innovate, understand problems –
	  which is fundamentally messy and leads to some dead ends. The best way we’ve found to
	  solve this is to run both kinds of processes side-by-side. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqqgbx4ecdq0aaw1femgyrb))
	- Discovery is all about learning and validating your hypotheses. Continuous Discovery
	  interleaves these learning processes process side-by-side with Delivery processes. The
	  Best Practice is for the team to have weekly touchpoints with customers where they conduct
	  small research activities in pursuit of a desired Product Outcome. These frequent shorter
	  duration discussions have been shown to be far more effective than infrequent, large
	  research projects than can overwhelm your team. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqr1xvxbvvvdrrh05g5xr8j))
	- Sometimes, the team can’t estimate how hard a technical challenge will be to solve , or how
	  long it will take. A Research Spike allows the team to dedicate time, but ‘time-box’, or limit
	  that time they spend on researching or prototyping a solution. Said otherwise, the team
	  can break down a complex problem into smaller pieces which can be solved in one sprint. This
	  is very helpful for reducing technical risk. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqr7ysxsc533vp06r02ytaz))
	- Intro to Usability Testing
	  There are three benefits to Usability Testing:
	  1. Uncover problems in the design
	  2. Discover opportunities to improve the design
	  3. Learn about users’ behavior and preferences ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqr82ansgz0e479dmen7s78))
	- In a usability-testing session, a researcher (called a “facilitator” or a “moderator”) asks a
	  participant to perform tasks, usually using one or more specific user interfaces. While the
	  participant completes each task, the researcher observes the participant’s behavior and listens
	  for feedback. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqr8m0x32fqs8j8nq6szrfn))
	- Years of research and statistical analysis have helped us determine that 5 tests are generally
	  sufficient to identify all the issues you are likely to find while testing. Testing just 5 users
	  would turn up 85% of the problems in an interface. This conclusion is brought to you by
	  binomial probability, better known as the Poisson Distribution—which can show us the
	  chances of achieving n successes in N trials. The Poisson Distribution with a 31% binomial
	  probability shows that once you add more than 5 users to a test group, returns diminish
	  drastically—the more users you add to a test group, the less you’ll learn. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqr99qnkp0cmy5207nryqdw))
	- Storymaps and User Stories
	  A storymap is fundamentally telling the story of how a user accomplishes their goals in
	  your product. This technique is very helpful is for anyone who has ever struggled with a
	  backlog. Yes, backlogs for mature products can be all over the place. But, backlogs for
	  innovations need to align to a story.
	  A storymap serves as a bridge between product vision and product backlog. It enables
	  coherent MVP and future releases that accomplish user goals. Stories will often emerge from
	  building the map. It also helps create a shared understanding of the problem and solution for
	  the team and for stakeholders.
	  Two fundamental pieces of information must be combined to create a Story Map:
	  Personas - Representation of a group of customers with common behaviors ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqra664x7v652d3s93n0arq))
	- Persona Jobs / Goals - Key tasks or goals to be completed from the Customer perspective
	  A Story Map is also useful for high level prioritization and deciding what should and
	  should not be part of the Minimum viable product. The terms used with story mapping are
	  here too, for example the backbone, user activity, user tasks etc. Over time this has evolved
	  so that the bigger things are on the top and the smaller items with more detail are lower
	  down. What you need to do first is higher than what you will need to do later on. A task is
	  usually something that will be completed in a single session. Goals often happen in multiple
	  sessions.
	  Lastly, a Story Map really helps visualizing prioritization – far easier than reading through
	  pages of user stories. This help you when roadmapping. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqra9hwb23nzqbkbnwkyxzf))

	- A User Story is a high-level requirement that has just enough detail to allow developers to

	- Release Planning and Roadmaps ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqrzsewv5gpdgr4ps0h5pwn))
	- A Product Roadmap is the expression of your company’s strategy as a product vision. It is
	  about your products (including whole products – i.e. services). But it’s NOT a project plan, a
	  Gantt chart, or a promise of specific functionality on specific dates. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqs08py2gbat5jmgmd2c94f))
	- That said, roadmap and backlog are on the same continuum and are closely connected: The
	  former is all about business outcomes – intention and aspiration. The latter is all about details
	  of execution.
	  They are connected together by the release plan, which is the way the roadmap gets
	  expressed in the world. Note that the Roadmap does NOT have to reflect the release plan
	  exactly. In fact, in companies practicing really frequent or continuous delivery of small
	  iterations, it really doesn’t. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqs6png10pgz8603cnb2mmn))
	- Agile Teams Still Need a Roadmap! Your roadmap highlights your key focus areas. Is a
	  critical communication tool to enroll & align customers and other stakeholders. It’s an
	  invitation to discuss strategy - not the detailed plan. It also helps you communicates
	  uncertainty. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grqs6dzvwxzm67gc2dag0rn7))
	- uncertainty.

	- Here is the typical layout for a N/N/L roadmap. Remember these key points:
	  • It’s a high-level abstraction and invitation to a discussion. Notice the deliberate
	  abstraction of Near-Term Commitment, to Mid-Term Intention, to Long-Term
	  Aspiration.
	  • It should focus on User/Customer Value!
	  • It‘s NOT a detailed engineering plan– and doesn’t show ‘how long you’re working on any
	  item’
	  • It’s NOT a contract for Sales to commit you to. Don’t make promises you can’t keep!

	- Product Led Growth (PLG). In short: PLG refers to a model that uses your product and your users as the primary mechanism to drive growth, through acquiring new customers, and while retaining & monetizing your existing customers. While simple in concept, this is in stark contrast to the above, well-worn model of using Marketing & Sales programs for these efforts. And, here, ‘Service’ means most or all customer-facing transactions are handled inside the product: Implementation, Onboarding, Product Support, Upsell, Renewals… Once a customer has actually used your product, and is receiving value from it, they are much more likely to purchase or renew – we call these Product-Qualified Leads (PQL). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs71ex7kcjg2hypzqda0cwy9))

	- PQLs offer improved Lead Quality - you don’t need an army of salespeople pursuing lower-quality leads for smaller deals. Your leads are higher-quality since your customers are already using the product. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs71gsrbyfzgg09r9x4fexf7))

	- Product-led Growth: Five Rules
	  We have codified a simple set of rules you should follow to become Product-Led and reap its benefits:
	  1. Know thy user – PLG demands an unprecedented coupling between your users and your product
	  2. Give before you get – deliver value immediately, and definitely before you ask for payment
	  3. Obsess about Growth- drive monetization, retention & referral through every interaction your users have with your product
	  4. Make it Easy and Fun – assure simple, productive user Onboarding & Activation, gamify where you can
	  5. Organize around Product & User – Use PLG to inform how PM interacts with Marketing & Sales. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs71krddgsdnt8mdjqfx52ws))
	- Product-led Rule 1: Know Thy User As we’ve noted, knowing your User is essential to delighting them. Hiring a UX expert and practicing Design Thinking are good starts. Customer Journey Mapping is also a very powerful technique to better know your user. We’ve encountered four major types of journey maps. While they look similar on the surface, each has a different focus and business purpose: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs71myaa489z9cvsqhev3h1b))
	- Current state: The most common type of journey map, these maps illustrate what your customers do, think, and feel as they interact with your business today. Because these maps highlight existing pain points of your customers, they’re well suited for driving incremental improvements to your customer experience (CX) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs71n6rch9c9f9cghxz40516))
	- Day in the life: These journey maps also illustrate what people do, think, and feel today. But they take a wider view by examining everything that customers or prospects do (within a specific area of focus), whether that involves your company or not. Because these maps highlight existing pain points in peoples’ lives, they’re best suited for driving innovation through addressing unmet needs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs71nwphfqegmqw29b3sv8pf))
	- Future state: These journey maps illustrate what your customers will do, think, and feel as they interact with your business at some point in the future. They’re best suited for communicating your vision for how new products, services, and experiences will function ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs71ppt6n8ncjba9154n7vxj))

	- JTBD theory, says, simply, that: ‘Customers don't buy a product as much as they ‘hire it’ to do a Job that improves their lives in a particular way.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrz81derhbvb7y0nscjm95e))
	- ‘‘JTBD’ come in 3 primary varieties: • Functional - see above. And Watch the video by Clayton Christensen on the ‘Job of a McDonald’s Shake’
	  • Emotional - How do you feel before/ during/after performing a task? • Social - How do you want to be perceived by others? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrz8sb8e6eb8veqmsbd2pf1))
	- We think about the job from the customer’s perspective, not the company’s. For example, a company that supplies herbicides to farmers may conclude that growers (the job executors) are trying to “kill weeds”, while the growers might say the job-to-be-done is to “prevent weeds from impacting crop yields” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrz98tgqmnh5m152vxxdkaf))
	- When interviewing potential users/customers, these (above) are the key areas to probe for their JTBD. Ask open ended questions, like: ‘Tell me about what happens when you…’, and always ask: ‘why do want to do that, and how does that make you feel?’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsrza0d7nj12yb089cy4rdqa))

	  their Pain Points. Ask questions, like:
	  • What do you find too costly? (e.g. takes a lot of time, costs too much money, requires
	  substantial efforts, …)
	  • What makes you feel bad? (e.g. frustrations, annoyances, things that give them a
	  headache, …)
	  • How are current solutions underperforming for you? (e.g. lack of features, performance,

	  quality level, more of something, less of something, …)
	  • How do current solutions delight you? (e.g. specific features, performance, quality, …)
	  • What would make your job or life easier? (e.g. flatter learning curve, more services, lower
	  cost of ownership, …)
	  • What positive social consequences do you desire? (e.g. makes them look good, increase in
	  power, status, …)
	  • What are you looking for? (e.g. good design, guarantees, specific or more features, …) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtdm5v03y15z43p0szkt0cz6))
	- What do you dream about? (e.g. big achievements, big reliefs, …)

	- Module 8: Product-Led Growth ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbwpbkrc8ngcae684vfa7ja))
	- For decades,
	  companies have used the idea of the marketing & sales funnel. The funnel mirrors what we
	  call the buyer’s journey, or the way a prospective buyer of a product becomes aware of the
	  product and its utility, to their ultimate purchase of the product. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbwr19yyebdew4kmkefrn7z))
	- This funnel concept has most commonly been applied to B2B products, but it applies broadly
	  to any product in any type of market. Consumer buyers go through each of these stages, even
	  for minor purchases - though they may be so expedited that the consumer barely notices. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbwrhmnfdmwkyj4h4m79hyy))
	- The funnel concept has long been marketing and sales’ way of describing how they could take
	  the broad addressable market and work through these stages to turn a potential into a buyer.
	  The reason this is a “funnel” is because, for every given number of people in your addressable
	  market, only some percentage would be paying attention, and a smaller number still would
	  get seriously interested in your product. And so on. Your Marketing team works to get
	  attention at the ‘top of the funnel’ [or ‘ToFu’], and hands-off any leads to Sales that show
	  significant signs of interest in your product – for instance downloading a whitepaper or asking
	  for a demo. We call these Marketing-Qualified Leads (MQL). Sales then comes on the scene
	  to work with customers on budget and timeline, and to hopefully get them to purchase. Once
	  a prospect has been further developed by Sales, and more likely to close, it becomes
	  known as a Sales-Qualified Lead (SQL). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbx06hnf7vcrt1kevqadesx))
	-  With the exception of possible trials or Proof of Concept efforts, most users never
	  experienced the product at all, until it was purchased for them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbx0f2n3zdhw1thgnfxqn68))
	- Many companies still operate along these lines today, and these concepts are neither wrong
	  nor outmoded. But, they are just one of the ways to grow your business.
	  Today, many types of companies are discovering a new way to grow which is product-led, and
	  combining or even replacing their prior funnels with different tactics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbx0b9epne5vhrgn1yrk9yf))

	- PLG Rule 3: Obsess about growth – Intro to Pirate Metrics ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbx4kw5hgv9st6y4v88xn4e))
	- One of the most notable aspects of SaaS is its iterative business model. Think of this as a
	  flywheel that should keep running at the same rate, or speed up – never slow down. This
	  three-step process is how digital business economics works – particularly in SaaS businesses.
	  They earn revenue based on how well they do in each of these three areas. This doesn’t equate
	  directly to profit but is necessary for these businesses to succeed and grow. Many important
	  SaaS businesses succeeded by running this flywheel exceedingly well. Most SaaS metrics are
	  based on this model, so this is the foundation for how digital businesses define and track
	  success ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbx7nnnqt4ybk8aptt7y4gn))
	- This framework is all about growing your business – we can use it to measure a new product,
	  or any product that we want to grow. The tricky thing about Pirate Metrics – or really any
	  measurement – is that what you measure really needs to match your product and business
	  model. Let’s look at each of these in order: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbx95dwzwd0qs4nf0g7kjnc))
	- Acquisition - “Where Are Our Users / Customers Coming From?” Eg Website visit > email
	  signup > webinar participation > sales call > conversion to customer. Lots conversions need to
	  happen driven by marketing & sales ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbx97hgfyrc454zpj284vnh))

	  Implementation + Onboarding and initial task (Aha moment) success! More on onboarding
	  later ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbx9a2xjn9h4k2v0xxac6h6))
	- Retention - “How many of your customers are you retaining and why are you losing the
	  others?” Are they coming back after the initial login? How frequently? Why or why not?
	  Remember: If your Customer Acquisition Rate > Your Customer Churn Rate = Growth! And if
	  your Churn Rate > Acquisition Rate you will likely lose a lot of money ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbx9cjn4xxcqbkfg05vrj3m))
	- Revenue - “How can you increase revenue and further monetize the customers we have?”
	  Upgrades? Cross-Sell? Up-Sell Services? More later on this topic
	  Referral - “How can you turn your customers into your advocates?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbx9g6xxcf6nxrqy5pbt5g1))
	- For B2C Products: Activation usually occurs before purchase, and Self-service is the norm.
	  For B2B Products: Purchase or contract likely occurs before Activation. Activation is often
	  owned by your Implementation/Services team
	  Consider the signs of an Activated Facebook User - if a user adds at least 10 friends within the
	  first 7 days of signups, then that user is going to be more engaged and thus going to stick
	  with Facebook longer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvbxagg16v92r928605k5thp))

	- For accounting and payroll products, the No. 1 influencer for a buyer was the accountant ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvhmmj5qgp0r30ysdadjzadm))
	- Once you find the folks who are trusted advisers to your customers and prospects, you need to help them do four things. In order, they need to know, use, love and recommend your products or services.
	  Know: They can’t recommend your solution if they don’t know about it. Use: To build their confidence, they have to actually use and understand your product.
	  Love: Figuring out what matters most to those folks is crucial. Make sure that they’re experiencing real value and that they see the value your product will provide for others. This is also about giving them an experience that is emotionally engaging, wins their hearts (not just their minds) and gets them excited.
	  Recommend: Find ways to help influencers amplify this love. Make it easy and rewarding for them to recommend your product. You can use things like referral fees to align your business interests. At Intuit, we built capabilities into our products that made accountant’s lives easier when their clients used QuickBooks, so they were motivated to get more folks using our products. How can you motivate your influencers to get more folks using your product or service? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvhmn2nhkd8vn3mtpq0ykq90))
	- Module 9: Optimizing and Experimenting ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvhmtn5h4dgnejjfepaxgyb7))
	- Activation can happen before or after purchase. E.g., for B2B, purchase on contract generally comes before first use, and certainly before recurring use. In either case, there are lots of different opportunities to make it easy and fun for our users and customers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvhmvhh8spdds6wvv4b176n0))
	- Activation: Help users reach “aha” quickly with an Onboarding Checklist:
	  Our job is to remove friction during Onboarding, when user motivation is at a high. We should make a strong 1st impression for everything new. Don’t overwhelm your users at the start; reveal functionality gradually. Engage users in-app for Announcements, providing Help, and soliciting feedback. Finally - Make it fun! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvhmx08thy9387yhrb1n6m9y))
	- Here are some best practices, called out in The Elements of User Onboarding, by Samuel Hulick
	  1. Streamline the 1st-run workflow, deliver a relevant “quick win” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvhmx6pzn3kydk572ecrq84c))
	- 2. Preload content wherever possible – what things should you already know about your customer?
	  3. Explicitly call out key early-use activities via lists or completion meters 4. Celebrate completed tasks with a success state reminder
	  5. Incentivize users to become more accountable for ongoing use. We will cover Gamification next. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvhmxfky49vbwe7h1mm1hc6k))
	- Gamify to Drive Retention and Referral Gamification simply refers to the application of game principles & mechanics into a nongame experience. Effective gamification can result in these outcomes: 1.
	  Increased return visits/use
	  2. Build Confidence / Mastery 3. Encourages exploration of advanced features 4. Builds in switching-costs 5. Drives Retention + Referral ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvhn3aphf22hty2qd02vabz9))
	- There are two clear advantages to Gamification: • Provides users an engaging place to practice, and a safe place to fail • Builds friendly competition, engagement & motivation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvhn3ryyx19r29ny0zdbzh82))
	- There are two clear disadvantages to Gamification: • It’s easy to lose sight of business goals • If it has no relevance to the user’s job, you won't change behavior User response varies substantially so apply gamification thoughtfully, sparingly, and avoid gimmicks – a little goes a long way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvhn8jp24gpb3xextrwqqw8m))
	- A/B Testing and a Bit of Statistics
	  A/B Testing is defined simply as a randomized experiment with two variants. It has been used for many years in digital marketing / web design and is routinely used by major SaaS providers to test product changes. The two key things you want to ensure are: 1. Statistical significance: This means the likelihood that the variation you see in your test is NOT due to random chance. Aim for >95% significance. A difference between variants is statistically significant when the chance of at least that big a difference showing up randomly is less than 5% [1]. If our test is changing the color of the “Buy” button, our baseline might be a blue button (A), and our variant a green button (B), The metric we’re tracking is what fraction of users click the button (the conversion rate). If B is significantly better than A at achieving clicks, it means that we can say with 95% certainty that B’s conversion rate for ALL users is higher, no matter the sample size. The larger the difference between variants, the more confident you can be that the results are statistically significant, with fewer samples.
	  2. Random sample: This means there should be no meaningful difference between the groups tested – a lack of bias between groups. Tools and your data team can help here. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvhna6dyvcgrbwyvqnp1kcc2))
	- Ideas about what would add value, and what you should build, are just hypotheses that you will need to test and validate – or disprove. Digital product managers are like product scientists in that we collect qualitative and quantitative data about our assumptions. Historically, this wasn’t really done, or if it was, it was likened to an art.
	  Today – we have a great combination of ways to make this work:
	  An ability to collect data - We’ve always had qualitative data, but now we also have the ability to more closely observe users and collect much more detailed data Ability to run experiments - We can test hypotheses with real users by updating our products quickly and iteratively, do trial runs and A/B testing.
