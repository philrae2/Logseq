	- 1. Tasks that you are driven toward by Gain produce more significant positive results in your life and your business than tasks that you are driven toward by Prevent Pain.

		- Your Highlight on page 17 | Location 247-248
	- You might immediately wonder why. When you are thinking about Gain and you are being motivated by Gain, you are focusing on something you want. You are figuring out how to produce a result that you desire in your life.

		- Your Highlight on page 18 | Location 271-273
	- You are not thinking about losing something or maintaining the status quo. You are working to move your life forward from where it is now, making it better than what it is today, considering how you desire your life to be‚Äîand that's exciting!

		- Your Highlight on page 18 | Location 273-275
	- Tasks such as putting gas in your car, doing laundry, and going grocery shopping all have to be done over and over again because the things necessary to maintain your life are never finished. By always focusing on getting them done and preventing pain, you don't end up with Gain; you end up with no pain and unfortunately no progress.

	- 8. There is no ‚Äúhave to‚Äù with a Gain task, because there are no consequences if you choose not to pursue Gain in your life.
		- Your Highlight on page 22 | Location 332-333
	- To move your life or your business forward from where it is today and to see an improvement, you must do something extraordinary‚Äîsomething that you didn't have to do at all. You must pursue Gain.

	- A Gain Task is Never Urgent Urgency is a great human motivator.
		- Your Highlight on page 24 | Location 363-364
	- But when it comes to results, urgency alone can't deliver. It is not a great criterion for deciding what is most important or what will produce the most significant results in your life.

	- 12. The second attribute for a Gain task is you don't have to do it.
		- Your Highlight on page 25 | Location 378-379
	- Completing a Gain task should produce significant results; otherwise, you wouldn't do it
	  id:: e0897474-0d25-42cf-b9e2-f8cdcfc65bdb
		- Your Highlight on page 26 | Location 394-395
	- The nature of a Gain goal or accomplishment means that only you can achieve the results you seek. And only you can experience the satisfaction and improvement that comes from them. You can't delegate your goals and dreams to another person.

		- Your Highlight on page 27 | Location 400-402
	- 16. The question is, are you delegating enough? If you're spending time completing Prevent Pain tasks that someone else could complete, you're missing out on chances to advance your business, relationships, or life. You are giving up the opportunity to pursue Gain when you don't delegate effectively.
		- Your Highlight on page 27 | Location 408-410
	- 17. But the number one question to consider is, What else could you be doing with your time if you weren't doing that task? Most likely the answer would have something to do with pursuing Gain in some area of your life.
		- Your Highlight on page 28 | Location 415-417
	- 19. Delegation is a necessary tool because limited time is the number one obstacle to learning, growing, and pursuing goals. It is the key strategic skill that enables you to spend time moving your life forward versus staying where you are.

		- Your Highlight on page 30 | Location 460-461
	- 21. leadership is improvement ‚Äîmoving things forward from where they are today and making them better.
		- Your Highlight on page 31 | Location 465-466
	- 22. True leadership does not depend on a title or a position. Having a position of authority in a group gives you the opportunity to make decisions that improve or change things. But if things don't get better as a result, then you are not a leader. This turns leadership from a somewhat fuzzy concept into a result that you must produce.
		- Your Highlight on page 31 | Location 476-479
	- 23. Doing what we have to do each day to maintain our lives is management. This is not what defines us as individuals; rather, it is what makes us the same as everyone else. Personal leadership is doing what we don't have to do to lead ourselves forward and grow each day. This is where we get our self-identity, and what differentiates us from others.
		- Your Highlight on page 32 | Location 488-492
	- 24. We must continuously adapt, grow, and improve to lead ourselves forward as things around us change‚Äîand to avoid getting stuck in a rut. The way to do that is through personal leadership, or Gain,
		- Your Highlight on page 33 | Location 493-495
	- 25. So how do you avoid burnout with everything you have to do, manage, and maintain? How do you find balance? The answer is to insert Gain into your life. Pursuing Gain tasks and obtaining the results they produce are what keep you from feeling like you are spinning your wheels and not pleasing anyone (including yourself). It prevents you from working hard but failing to create anything of significance.
		- Your Highlight on page 36 | Location 538-541
	- 26. Identifying a Gain task that would produce significant results toward the life you want or progress toward a goal you have makes all your work worth the effort.
		- Your Highlight on page 36 | Location 541-542
	- 27. Gain tasks help you feel balanced because of the positive results they produce in your life‚Äîresults that you identified as something you want. When you are achieving something you want, you feel balanced.

	- 28. Although many companies do their best by offering perks such as a flexible work schedule, child care, or financial services, these things can only help you manage life more efficiently. They can't give your life direction, momentum, or balance.
		- Your Highlight on page 37 | Location 562-564
	- 29. It sounds like people believe there is an inherent conflict between work and life! This is an unfortunate perspective, because you don't have a separate professional life and personal life; you have only a life. This dichotomy leads people to say things like they want to work really hard and retire at 50 and have the ‚Äúrest of their lives to do what they want.‚Äù But does that produce balance? Would it be wise to wait until your life is half over before you start living it?
		- Your Highlight on page 38 | Location 575-578
	- 30. Gain Is the Answer to the Balance Crisis The only one who can create balance in your life is you. And the only way to create it is to seek to make your life better today than it was yesterday. You do that by pursuing Gain.
		- Your Highlight on page 39 | Location 597-600
	- 31. You worked toward a goal, and your hard work produced real results and made an improvement in your (and probably, someone else's) life. That's what goals do for us. They make our lives better today than they were yesterday. Moving toward our goals creates balance and the excitement that we need to keep going.

		- Your Highlight on page 40 | Location 612-613
	- 33. The best way to combat burnout and stress‚Äîand achieve a feeling that your life is balanced between what you have to do and what makes you feel alive‚Äîis to continuously seek improvement in some area of your life.
		- Your Highlight on page 41 | Location 621-622
	- Unless we are constantly working toward improving some area of life, we will be focused on the parts of life that naturally get worse over time. This can cause stress, burnout, resentment, regret, and depression‚Äînot clinical depression but the despairing feeling that yesterday was better than today.

	- 35. It comes from feeling that our efforts are outweighing our rewards.
		- Your Highlight on page 43 | Location 650-651
	- Goals are the ticket out of any sense of depression. They improve and offset the losses or decay in our lives so we don't end up in a rut. They alleviate that feeling that you have worked hard and accomplished nothing. When you are working toward Gain, you end the day feeling like you have made progress and are moving forward.

		- Your Highlight on page 44 | Location 662-664
	- Gain and Prevent Pain Must Work Together The feeling of balance comes when you have done what you had to do to maintain life and Prevent Pain plus you have done something you didn't have to do to move life forward a little today.
	  id:: 846c5437-a3e7-499b-ae71-1597a586e25a
		- Your Highlight on page 44 | Location 668-670
	- So many people are in search of balance, but you can't just find balance; you have to create it by ensuring that you are seeking results that will justify your efforts.

		- Your Highlight on page 44 | Location 670-671
	- In fact, studies have reported that the most important motivator that employees felt was not the promise of raises and promotions, but rather the feeling of making progress toward a meaningful goal every day.

		- Your Highlight on page 45 | Location 684-685
	- 40. This feeling correlated to more creativity and better-quality work. Without this feeling of progress and accomplishment, people lose the motivation to continue doing constructive work and burnout begins to set in.
		- Your Highlight on page 45 | Location 685-687
	- 41. The key to getting started on this journey of improvement and achieving balance in your life is to identify the opportunities for Gain in your life, then prioritize and plan.
		- Your Highlight on page 45 | Location 690-691
	- Drama occurs when you give something more time and attention than it deserves based on the results that it produces. Drama is misprioritizing.

		- Your Highlight on page 48 | Location 731-733
	- 43. Remember the first attribute of a Gain task: they are never urgent! The things that will bring you the greatest results in your life don't have a deadline.
		- Your Highlight on page 48 | Location 733-734
	- Effective prioritizing is not based on deadlines or urgency. It is based on results. Effective prioritizing assigns value and order to events in advance of their occurrence and requires that you ask some new questions: What results does this task produce in your life? Which activities in your life produce the greatest results?

		- Your Highlight on page 48 | Location 735-738
	- 45. So here is a new way to prioritize. A, B, and C should represent the results that a task produces for you personally after you've completed it.
		- Your Highlight on page 49 | Location 738-739
	- 48. The old maxim that ‚Äúwhatever gets measured, gets done‚Äù has been attributed to many different authors and thinkers over the years. It essentially means that if you are in a management position and you want your employees to complete something, then you need to measure it, track it, require that it be done by a certain time, and then record performance surrounding it. In other words, if you communicate standards clearly, then they will be reached.

	- If you try to finish all of your Prevent Pain tasks before you pursue Gain, then Gain will never happen, because Prevent Pain is never finished. You have to do both in conjunction with each other.

		- Your Highlight on page 59 | Location 901-901
	- 52. With each hour of ‚Äúhave to‚Äù that goes by, you feel more drained and move more slowly. However, inserting a Gain task in the middle of a Prevent Pain day can give you the energy you need to move forward and make the Prevent Pain tasks take less time through motivation.
		- Your Highlight on page 59 | Location 903-905
	- 53. Think of consumption goals as a short-term reward for the hard work you have done. You can use them as a source of energy and an incentive to get through the day, week, or month. But you need to balance them with creation goals, objectives that are more meaningful and that will enhance your life in the longer term. We need both consumption

		- Your Highlight on page 63 | Location 966-967
	- 58. The two categories of motivation are fear and desire. We fear the pain of consequences of not doing something we ‚Äúhave to‚Äù do. We desire the results brought on by Gain and movement in our lives.
		- Your Highlight on page 69 | Location 1046-1048
	- When we pursue a creation goal, that type of Gain that moves us forward on the results continuum, we start to see results, and it inspires us. The difference between this and a consumption goal is that a creation goal's reward comes after we've done the work.

		- Your Highlight on page 69 | Location 1058-1059
	- When you have a long-term goal, it's crucial to celebrate and reward yourself along the way. If you try to wait until the whole thing is over to feel rewarded, you run the risk of being exhausted and giving up before you get there.

	- 63. The delayed rewards of creation goals may test your resolve and challenge your perseverance, regardless of whether or not you love the work involved in reaching it. But that's the nature of these tasks; if they didn't challenge you, you would have accomplished them long ago.
		- Your Highlight on page 73 | Location 1116-1118
	- 64. Procrastination is the decision you make when you opt to draw energy from the fear of consequences instead of the accomplishment of Gain tasks.
		- Your Highlight on page 74 | Location 1131-1132
	- 65. You wait until you get so close to the deadline for something that you scare yourself into thinking you might not get it done on time, and then you'll have to face the consequences. This fear gives you the burst of energy you need to do the task.
		- Your Highlight on page 74 | Location 1132-1133
	- 66. Now, you probably ask yourself every time you procrastinate, ‚ÄúWhy do I do this to myself?‚Äù The answer is now clear: to get the energy to do the things we don't want to do. Your energy level heightens, you focus and are able to better block out distractions. Your speed is faster; you pick up your pace to ensure it gets done on time. And it takes less effort; it's easier! These are the benefits to procrastination.

		- Your Highlight on page 80 | Location 1225-1225
	- 68. procrastination doesn't work when something will be recorded‚Äîor memorable. You will wind up regretting that you waited that long and had to put your name on something that isn't up to your standards. You can't use fear as your motivator when quality matters.
	- When quality matters, you need to derive the energy you need to get the work done from something other than fear, a more sustainable energy source, specifically, the Gain in your life. Gain continues to motivate and inspire always.

	- 70. Nothing about our Prevent Pain tasks sets us apart from anyone else. The results you get every day are not determined by the ‚Äúhave to‚Äù tasks.
		- Your Highlight on page 86 | Location 1311-1312
	- 71. It's rare that we consciously make a decision regarding our highest priority in life right at that minute. The best we can usually do is to take a few minutes to plan out the day and, if it's a great day, keep the plan in mind as the day moves along.
		- Your Highlight on page 87 | Location 1322-1325
	- 72. Goes To start making better decisions about our time, we need to understand what comprises our time in the first place. And we can classify pretty much everything we do every day into three categories: habits, to-do items, and calendar events.
		- Your Highlight on page 89 | Location 1358-1360
	- Habits are things we spend time on that we don't have to write down or think about, because we don't normally forget to do them. They include our daily routines: sleeping, brushing our teeth, eating a meal, commuting to work, reading before bed, catching up on the news headlines on the way into work, turning on the TV when we get home.

To-do lists are for things that make you busy, that is, the mundane Prevent Pain stuff that you need to check off regardless of whether or not it has a deadline.

		- Your Highlight on page 94 | Location 1429-1430
	- We know by now that if you put a Gain task on a to-do list right next to a Prevent Pain item, the Prevent Pain will always win, because your life is being run by habits and maintenance items.

	- If you are working on a detailed, tedious, or complex part of a project, then you can help yourself recover more efficiently by recording where you are on your plan when you get interrupted. You should also note what your next action should be when you return to working on it, because you usually can't depend on your brain to remember a relevant thought you just had.

I cannot count on this person to be reliable.

	- 99. your decisions move things forward and improve the situations around you, then you are a leader. If your decisions lack the courage, ingenuity, vision, or effort to make any sort of improvements, then perhaps you have been a good manager; that is, you have been adept at keeping things the way they are and maintaining the status quo but not necessarily at enhancing anything. If you've made your decisions based on ego or emotions such as resentment, envy, or selfishness, then perhaps you have mismanaged your responsibilities and left things worse off than they were before. Business leadership is about forging new paths and moving an organization forward from where it is today, rather than keeping things the way they are.

	- 100. You are building your identity when you are working toward Gain. Your identity comes from knowing who you are, what you have accomplished, and where you are going. So how will you get your identity if you don't have any movement in your life? How will you differentiate yourself? Too many people try to garner this sense of self from the outside world, namely, by competing with and sizing up against others. This is the approach people take when their egos are threatened or unsatisfied because it's your ego's job to protect and validate you. Without the strong sense of self-identity that comes from pursuing Gain, your ego will try to compensate by competing with and comparing you to people around you.

	- 102. If, on the other hand, you're constantly trying to win, you're likely to obsess over how others perceive you. You'll become overly concerned about what your status is in regard to material possessions, such as cars and houses, or titles and positions in business or society. Your relationships will deteriorate in either case, because trying to beat everyone at something is exhausting, not to mention damaging. It erodes the trust that two people need to have to be in a successful relationship, whether that connection is professional, a friendship, with family, with neighbors, with team members, or with someone else.

	- 104. Working toward Gain builds identity and self-esteem, because your creation goals in particular define you and build your legacy as a leader. You can't build an identity by only pursuing consumption goals; these are an escape from life and responsibilities.
