- If we rely solely on our depth of knowledge without considering other perspectives and information outside our scope of vision, we may be at risk of making uninformed decisions.
- On the other hand, if we lack depth and only breadth, we may not have the details needed to make a good decision either.
- We have to ensure we get different perspectives, feedback, and criticism that can cover the gaps of breadth and depth in our knowledge.
