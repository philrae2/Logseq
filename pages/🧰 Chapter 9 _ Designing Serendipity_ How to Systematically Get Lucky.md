title: ðŸ§° Chapter 9 | Designing Serendipity: How to Systematically Get Lucky
---

- > Systematically getting lucky is important in personal projects. You do it by:
- Planting the seeds of serendipity
- Noticing and nurturing the sprouting of serendipity
- Harvesting the fruits of serendipity
#.chapterdistillation

- When I left corporate tech and started my journey of entrepreneurship, I continued to use the project management tools I learned. They helped me build and run my business.
	 - I also realized that something was missing. Maximizing good fortune is extremely important in personal projects, like building your own business. Yet this was missing in my project management toolbox.
		 - This blindness is probably necessary in large corporations[*](((37f00362-76e1-4817-bf39-19526ccd3d4e))) but is a critical weakness in personal projects. Big company project managers tend to neglect these two truths:
			 - > There are much more good things impossible plan for than good things you can plan for.
id:: 94993fa1-d9ac-44eb-a186-39b456044022
				 - {{mermaid}}
					 - pie title Good things that could happen to you
						 - "things you can plan for": 1

						 - "things impossible to plan for": 100

			 - > Your future selves are generally wiser than your present and past selves.
id:: 20a50cbf-6498-4212-9d1e-95d87a39edaa

- What would our playbook look like if we took these truths seriously? I have been collecting tools and frameworks in the past years to build this playbook. I call it "Designing Serendipity," and it has three parts:
	 - Planting the seeds of serendipity
id:: d97eb4aa-30fb-4837-9ab2-75604626b5a5

	 - Noticing and nurturing the sprouting of serendipity
id:: 2d769f5a-2e5e-4174-83f9-5e2458b8f1ab

	 - Harvesting the fruits of serendipity
id:: 6b4fd85a-e72e-46d9-8c0f-9b101f16ae8c

- In the context of project management, this means allowing your future selves to change the scope of the projectâ€”or even drop the project!â€”if good fortune opens new opportunities.

- ((d97eb4aa-30fb-4837-9ab2-75604626b5a5))
	 - Increase your luck surface area
		 - A key concept in planting seeds of serendipity is the [[luck surface area]]:
			 - > ((8211aed3-effe-4d17-946f-2dd1645770cf))

		 - To increase your luck surface are, you:
			 - **do** more of the things you're passionate about

			 - **tell** more people about what you're doing

		 - This practice has other names:
			 - [[working with the garage door open]]

			 - [[building in public]]

		 - In [[Project Accessible Genomics]], I planted seeds both through content and through outreach.
			 - ((388bd5ee-13d8-40c8-9415-d3d2d099d62c))
				 - ((bdca3c24-69d8-463a-a1ed-387b49b3134a))
					 - Note the invisible numbers game here. It follows the Pareto principle (80/20):
						 - 80% of your good fortune will come from 20% of the things you are passionate about
id:: 446dc93e-7a06-4c4d-b82c-8a2f58dd1437

						 - 80% of serendipities will come from 20% of those you reach out to[*](((45638a3e-2077-43d1-9ac1-c7547fefb77c)))

		 - The biggest barrier I notice for doing and telling is the fear of embarrassment. In most cases, the inevitable failures and mistakes in public have no consequences outside of emotional discomfort.
			 - Rationalizing fear through practices like [Fear-Setting](https://tim.blog/2017/05/15/fear-setting/) will probably help. In my experience, what killed this fear is experiencing failure again and again, and eventually realizingâ€”not just with reason, but with my entire beingâ€”that there is nothing to fear.
				 - When I started my business, I needed to sell. I had to cold-call, visit offices and get through all sorts of gate-keepers. Most outcomes were rejections. At some point, I think that part of my mind just died.

		 - [[Maximize your learning]]
			 - In which communities might you have the best chance of creating some serendipity?
id:: a40e4d1d-9712-4b4e-aaf3-41fc866fc4cc
				 - 

			 - What can you change in your routine to allow you to share more of what you are doing to these communities?**
				 - 

			 - If fear is a barrier for you:
				 - Do [Tim Ferriss' Fear-Setting exercise](https://tim.blog/2017/05/15/fear-setting) for [[working with the garage door open]].

				 - What are small daily practices you could do to inoculate yourself against the fear of embarrassment?
					 - 

	 - Increase three of the four types of luck
		 - There are [[four types of luck]]. We can increase three of them.
			 - Blind luck
				 - Blind luck is good fortune that we have no influence over. We can, however, notice it better. We'll explore how to do this [in the next section](((f9d7f391-1413-4b16-b256-2ab5f6159471))).

			 - Luck from action
				 - Luck from action is good fortune that comes from just doing a lot of things.
					 - A salesperson's luck of closing deals is proportional to the number of leads pursued. The number of scientists who joined [[Project Accessible Genomics]] is probably proportional to the total number of scientists I pitched the idea to.
id:: 45638a3e-2077-43d1-9ac1-c7547fefb77c

			 - Luck from expertise
				 - Luck from expertise is good fortune that only you could see, because of your depth of knowledge, or because of your unique mix of interests.
					 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamfu%2Fyeoucddndx.png?alt=media&token=fc91d400-d61b-4098-8104-111cf76058d9)

					 - Let's recall that fateful day when the idea of [[Project Accessible Genomics]] presented itself. ((1e2b88a7-6690-43a6-ae83-84d32bca1235))
						 - **I saw this problem** early in the pandemic: developing countries will have to sequence SARS-CoV-2 to identify its variants. Yet, these countries have few sequencers and they tend to be concentrated in their major cities. **I also saw the solution**: recent innovations have produced low-cost and portable genetic sequencers. I can build a global volunteer team, raise funding, and lead a project to bring SARS-CoV-2 sequencing to the developing world.
							 - I saw a problem because I dove deep into the world of [nanopore sequencing](((cfb49f5f-54c1-4f40-8360-676cf80011a4))) prior to the pandemic and because I live in the developing world. I saw the solution because of my experience in entrepreneurship and leading global cross-cultural project teams.

				 - If ((446dc93e-7a06-4c4d-b82c-8a2f58dd1437)), then you can increase your luck by going **deeper** into **more** passions.

			 - Luck from reputation
id:: feabc7a7-9125-44df-9672-0fd5615687c1
				 - Luck from reputation is good fortune that comes to you because of other people's knowledge of your skills and interest.
					 - There are three things you'd want to influence:
						 - **Audience**: the individuals and communities that are most likely to confer luck on you

						 - **Reach**: the number of those individuals who champion you

						 - **Message**: their knowledge of your interests and trustworthiness (ability, integrity)

					 - __It is the beginning of a heist movie, in that scene where they are planning that one last big job. The team goes through the plan and realizes that they need a special kind of skill. One teammate smiles and says, "I know someone."__
id:: 469fc078-5452-414f-8a6a-0a1ec669ae90
						 - You'd want to be that someone if that special skill is at the intersection of your interests.
							 - This is another reason for [[working with the garage door open]].
								 - Since I built [[Project Accessible Genomics]] in public,[*](((388bd5ee-13d8-40c8-9415-d3d2d099d62c))) my brand in a few people's minds was probably "that guy who is working to bring genomics to the developing world."
									 - I remember my past self discovering [iGEM](https://igem.org/), an international genetic engineering student competition, and regretting that I may be too old for it and that I don't have the technical chops to build my own team.
										 - On [[June 15th, 2021]], I was invited to be part of an iGEM team by one of the scientists in Project Accessible Genomics! [The goal of this iGEM team is to "democratize the means of biotechnological production."](https://twitter.com/Friendzymes/status/1418608548938883081)

							 - You can also [make use of Stakeholder Analysis and create a Communications Plan]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 7 | Get Support, Get Work Done and Get Lucky: Stakeholder Communications]]) to deliberately brand yourself as that someone.
								 - Using publicity through the press is part of our communications plan in [[Project Accessible Genomics]] to gain donations. We created a press release and sent messages to our supporters. Most went nowhere. But we got connected to a CNN reporter who covers SARS-CoV-2 variant tracking. We got interviewed for a news segment last [[June 30th, 2021]].
									 - This publicity will probably increase the [[luck surface area]] of the project, and perhaps open new serendipities for me. At the very least, it will make my mother proud.

	 - Noticing serendipity
id:: f9d7f391-1413-4b16-b256-2ab5f6159471
		 - The work of project management is the work of focusing your team's work, time and attention to bring an idea to reality. To notice luck, we need to occasionally disengage and look far and wide around the terrain. Here are two practices to help you notice the sprouting of serendipity:
			 - Daily gratitude list
id:: 46773dfb-bb3e-4c70-9056-e2c9d5551ad6

			 - Treating ideas as persons
id:: 8a749151-9dc9-4b0e-a183-82331794bdf0

		 - ((46773dfb-bb3e-4c70-9056-e2c9d5551ad6))
			 - A daily gratitude list is a common practice among Roam users. This practice improves mood (it is hard to be grateful and be grumpy at the same time). The practice also helps us notice good fortune.

		 - ((8a749151-9dc9-4b0e-a183-82331794bdf0))
id:: 8500f260-ad63-4b26-bb57-cf27761b16b8
			 - ((aa875375-97ab-4c00-bdb5-3af09567ac1f))
				 - Liz Gilbert uses the language of myth to present what ideas are and how we should work with them.
					 - Ideas are beings from another realm whose life's mission is to become manifested in this world. To do so, they must partner with a human. When they find the right one, they present themselves and propose a partnership. The ancients call this a visitation from a muse.
						 - In practical terms, this means treating ideas persons. Liz Gilbert waits for ideas, ready to serve them, like an English butler waiting at the foyer for his master (she says she dresses up for this). She feels honored when she is selected to be the idea's partner. If she says Yes, she commits to that partnership.

			 - There is a part of me which finds this absurd. However, I have tested this and it seems to work. Perhaps treating ideas as persons is a mental hack to make us more mindful of them, as we are wired to pay attention to people.
				 - I prefer to act as an equal to the muses rather than their servant. I tell them, "I have five pomodoros this morning. Who wants to be made manifest today?" I hope this attitude does not discourage them from visiting me. 

	 - Nurturing serendipity
		 - > People confer luck on you.
id:: 370f9868-3bd4-4a4a-a28f-25d7e781c6a4
			 - I found this statement hard to believe at first, and even a bit offensive, because being the master of my fate[*](((b29214df-b94b-41cc-aca3-51d1e7baef74))) is central to my values. In some domains, however, this seems undeniable. For instance, in Hip-hop, it appears that budding artists need the anointing of an established artist to break into the business.[*](https://bonuscut.com/2014/02/26/the-power-of-a-co-sign-how-far-it-can-take-a-hip-hop-artist)
id:: c606bbd1-12db-4f6e-8c7e-e81181cccac6
				 - My bias may also be due to the kind of game I'm playing. I had to build my brand[*](((feabc7a7-9125-44df-9672-0fd5615687c1))) for the people around me to champion my projects and to open serendipities for me. In my case, that power to confer luck is not concentrated among a few individuals.
					 - We can generalize this principle to apply to both kinds of games:
						 - > In games where the power to confer luck is concentrated, focus on nurturing key relationships. In games where the power to confer luck is distributed, focus on building a reputation.
							 - This looks analogous to the difference in customer acquisition strategies of companies that serve larger enterprises and those that sell fast-moving consumer goods. The former is sales-driven and the latter is marketing-driven.
								 - We already borrowed the marketing approach in the section on ((feabc7a7-9125-44df-9672-0fd5615687c1)). We can borrow the process of sales for getting lucky in domains where luck is conferred by a few:
									 - Build a consistent source of prospects to add to your pipeline

									 - Have a way of qualifying the people you add to your pipeline

									 - Operate a system that allows you to take notes on relationship history and to schedule next steps

			 - How can you start a one-on-one relationship with key individuals in your communities?
				 - 

		 - How would you do this in Roam? ((844ea9ba-a8d9-49c0-b5ab-a6afcbd13495))
			 - 

			 - If you do a web search for "CRM RoamResearch," you will find articles and videos on this. They cover the relationship note-taking part but none of the ones I've seen talk about **always having an open task for each prospect**, which is a sales [[pro tip]].
				 - Here's how I do this in Roam. I create a block that connects three linked references: a TODO, a DATE, and a person's name. When you reach that day you linked, you will see the TODO under the linked references of the day's daily notes page. For example:
					 - TODO Tell [[Kahlil Corazo]] https://twitter.com/Roamfu how Professional Project Management with Roam improved your life [[January 22nd, 2022]] 

				 - Another [[pro tip]] from sales: always share something that creates value and avoid sounding like a spammer.

	 - The Slack Inventory
		 - You can get lucky only if you have slack. You can harvest the fruits of serendipity only if you have time to explore, a bit of money you can lose, and emotional reserves to take on risks. I learned about the slack inventory from the Goal Crafting Intensive workshop run by [Complice](https://complice.co/). I made it a table and added columns to make it actionable.

		 - [[Maximize your learning]]
			 - Fill out this slack inventory table
				 - [[slack inventory]]
					 - {{[[table]]}}
						 - **Category**
							 - **Source of slack**
								 - **Source of tightness**
									 - **How to increase slack or reduce tightness**

						 - **Time**

						 - **Financial resources**

						 - **Shelter, living situation**

						 - **Food, water, utilities**

						 - **Transportation**

						 - **Physical wellbeing**

						 - **Emotional energy and resilience**

						 - **Attention / cognitive capacity / executive function**

						 - **Interpersonal trust and regard**

						 - **Social connections and community support**

			 - List down TODOs or charter projects to increase slack and reduce tightness.
				 - 

	 - Project Management
		 - Learning project management makes you luckier. When serendipity is ready for harvest, you'll have the tools and the skills to make it happen!

- [[Next chapter]]
	 - Project managers are focus managers. They help the project team (including themselves) to blur out all tasks except the one intended for the week or for the day. We will learn project schedule and focus management in the next chapter: [[ðŸ§° Chapter 10 | Schedule Management = Focus Management]]
