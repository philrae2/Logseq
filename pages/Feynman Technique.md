- The Steps
	 - Pretend to teach a concept you want to learn about to a student in the sixth grade. #blck:yellow
		 - We mask our lack of understanding by using complicated vocabulary and jargon. 
			 - If you can't define the words and terms you are using, you don't really know what you're talking about.

		 - You need  to make sure your explanation isn't above , say, a sixth-grade reading level by using easily accessible words and phrases.

	 - Identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to better understand it. #blck:yellow
		 - Identifying gaps in our knowledge, where we forget or can't simply explain it is critical for our learning to stick

		 - When we identify and acknowledge gaps and are honest of our circle of competence we are less likely to commit mistakes. 

	 - Organize and simplify. #blck:yellow

	 - Transmit (optional).#blck:yellow
