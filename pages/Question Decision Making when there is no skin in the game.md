- **Note:**
	 - Watch out for environments where decision makers are far removed from the consequences of their decision making. Good decision making relies on all parties knowledgeable of the situation. If one party is not transparent on the underlying principles of the processes, then subpar decisions are going to be made.

	 - Make sure to uncover and peel the underlying principles of the conversation and the topic of conversation. If decisions are being made ask what frameworks and analysis are employed to make them.

	 - [[Be careful from taking advice from people who are better at explaining than actually doing the process.]]
