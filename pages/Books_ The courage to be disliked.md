- Fleeting Notes:
	- The world is complicated because subjectively we interpret it as complicated. The world is subjective and we provide the meaning to it. We can only share the same world if we adopt the same meaning to it. 
	  id:: e94e293a-0b69-4086-bfc8-bfaa4a8b4dd4
		- Our interpretation of the world isn't about the world but about us. The world can change through changing ourselves and our interpretations of it. 
		  id:: 714f6995-9fea-4c75-b23a-0c18635d36f0
	- In [[Adlerian psychology]] the past doesn't matter. It is counter to [[determinism]]
		- Determinism is the philosophical view that all events are determined completely by previously existing causes.
		- [[Adlerian psychology]] is concerned with the present and relies on [[teleology]] - the study of the purpose of a given phenomenon, rather than its cause- instead of [[etiology]] (the study of the causation)
			- Freud psychology is [etiological]([[etiology]]), explaining who are through the affect of our past experiences.
				- [[Freudian Psychology]] is typified by the trauma argument and resembles determinism in a different form—it leads to [[nihilism]]
				  id:: 84da9135-43a6-4a78-a0f5-8d1df9ed47f8
				- [[Freudian Psychology]] takes away our freedom of choice and treats humans like machines
				  id:: f5057394-972e-4377-b279-adc14c656978
		- [[Adlerian psychology]] also denies [[trauma]]
			- > No experience is itself a cause of our success or failure. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences—the so-called trauma—but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes. We are not determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining.
			- > No matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how you live from now on.
				- We determine our own lives according to the meaning we give to our past experiences. Our lives are not determined by past events themselves but to the meaning we ascribe to them.  
				  id:: e3b942e2-ff83-48a8-963f-f6b4bb31bdcf
		- [[Adlerian psychology]] states that the world is simple and it only seems complicated because we interpret as such through our subjective view. Life is simple but we make it complicated. People act to achieve goals and we are not drive by causes of our past. People can change and we choose the lifestyle that we live. 
		  id:: f4ed9e5b-ccc0-4987-8228-b86ad5c7cbda
	- People fabricate anger
		- Our anger is created so we can shout or express other typical actions that express anger. We can instead choose not to be angry or express anger in atypical ways. 
		  id:: 759bc8d2-53ec-4c85-ab94-b2df5af9b4ad
	- How to live without being controlled by the past
		- We are not controlled by emotions and therefore not controlled by the past
		  id:: 6edb56e2-eb14-4c64-9877-c0c094bba497
		- If we live life through an [etiological]([[etiology]]) sense then we will be bound by the past and never be able to find [[happiness]]
		  id:: bd26e276-8be6-4ee0-8123-0c30fdbfe34a
	- All problems are interpersonal relationship problems
		- It's impossible to not get hurt when we enter into relationships with people (work, personal relationship) and we will end up hurting someone too. "To get rid of one's problems, all one can do is live in the universe all alone."
		  id:: cb7cb755-6bea-44f2-9aea-466d7a2dbbd4
		- Feelings of Inferiority Are Subjective Assumptions
			- Our feelings of inferiority stem from our interpersonal relationships because we compare ourselves to others around us. We give subjective value judgments on different things and give them subjective values like our height, beauty, or wealth.
			- [[subjectivity]] allows us to make a choices on our interpretations of comparisons. We can interpret our characteristics as either positive or negative.
				- We can't alter objective facts, but we can alter subjective interpretations any we want.
		- An Inferiority Complex is an excuse
			- A complex refers to an abnormal mental state made up of a complicated group of emotions and ideas, and has nothing to do with the feelings of inferiority.
			- Our inferiority complex is the counterpart to our pursuit of superiority. Inferiority complex comes about when we feel we are not achieving our goals. Our feelings for inferiority and pursuit of superiority are a normal part of our lives and when used in a healthy manner are motivators for growth.
			  id:: dd23c2d7-2cc3-4b2b-a6ff-6a6b113942d1
		- Braggarts Have Feelings of Inferiority
			- We can't sustain feelings of inferiority for very long and can therefore switch over to a superiority complex. Usually, this can be expressed through making a show of being on good terms with a powerful person, misrepresenting one's work, or excessive allegiance to particular brands of clothing. These are usual forms of "giving authority", we are gaining a sense of superiority through linking ourselves to authority.  It's a fabricated feeling of superiority. 
			  id:: 855a46dd-8de9-4859-a8d1-72666ea9532d
			- [[Boast]]ing is an inverted feeling of superiority. If one really has confidence in oneself, one doesn't really feel the need to boast. It's because of our strong feelings of inferiority that can cause to boast. 
			  id:: f64fd4ba-eada-4d3a-8aa9-ae715c4a57a5
			- Some people try to make themselves special through boasting about their misfortune, and that their misfortune place them above others. People like this, reveal their misfortune and try to control other people with it. We treat them more gently and kinder because they went through trauma and suffered. 
			  id:: be45e2b9-6b9b-489f-8980-5697ef0083c4
		- Life is not a competition
			- In our pursuit for the feeling of superiority it's okay for us to move forward one step at a time without feeling the need to compare ourselves to others.
			  id:: 821da5b3-a272-4e52-948c-0a71d5022896
			- > A healthy feeling of inferiority is not something that comes from comparing oneself to others; it comes from one's comparison with one's ideal self.
			  id:: 9a0587eb-3881-476f-adfd-83e574249da5
			- When we are trying to be our authentic and unique self, competition will get in the way. #blck:yellow
				- In competition, there are winners and losers. When we are aware and conscious of defeat and winning, comparisons will be made and self-judgment will lead to inferiority and superiority complexes.
					- In competitions, we can start to see others not only as rivals but eventually enemies. Cooperation and collaboration become strained, even though most problems require that type of spirit for success.
						- The world then becomes a terrifying place as we are afraid that others are out to get us and judge us harshly.
		- Competition mindset
		  id:: 2860a002-3bc6-491f-a58e-1ebeb61493d0
			- A competition mindset is endless and destructive. There will be many battles of losing and wining but the war will never end. 
			  id:: f8e775bb-6b8e-4d1f-9e8f-39a40c293c59
			- ((8c33a940-6c7d-43f8-92dc-2bb560ff982b))
			- Righteous [[indignation]] goes beyond one's interest while anger as a personal grudge is a tool used for others to submit. We use it to feel good about the decisions and actions we take that we think we are right in. 
			  id:: 56505825-253c-415d-bfc4-0c3823e3c2ff
			-
		- Emotions as communication tools
			- Anger is a form of communication and that form  of communication can still happen without anger
			  id:: 7f791653-8df8-4a9a-925d-380574868acf
		- Power Struggles
			- In power struggles no matter how much we think we are right, don't criticize the other person on that basis
			- When we are convinced we are right we are saying that the other person is wrong. We are stepping on a power struggle. This leads to "I have to win" mindset, which is hardly the goal of the conversation in the first place.
				- When we think we are right we should end there. We don't need to enter a power struggle and force others to submit to us. Conversations become no longer about correct information. It becomes losing or winning, and no likes to lose.
					- This makes people resist admitting they are wrong because we equate it to losing.
					- #[[decision making]] This mindset is not a healthy view of learning and updating our knowledge when we are hung up on winning or losing. We lose the ability to make the right decisions.
						- To make the correct choices we need to walk away from a competitive mindset.
		- Change #change #influence
			- Adlerian psychology is a psychology of changing one's self not a psychology for changing others.
				- Instead of waiting for others to change or for the situation to change, you can take the first step forward to institute the needed change.
			- #love #relationships
				- Love in which people restrict each other eventually falls apart. Love that feels oppressive and strained.
				- Sometimes we create or over exaggerate flaws in people so we can end our relationships with them.
					- When we do this we shift responsibility of the life task by shifting it to others so we can avoid dealing with it ourselves.
- **Takeaways*
	- Many of our self-esteem and self-image issues stems from the competitive and comparative interpretations we have of the world and the people around us. We often see someone more successful, beautiful, and wealthy and we fall short when we compare ourselves to them.
	  id:: ff008c55-ec0f-496d-a1ab-8dfa1a8fb379
		- Life becomes a competition when we create these comparison, instead of gaining happiness from comparing our present state to our ideal self image.  
		  id:: 7171594c-0851-44b1-9ce3-90d05531b5b0
		- We can feel happy on a daily basis through contentment that we are improving ourselves each day.
		  id:: bbab6f0e-49d1-4a9b-b0db-ecb3230d6a1e
	- Our feelings of inferiority are subjective interpretations. We need to ask ourselves if these negative feelings we hold to and cling to are crutches to our inability and fear of taking action and facing challenges to meet our goals and missions.
	  id:: e138976d-1ed4-4ed4-9408-258a8aee9829
		- When we enter in relationships it is inevitable we will be hurt and hurt others. We can take this fact and meet our challenges even when there the social cost of possible embarrassment.
		  id:: 33ac1926-270a-499e-918a-1adcff9aeb9f
		- We need to keep in mind that the subjectivity of the world, allows us to take positive interpretations and actions instead of defaulting to a negative view of the events around us.

- #[[Reference Notes]]
	- When one is trying to be oneself, competition will inevitably get in the way.
	- Adlerian psychology denies the need to seek recognition from others.
	- There is no need to be recognized by others. Actually, one must not seek recognition. This point cannot be overstated.
	- Why is it that people seek recognition from others? In many cases, it is due to the influence of reward-and-punishment education.
	- Adler was very critical of education by reward and punishment. It leads to mistaken lifestyles in which people think, If no one is going to praise me, I won’t take appropriate action and If no one is going to punish me, I’ll engage in inappropriate actions, too. You already have the goal of wanting to be praised when you start picking up litter. And if you aren’t praised by anyone, you’ll either be indignant or decide that you’ll never do such a thing again. Clearly, there’s something wrong with this situation.
	- You are not living to satisfy other people’s expectations, and neither am I. It is not necessary to satisfy other people’s expectations.
	- Wishing so hard to be recognized will lead to a life of following expectations held by other people who want you to be “this kind of person.” In other words, you throw away who you really are and live other people’s lives. And please remember this: If you are not living to satisfy other people’s expectations, it follows that other people are not living to satisfy your expectations. Someone might not act the way you want him to, but it doesn’t do to get angry. That’s only natural.
	- 8. When trying to be recognized by others, almost all people treat satisfying other people’s expectations as the means to that end. And that is in accordance with the stream of thought of reward-and-punishment education that says one will be praised if one takes appropriate action.
	- 9. If, for example, the main point of your job turns out to be satisfying other people’s expectations, then that job is going to be very hard on you. Because you’ll always be worried about other people looking at you and fear their judgment, and you are repressing your “I-ness.”
	- 10. We need to think with the perspective of “Whose task is this?” and continually separate one’s own tasks from other people’s tasks. YOUTH:
	- 11. We need to think with the perspective of “Whose task is this?” and continually separate one’s own tasks from other people’s tasks.
	- 12. In general, all interpersonal relationship troubles are caused by intruding on other people’s tasks, or having one’s own tasks intruded on. Carrying out the separation of tasks is enough to change one’s interpersonal relationships dramatically.
	- 13. One has to pay attention. Adlerian psychology does not recommend the noninterference approach. Noninterference is the attitude of not knowing, and not even being interested in knowing what the child is doing. Instead, it is by knowing what the child is doing that one protects him. If it’s studying that is the issue, one tells the child that that is his task, and one lets him know that one is ready to assist him whenever he has the urge to study. But one must not intrude on the child’s task. When no requests are being made, it does not do to meddle in things.
	- 14. Naturally, one gives all the assistance one possibly can. But beyond that, one doesn’t intrude. Remember the old saying, “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” Please think of counseling and all other assistance provided to other people in Adlerian psychology as having that kind of stance. Forcing change while ignoring the person’s intentions will only lead to an intense reaction.
	- 15. That is what separating is. You are worried about other people looking at you. You are worried about being judged by other people. That is why you are constantly craving recognition from others. Now, why are you worried about other people looking at you, anyway? Adlerian psychology has an easy answer. You haven’t done the separation of tasks yet. You assume that even things that should be other people’s tasks are your own. Remember the words of the grandmother: “You’re the only one who’s worried how you look.” Her remark drives right to the heart of the separation of tasks. What other people think when they see your face—that is the task of other people and is not something you have any control over.
	- 16. We are all suffering in interpersonal relationships. It might be the relationship with one’s parents or one’s elder brother, and it might be the interpersonal relationships at one’s workplace. Now, last time, you were saying that you wanted some specific steps. This is what I propose. First, one should ask, “Whose task is this?” Then do the separation of tasks. Calmly delineate up to what point one’s own tasks go, and from what point they become another person’s tasks. And do not intervene in other people’s tasks, or allow even a single person to intervene in one’s own tasks. This is a specific and revolutionary viewpoint that is unique to Adlerian psychology and contains the potential to utterly change one’s interpersonal relationship problems.
	- 17. For instance, when reading a book, if one brings one’s face too close to it, one cannot see anything. In the same way, forming good interpersonal relationships requires a certain degree of distance. When the distance gets too small and people become stuck together, it becomes impossible to even speak to each other.
	- 18. But the distance must not be too great, either. Parents who scold their children too much become mentally very distant. When this happens, the child can no longer even consult the parents, and the parents can no longer give the proper assistance. One should be ready to lend a hand when needed but not encroach on the person’s territory. It is important to maintain this kind of moderate distance.
	- 19. Of course. Earlier you said that the separation of tasks is something that treads on the other person’s goodwill. That is a notion that is tied to reward. It’s the idea that when another person does something for you, you have to do something in return—even if that person does not want anything. Rather than responding to the goodwill, it is just being tied to reward. No matter what sort of appeal the other person might make, you are the only one who decides what you should do.
	- 20. Yes. When reward is at the base of an interpersonal relationship, there’s a feeling that wells up in one that says, “I gave this much, so you should give me that much back.” This is a notion that is quite different from separation of tasks, of course. We must not seek reward, and we must not be tied to it.
	- 21. When Alexander the Great cut the Gordian knot, there were probably those who felt the same way: that the unraveling of the knot by hand had meaning, and that it was a mistake to cut it with a sword; that Alexander had misunderstood the meaning of the oracle’s words. In Adlerian psychology, there are aspects that are antithetical to normal social thinking. It denies etiology, denies trauma, and adopts teleology. It treats people’s problems as interpersonal relationship problems. And the not-seeking of recognition and the separation of tasks, too, are probably antithetical to normal social thinking.
	- 22. Maybe it is easier to live in such a way as to satisfy other people’s expectations. Because one is entrusting one’s own life to them. For example, one runs along the tracks that one’s parents have laid out. Even if there are a lot of things one might object to, one will not lose one’s way as long as one stays on those rails. But if one is deciding one’s path oneself, it’s only natural that one will get lost at times. One comes up against the wall of “how one should live.”
	- 23. It is true that there is no person who wishes to be disliked. But look at it this way: What should one do to not be disliked by anyone? There is only one answer: It is to constantly gauge other people’s feelings while swearing loyalty to all of them. If there are ten people, one must swear loyalty to all ten. When one does that, for the time being one will have succeeded in not being disliked by anyone. But at this point, there is a great contradiction looming. One swears loyalty to all ten people out of the single-minded desire to not be disliked. This is like a politician who has fallen into populism and begun to make impossible promises and accept responsibilities that are beyond him. Naturally, his lies will come to light before long. He will lose people’s trust and turn his own life into one of greater suffering. And, of course, the stress of continual lying has all kinds of consequences.
	- 24. other people’s expectations, and one is entrusting one’s own life to others, that is a way of living in which one is lying to oneself and continuing that lying to include the people around one.
	- 25. If one is living in a such a way as to satisfy other people’s expectations, and one is entrusting one’s own life to others, that is a way of living in which one is lying to oneself and continuing that lying to include the people around one.
	- 26. Separating one’s tasks is not an egocentric thing. Intervening in other people’s tasks is essentially an egocentric way of thinking, however. Parents force their children to study; they meddle in their life and marriage choices. That is nothing other than an egocentric way of thinking.
	- 27. Not wanting to be disliked by other people. To human beings, this is an entirely natural desire, and an impulse. Kant, the giant of modern philosophy, called this desire “inclination.”
	- 28. To live in such a way is only to be a slave to one’s desires and impulses. Real freedom is an attitude akin to pushing up one’s tumbling self from below.
	- 29. The desire for recognition is probably a natural desire. So are you going to keep rolling downhill in order to receive recognition from others? Are you going to wear yourself down like a rolling stone, until everything is smoothed away? When all that is left is a little round ball, would that be “the real I”? It cannot be.
	- 30. We are beings who are capable of resisting inclination. We can stop our tumbling selves and climb uphill. The desire for recognition is probably a natural desire. So are you going to keep rolling downhill in order to receive recognition from others? Are you going to wear yourself down like a rolling stone, until everything is smoothed away? When all that is left is a little round ball, would that be “the real I”? It cannot be.
	- 31. As I have stated repeatedly, in Adlerian psychology, we think that all problems are interpersonal relationship problems. In other words, we seek release from interpersonal relationships. We seek to be free from interpersonal relationships. However, it is absolutely impossible to live all alone in the universe. In light of what we have discussed until now, the conclusion we reach regarding “What is freedom?” should be clear.
	- 32. It’s that you are disliked by someone. It is proof that you are exercising your freedom and living in freedom, and a sign that you are living in accordance with your own principles.
	- 33. In short, that “freedom is being disliked by other people.”
	- 34. But conducting oneself in such a way as to not be disliked by anyone is an extremely unfree way of living, and is also impossible. There is a cost incurred when one wants to exercise one’s freedom. And the cost of freedom in interpersonal relationships is that one is disliked by other people.
	- 35. Unless one is unconcerned by other people’s judgments, has no fear of being disliked by other people, and pays the cost that one might never be recognized, one will never be able to follow through in one’s own way of living. That is to say, one will not be able to be free.
	- 36. One neither prepares to be self-righteous nor becomes defiant. One just separates tasks. There may be a person who does not think well of you, but that is not your task. And again, thinking things like He should like me or I’ve done all this, so it’s strange that he doesn’t like me, is the reward-oriented way of thinking of having intervened in another person’s tasks. One moves forward without fearing the possibility of being disliked. One does not live as if one were rolling downhill, but instead climbs the slope that lies ahead.
	- 37. One neither prepares to be self-righteous nor becomes defiant. One just separates tasks. There may be a person who does not think well of you, but that is not your task. And again, thinking things like He should like me or I’ve done all this, so it’s strange that he doesn’t like me, is the reward-oriented way of thinking of having intervened in another person’s tasks. One moves forward without fearing the possibility of being disliked. One does not live as if one were rolling downhill, but instead climbs the slope that lies ahead. That is freedom for a human being.
	- 38. Yes. Many people think that the interpersonal relationship cards are held by the other person. That is why they wonder, How does that person feel about me? and end up living in such a way as to satisfy the wishes of other people. But if they can grasp the separation of tasks, they will notice that they are holding all the cards. This is a new way of thinking.
	- 39. forming good interpersonal relationships requires a certain degree of distance. At the same time, people who get too close end up not even being able to speak to each other, so it is not good to get too far apart, either. Please do not think of the separation of tasks as something that is meant to keep other people away; instead, see it as a way of thinking with which to unravel the threads of the complex entanglement of one’s interpersonal relations.
	- 40. separation of tasks as a prescription for resolving interpersonal relationship problems. But interpersonal relationships are not something that end just because one has separated the tasks. The separating of tasks is actually the point of departure for interpersonal relations.
	- 41. The Goal of Interpersonal Relationships Is a Feeling of Community
	- 42. If other people are our comrades, and we live surrounded by them, we should be able to find in that life our own place of “refuge.” Moreover, in doing so, we should begin to have the desire to share with our comrades, to contribute to the community. This sense of others as comrades, this awareness of “having one’s own refuge,” is called “community feeling.”
	- 43. When Adler refers to community, he goes beyond the household, school, workplace, and local society, and treats it as all-inclusive, covering not only nations and all of humanity but also the entire axis of time from the past to the future—and he includes plants and animals and even inanimate objects.
	- 44. In other words, he is espousing that community is not merely one of the preexisting frameworks that the word might bring to mind but is also inclusive of literally everything—the entire universe, from the past to the future.
	- 45. Interpersonal relations are the source of unhappiness. And the opposite can be said, too—interpersonal relations are the source of happiness. YOUTH:
	- 46. Interpersonal relations are the source of unhappiness. And the opposite can be said, too—interpersonal relations are the source of happiness.
	- 47. community feeling is the most important index for considering a state of interpersonal relations that is happy.
	- 48. Community feeling is also referred to as “social interest,” that is to say, “interest in society.”
	- 49. Society’s smallest unit, huh? I’d say the family. PHILOSOPHER: No, it is “you and I.” When there are two people, society emerges in their presence, and community emerges there too. To gain an understanding of the community feeling that Adler speaks of, it is advisable to use “you and I” as the starting point.
	- 50. Consider the reality of the desire for recognition. How much do others pay attention to you, and what is their judgment of you? That is to say, how much do they satisfy your desire? People who are obsessed with such a desire for recognition will seem to be looking at other people, while they are actually looking only at themselves. They lack concern for others and are concerned solely with the “I.” Simply put, they are self-centered.
	- 51. but all people who are attached to the “I” are self-centered. And that is precisely why it is necessary to make the switch from “attachment to self” to “concern for others.”
	- 52. In Adlerian psychology, however, a sense of belonging is something that one can attain only by making an active commitment to the community of one’s own accord, and not simply by being here.
	- 53. One faces one’s life tasks. In other words, one takes steps forward on one’s own, without avoiding the tasks of the interpersonal relations of work, friendship, and love. If you are “the center of the world,” you will have no thoughts whatsoever regarding commitment to the community; because everyone else is “someone who will do something for me,” and there is no need for you to do things yourself. But you are not the center of the world, and neither am I.
	- 54. Living in fear of one’s relationships falling apart is an unfree way to live, in which one is living for other people.
	- 55. Yes, of course. Do not cling to the small community right in front of you. There will always be more “you and I,” and more “everyone,” and larger communities that exist.
	- 56. Do not cling to the small community right in front of you. There will always be more “you and I,” and more “everyone,” and larger communities that exist.
	- 57. Whether we praise or rebuke others, the only difference is one of the carrot or the stick, and the background goal is manipulation. The reason Adlerian psychology is highly critical of reward-and-punishment education is that its intention is to manipulate children.
	- 58. One wishes to be praised by someone. Or conversely, one decides to give praise to someone. This is proof that one is seeing all interpersonal relationships as “vertical relationships.” This holds true for you, too: It is because you are living in vertical relationships that you want to be praised. Adlerian psychology refutes all manner of vertical relationships and proposes that all interpersonal relationships be horizontal relationships. In a sense, this point may be regarded as the fundamental principle of Adlerian psychology.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2147-2151
	- 59. It is precisely because one perceives interpersonal relations as vertical, and sees the other party as beneath one, that one intervenes. Through intervention, one tries to lead the other party in the desired direction. One has convinced oneself that one is right and that the other party is wrong. Of course, the intervention here is manipulation, pure and simple. Parents commanding a child to study is a typical example of this. They might be acting out of the best of intentions from their points of view, but when it comes down to it, the parents are intruding and attempting to manipulate the child to go in their desired direction.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2173-2177
	- 60. Concretely speaking, instead of commanding from above that the child must study, one acts on him in such a way that he can gain the confidence to take care of his own studies and face his tasks on his own.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2188-2189
	- 61. That’s right, one neither praises nor rebukes. This kind of assistance, which is based on horizontal relationships, is referred to in Adlerian psychology as “encouragement.”
		- Your Highlight on Location 2194-2195
	- 62. When one is not following through with one’s tasks, it is not because one is without ability. Adlerian psychology tells us that the issue here is not one of ability but simply that “one has lost the courage to face one’s tasks.” And if that is the case, the thing to do before anything else is to recover that lost courage.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2197-2199

	- 64. Being praised essentially means that one is receiving judgment from another person as “good.” And the measure of what is good or bad about that act is that person’s yardstick. If receiving praise is what one is after, one will have no choice but to adapt to that person’s yardstick and put the brakes on one’s own freedom. “Thank you,” on the other hand, rather than being judgment, is a clear expression of gratitude. When one hears words of gratitude, one knows that one has made a contribution to another person.

	- 66. If one is able to feel one has worth, then one can accept oneself just as one is and have the courage to face one’s life tasks. So the issue that arises at this point is how on earth can one become able to feel one has worth?
		- Your Highlight on Location 2242-2244
	- 67. It’s quite simple. It is when one is able to feel “I am beneficial to the community” that one can have a true sense of one’s worth. This is the answer that would be offered in Adlerian psychology.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2245-2247
	- 68. So let’s look at other people not on the “level of acts” but on the “level of being.” Without judging whether or not other people did something, one rejoices in their being there, in their very existence, and one calls out to them with words of gratitude.

	- 69. With regard to this issue of community feeling, there was a person who asked Adler a similar question. Adler’s reply was the following: “Someone has to start. Other people might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: you should start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not.” My advice is exactly the same.

	- 70. This is a very important point. Does one build vertical relationships, or does one build horizontal relationships? This is an issue of lifestyle, and human beings are not so clever as to be able to have different lifestyles available whenever the need arises. In other words, deciding that one is “equal to this person” or “in a hierarchical relationship with that person” does not work.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2339-2342
	- 71. On the other hand, if one has managed to build a horizontal relationship with at least one person—if one has been able to build a relationship of equals in the true sense of the term—that is a major lifestyle transformation. With that breakthrough, all one’s interpersonal relations will gradually become horizontal.

I am not telling you to make friends with everyone, or behave as if you are close friends. Rather, what is important is to be equal in consciousness, and to assert that which needs to be asserted.

	- 75. There is a clear difference. Self-affirmation is making suggestions to oneself, such as “I can do it” or “I am strong,” even when something is simply beyond one’s ability. It is a notion that can bring about a superiority complex, and may even be termed a way of living in which one lies to oneself. With self-acceptance, on the other hand, if one cannot do something, one is simply accepting “one’s incapable self” as is and moving forward so that one can do whatever one can. It is not a way of lying to oneself. To put it more simply, say you’ve got a score of 60 percent, but you tell yourself, I just happened to get unlucky this time around, and the real me is 100 percent. That is self-affirmation. By contrast, if one accepts oneself as one is, as 60 percent, and thinks to oneself, How should I go about getting closer to 100 percent?—that is self-acceptance.

	- 76. One cannot change what one is born with. But one can, under one’s own power, go about changing what use one makes of that equipment. So in that case, one simply has to focus on what one can change, rather than on what one cannot. This is what I call self-acceptance.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2481-2483
	- 77. First, when we speak of trust, we are referring to something that comes with set conditions. We refer to it as credit. For example, when one wants to borrow money from a bank, one has to have some kind of security. The bank calculates the amount of the loan based on the value of that security, and says, “We will lend you this much.” The attitude of “We will lend it to you on the condition that you will pay it back” or “We will lend you as much as you are able to pay back” is not one of having confidence in someone. It is trust.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2503-2506
	- 78. By contrast, from the standpoint of Adlerian psychology, the basis of interpersonal relations is founded not on trust but on confidence.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2508-2509
	- 79. It is doing without any set conditions whatsoever when believing in others. Even if one does not have sufficient objective grounds for trusting someone, one believes. One believes unconditionally without concerning oneself with such things as security. That is confidence.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2510-2512
	- 80. The way to understand Adlerian psychology is simple. Right now, you are thinking, If I were to have confidence in someone unconditionally, I would just get taken advantage of. However, you are not the one who decides whether or not to take advantage. That is the other person’s task. All you need to do is think, What should I do? If you are telling yourself, I’ll give it to him if he isn’t going take advantage of me, it is just a relationship of trust that is based on security or conditions.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2534-2537
	- 81. Adlerian psychology is not saying “have confidence in others unconditionally” on the basis of a moralistic system of values. Unconditional confidence is a means for making your interpersonal relationship with a person better and for building a horizontal relationship. If you do not have the desire to make your relationship with that person better, then go ahead and sever it. Because carrying out the severing is your task.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2543-2546
	- 82. Right now, you are only concerned about the times you were taken advantage of, and nothing else. You focus only on the pain from the wounds you sustained on such occasions. But if you are afraid to have confidence in others, in the long run you will not be able to build deep relationships with anyone.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2560-2562
	- 83. If it is a shallow relationship, when it falls apart the pain will be slight. And the joy that relationship brings each day will also be slight. It is precisely because one can gain the courage to enter into deeper relationships by having confidence in others that the joy of one’s interpersonal relations can grow, and one’s joy in life can grow, too. YOUTH: No! That’s not what I was talking about, you’re changing the subject again. The courage to overcome the fear of being taken advantage of—where does it come from? PHILOSOPHER: It comes from self-acceptance. If one can simply accept oneself as one is, and ascertain what one can do and what one cannot, one becomes able to understand that “taking advantage” is the other person’s task, and getting to the core of “confidence in others” becomes less difficult. YOUTH: You’re saying that taking advantage of someone is the other person’s task, and one can’t do anything about it? That I should be resigned, in an affirmative way? Your arguments always ignore our emotions. What does one do about all the anger and sadness one feels when one is taken advantage of? PHILOSOPHER: When one is sad, one should be sad to one’s heart’s content. It is precisely when one tries to escape the pain and sadness that one gets stuck and ceases to be able to build deep relationships with anyone. Think about it this way. We can believe. And we can doubt. But we are aspiring to see others as our comrades. To believe or to doubt—the choice should be clear. The Essence of Work Is a Contribution to the Common Good YOUTH: All right.

		- Your Highlight on Location 2580-2582
	- 87. Exactly. In effect, placing confidence in others is connected to seeing others as comrades. It is because they are one’s comrades that one can have confidence in them. If they were not one’s comrades, one would not be able to reach the level of confidence. And then, having other people as one’s comrades connects to finding refuge in the community one belongs to. So one can gain the sense of belonging, that “it’s okay to be here.” YOUTH: In other words, you’re saying that to feel “it’s okay to be here,” one has to see others as comrades.

	- 89. Contribution to others does not connote self-sacrifice. Adler goes so far as to warn that those who sacrifice their own lives for others are people who have conformed to society too much. And please do not forget: We are truly aware of our own worth only when we feel that our existence and behavior are beneficial to the community, that is to say, when one feels “I am of use to someone.” Do you remember this? In other words, contribution to others, rather than being about getting rid of the “I” and being of service to someone, is actually something one does in order to be truly aware of the worth of the “I.”

The children have gone off to their rooms, and the husband is sitting on the sofa watching television. It’s been left to the wife (me) to do the dishes and clear everything up. To make matters worse, the family takes that for granted, and they don’t make the slightest effort to help. In such a situation, normally one would think, Why won’t they give me a hand? or Why do I have to do all the work? Even if I do not hear the words “thank you” from my family while I am cleaning up, I want them to think that I am of use to the family. Instead of thinking about what others can do for me, I want to think about, and put into practice, what I can do for other people. Just by having that feeling of contribution, the reality right in front of me will take on a completely different hue. In fact, if I am grumbling to myself as I wash the dishes, I am probably not much fun to be around, so everyone just wants to keep their distance. On the other hand, if I’m humming away to myself and washing the dishes in good spirits, the children might come and give me a hand. At the very least, I’d be creating an atmosphere in which it is easier for them to offer their help.

If I cannot do that, inevitably there will be thoughts running through my head like, Why am I the only one doing this? and Why won’t anyone give me a hand? Contribution that is carried out while one is seeing other people as enemies may indeed lead to hypocrisy.

	- 93. For the sake of convenience, up to this point I have discussed self-acceptance, confidence in others, and contribution to others, in that order. However, these three are linked as an indispensable whole, in a sort of circular structure. It is because one accepts oneself just as one is—one self-accepts—that one can have “confidence in others” without the fear of being taken advantage of. And it is because one can place unconditional confidence in others, and feel that people are one’s comrades, that one can engage in “contribution to others.” Further, it is because one contributes to others that one can have the deep awareness that “I am of use to someone” and accept oneself just as one is. One can self-accept.

Namely, that the feeling of “I am beneficial to the community” or “I am of use to someone” is the only thing that can give one a true awareness that one has worth.
		- Your Highlight on Location 2763-2765
	- 96. If one really has a feeling of contribution, one will no longer have any need for recognition from others. Because one will already have the real awareness that “I am of use to someone,” without needing to go out of one’s way to be acknowledged by others. In other words, a person who is obsessed with the desire for recognition does not have any community feeling yet, and has not managed to engage in self-acceptance, confidence in others, or contribution to others.

And it is precisely for this reason that when being especially good becomes a lost cause, one makes the huge leap to being especially bad—the opposite extreme. But is being normal, being ordinary, really such a bad thing? Is it something inferior? Or, in truth, isn’t everybody normal? It is necessary to think this through to its logical conclusion.

	- 98. Adlerian psychology has a different standpoint. People who think of life as being like climbing a mountain are treating their own existences as lines. As if there is a line that started the instant one came into this world, and that continues in all manner of curves of varying sizes until it arrives at the summit, and then at long last reaches its terminus, which is death. This conception, which treats life as a kind of story, is an idea that links with Freudian etiology (the attributing of causes), and is a way of thinking that makes the greater part of life into something that is “en route.”

The fact that you think you can see the past, or predict the future, is proof that rather than living earnestly here and now, you are living in a dim twilight. Life is a series of moments, and neither the past nor the future exists. You are trying to give yourself a way out by focusing on the past and the future. What happened in the past has nothing whatsoever to do with your here and now, and what the future may hold is not a matter to think about here and now. If you are living earnestly here and now, you will not be concerned with such things.

To be sure, likening one’s life to a story is probably an entertaining job. The problem is, one can see the dimness that lies ahead at the end of the story. Moreover, one will try to lead a life that is in line with that story. And then one says, “My life is such-and-such, so I have no choice but to live this way, and it’s not because of me—it’s my past, it’s the environment,” and so on. But bringing up the past here is nothing but a way out, a life-lie. However, life is a series of dots, a series of moments. If you can grasp that, you will not need a story any longer.

This is a way of living that postpones life. As long as we postpone life, we can never go anywhere and will pass our days only one after the next in dull monotony, because we think of here and now as just a preparatory period, as a time for patience. But a “here and now” in which one is studying for an entrance examination in the distant future, for example, is the real thing.
