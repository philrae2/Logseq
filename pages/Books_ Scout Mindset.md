- Introduction
	 - A [[Scout Mindset]] is the motivation to see things as they are, not as you wish they were. It helps us from fooling ourselves.

		 - A scout mindset allows you to recognize where you are wrong and to seek out your blind spots through thorough testing of your assumptions. Armed with this information you can quickly course correct.

			 - This is motivated by [[Richard Feynman]]'s quote of __The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.__

			 - Wanting your "map"—your perception of yourself and the world—to be as accurate as possible
				 - #rethinking This means understanding and knowing the limitations of our knowledge and thinking processes. It means testing and seeking to be proven false in our knowledge base, so we are open to changing our minds and updating our beliefs. 

	 - Knowing that you should test your assumptions doesn't automatically improve your judgement.

		 - Our judgement isn't limited by knowledge nearly as much as it's limited by attitude

	 - Goals of this book
		 - Realize that truth isn't in conflict with your other goals
			 - Positive thinking would lead us to believe to ignore reality and put on an overconfident attitude to chase success for our goals. 
				 - However many entrepreneurs were realistic in starting their businesses. Jeff Bezos warned his early investors that the chance for success of Amazon was on 30% and Elon Musk even lower at 10%/.

		 - Learn tools that make it easier to see clearly

		 - Appreciate the emotional rewards of scout mindset

- Chapter 1 - Two types of thinking
	 - Directionally motivated reasoning or simply motivated reasoning (Soldier Mindset)
		 - our unconscious motives affect the conclusions we draw #bias

		 - Examples: Thinking we are doing more than anyone else at our jobs, or if someone fails they are bad at their job, but we make excuses for our [[mistakes]]

		 - The difficulty with [[motivated reasoning]] is that when we inadvertently fall into this bias, it doesn't feel like we've employed it ourselves. 
			 - When we're reasoning, we assess ourselves as objective, fair-minded, and removed from our emotions.

			 - Our beliefs can be entrenched if align them and equate them to our identity. #identity 

			 - [[Dreyfus Affair]] is an example of overcoming one's internal biases for searching for the truth. Picquart was anti-Semitic and was searching for full proof of Dreyfus' guilt. But when unable to find strong evidence for Dreyfus' guilt was able to rethink and change his mind.

		 - Our [[judgment]] is improved if we can avoid distorting our perception of reality

		 - Question the underlying foundations of the problem, and question the information feeding into your problem or question your undertaking. 
			 - Question your actions and processes.

			 - ((aab3f59b-106c-4b55-bac0-930abc1b524f))

			 - Consider the likelihood of failures and the reasons for failures. #postmortem #backcasting

			 - Lawyers cite objectivity and self-skepticism as the most important skills they had to learn over their careers.
				 - They need to be able to form an accurate assessment on the strengths and weaknesses of their case.

		 - #rethinking A scout mindset is required if we are able to reconsider other interpretations—or even believe other reasonable interpretations exist.

		 - Developing a Scout Mindset
			 - #[[automatic behaviors]] A helpful tool is to always validate the information or data that drives your actions or decisions to build up a [[Scout Mindset]]
id:: c8c47c98-422c-4451-ba32-2ff94201a1c7

			 - Genuine searching desire for the truth, even if it's not what we hope for or is embarrassing for us.

			 - #testing Willingness to test our theories and awareness that our knowledge and understanding could be build on false information.

- Chapter 2 - Soldier mindset (Motivated reasoning)
	 - The soldier mindset marries our identity to the rightness of our beliefs. Therefore we are prone to protecting ourselves by clinging to our belief systems and are resistant to examine them for [[rethinking]] and validation.

	 - #[[change management]] When we try to advocate for something to change, we should make sure that we understand why it is the way it is in the first place. 
		 - Absence of evidence is not evidence and therefore we shouldn't act or decide without confirming the original justifications of the things we are trying to reform.

	 - What function does [[motivated reasoning]] serve?
		 - Comfort, self-esteem, and morale are emotional benefits to ourselves. Therefore the target of our deceptions is ourselves. #self-deception. 
			 - Comfort: Avoiding unpleasant emotions
				 - A motivated reasoning mindset helps us avoid negative emotions like fear, stress, and regret. 
					 - We can do this by adopting a false and comforting narrative and choose not to scrutinize them too deeply. We can also simply deny reality. 

			 - Self-esteem: feeling good about ourselves
				 - We adopt flattering narratives about ourselves to shield us from unflattering facts.  
					 - Example: I may not be wealthy, but that's because I have integrity. The reason I don't have a lot of friends is because people are intimidated by me.  

				 - #overconfidence Many false beliefs can get incorporated into our identity to help defend our egos because they relate to our strengths and weaknesses.
					 - example: Poorer people tend to believe that luck has a significant impact on our station in life, while wealthier people tend to credit hard work and talent alone. 

					 - > Psychologists make a distinction between [[self-enhancement]], which means boosting your ego with positive beliefs, and [[self-protection]], which means avoiding blows to your ego. 
						 - Self-protection may be believing the worst in yourself so you don't get hurt by failing to meet high standards of others. 

			 - Morale: Motivating ourselves to do hard things
				 - We believe in false narratives and deny reality in hopes of achieving difficult goals. 

				 - When we need to make tough decisions we tend to avoid considering alternative plans or downsides to the current plan.  We often spend very little time comparing options. Instead, we quickly anchor on one option and spend most of the meeting raising points in favor of it.

		 - Targeting deception towards others
			 - Persuasion: Convincing ourselves so we can convince others
				 - First we need to fool ourselves convincingly and strongly enough for us to create a persuasive argument for others.

			 - Image: Choosing beliefs that make us look good
				 - Signaling and compression are choosing beliefs based on what message we want to convey to others even if we don't necessarily believe in them strongly.

			 - Belonging: Fitting in to your social groups
				 - We can choose to believe in ideas, and not very strongly, only for the sake of belonging. This noticeable in many religious groups where dissent can cause extreme alienation from your support group.

		 - Educating our motivated reasoning away has not been fruitful. 

- Chapter 3 - Why Truth is More Valuable Than We Realize
	 - As humans we make unconscious trade-offs in embracing truth, between judgment and belonging. If we live in a tight-knit community, we feel obligated to believe the tribe rather than openness to alternative views outside your community. 

	 - We trade off between judgment and persuasion. An example for this tradeoff, is when we're so good at persuading others to our cause yet, unable to correctly judge that our cause maybe wrong.

	 - How do we remain conscious of the [[unconscious bias]]es affecting our [[decision making]] in a natural way? #qq
		 - [[[[interval]]:2.5]] [[[[factor]]:2.35]] [[April 23rd, 2021]]

	 - [[rational irrationality]] hypothesis - the hypothesis that the human mind evolved the ability to make trade-off decisions.
		 - this means we're good at unconsciously choosing just enough epistemic irrationality to achieve our social and emotional goals, without impairing our judgment too much

		 - It uses the two different meanings of the word rational; one is epistemic rationality meaning holding beliefs that are well justified, while instrumental rationality means acting effectively to achieve your goals.

		 - A rationally irrational person would deny problems only when the comfort of denial is sufficiently high and their chance of fixing the problem is sufficiently low

		 - However we are far from rationally irrational, we have many biases that cause us to misjudge the costs and benefits of truth. 

	 - We overvalue the immediate rewards of the [[soldier mindset]]
		 - Our preference to procrastinate is coming from the [[present bias]], where we care too much about short-term consequences and too little about long-term consequences. 
			 - We are impatient and get more impatient as the potential rewards grow closer.

			 - An example is joining the gym, but in the morning the choice to sleep in has a more present short-term benefit than getting up and working out, with its long-term health benefits not readily seen until the long term.

			 - The soldier mindset also influences our thinking not only our behaviors, such as providing us emotional comfort. If we're worried about a mistake and convince ourselves it wasn't our fault we are immediately hit with the feeling of instant emotional relief.
				 - The tradeoff for instant emotional relief from denying our mistakes, the opportunity cost of learning from them. 

	 - We overestimate [[social cost]]
		 - We overestimate how we come across to other people. For example we lie to our doctors because we are embarrassed to be judged. 

		 - Social costs like looking weird or making a fool out of ourselves feel a lot more significant that they actually are. 
			 - In reality, people aren't thinking about us nearly as much as you intuitively think they are. Their opinions of you don't have nearly as much impact on your life as it feels like they do. We sacrifice a lot of potential happiness to avoid relatively small social costs. 

			 - The prospect of rejection is so stressful that we often rationalize that we don't want the thing we want or make up a silly and false excuse that we convince ourselves is true to escape rejection.

	 - We're overly tempted and naturally gravitate toward immediate payoffs, even when their consequences long term come at a steep cost. 
		 - We therefore underestimate or lie to ourselves the cost of embracing false beliefs and the cumulative benefits of practicing our habits. 

- Chapter 4 - Signs of a Scout
	 - Feeling objective doesn't make you a scout
		 - [[motivated reasoning]] makes us feel that our arguments and judgment are objective and fair when they aren't
			 - The more we judge ourselves as rational the more objective we think we are, the more we trust our intuitions and opinions as accurate representations of reality and the less inclined we are to question them or seek out alternative view points.

	 - Being smart and knowledgeable doesn't make you a scout
		 - Just because someone has an advanced degree in one field or has a high IQ may give them an advantage in a neutral domain like math or computer science, doesn't mean that those skills and talents transfer to other domains outside their skill, talent, or knowledge set

	 - Actually practicing a [[Scout Mindset]] makes you a scout
		 - Tell other people or acknowledge they are right and you are wrong.

		 - How do we react to personal criticism?
			 - Do we make it easy for others to give us criticisms and feedback?

		 - Do we seek out to prove ourselves wrong?

		 - Do you take precautions to avoid fooling yourselves?
			 - When looking at data do we try to remove factors that will create bias? 

		 - Do we have any good critics?

- Chapter 5 - Noticing Bias
	 - [[forcing]] is one tool our brain uses to allow us to fall into [[motivated reasoning]] while fooling us to think we are objective.
		 - Forcing is when we fully don't understand the situation because we know one reality and not the many other possible choices. People do this by only offering us one choice, and of course with no other option to compare to, we can position our current option as good or bad to promote [[motivated reasoning]]

		 - Our brains can use forcing easily on topics we've never we've never encountered before because we don't have preexisting principles to get in the way of choosing whatever answer is convenient for us in the case at hand. 

		 - Examples of forcing are: __"If you get sued and you win the case, should the person who sued you pay for your legal costs?__ vs __"If you sue someone and you lose the case, should you pay his costs?"__

	 - We can't examine our actions and thinking to detect [[motivated reasoning]]. We have to employ thought experiments to explore counterfactuals, where our motivations are different from what we have currently

	 - Common Thought experiments
		 - [[double standard test]] Are judging one person (or group) by a different standard than you would use for another (or group)

		 - [[outsider test]] How would you evaluate this situation if it wasn't your situation.

		 - [[conformity test]] If other people no longer held this view, would you still hold it?

		 - [[selective skeptic test]] If this evidence supported the other side, how credible would you judge it to be?

		 - [[status quo bias]] - may be motivated by our [[Loss Aversion]] where the pain we feel from a loss outweighs the pleasure we feel from a similar-size gain.
			 - This makes us reluctant to think about changing our situation clearly, even if the change would benefit us overall. We overemphasize the loss and ignore the gains.

- Chapter 6 - How Sure Are You?
	 - Our [[overconfidence]] in our opinions and judgment can come from our liking of feeling certain. [[Certainty]] is simple and comfortable. It makes us feel smart and competent.

	 - Though not all overconfidence is due to [[motivated reasoning]] but sometimes our lack of understanding of a topic or underestimating its complexity. We think arriving at the answer is easy.

	 - #[[skin in the game]] #[[Decision Making]] Making [[bet]]s is one way to check for [[certainty]]. If we feel like there's something to lose we are more likely be careful and thoughtful before taking action or speaking about an issue. 
id:: 737dfea5-a2d4-4aed-bd74-3e288f41e3df
		 - You can test your negative emotions and [[catastrophizing]] by making a bet of how honest and truthful your emotions are and if in the past you felt better after a few days.
id:: d3aa8ce8-4d08-485b-821b-f0618a30e22f

		 - You can hypothesize, if we have a third party observer judging the situations you're in, how much are you willing to win/lose $1000 if they agree or disagree with your assessments?

		 - We can also qualitatively assign a number to our confidence using the [[equivalent bet test]] 
			 - We bet $1000 on the scenario we want to find our confidence in compared to the chances of us picking a red ball out of X number of white balls. By changing the amounts of white balls and asking ourselves which we'd rather bet on—our scenario or the red ball—we can arrive at percent.

- Chapter 7 - Coping with Reality
	 - Coping Strategies for negative situations
		 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2Fry4Xw-UqSs.png?alt=media&token=57321306-0096-41e1-8bb4-fe68ebc571e2)

		 - Make a plan
			 - Making a plan for that takes the positive side of the negative event, can quickly diminish the self-defeating and negative thoughts you have about the situation. #self-image #catastrophizing

		 - Notice the silver lining
			 - Finding a positive within the negative situation can help us accept the reality, even if we don't like the situation. The small positive within the majority of negatives can help provide us comfort

		 - Focus on a different goal
			 - Make sure your goals are aligned to achieving the solution for the current situation you're in

		 - Things could be worse

- Chapter 8 - Motivation without self-deception
	 - The [[self-belief mindset]] is when we think positively, believe in ourselves, and work really hard we can achieve anything that we set our minds to. 
		 - The biggest problem with the [[self-belief mindset]] is that we're not thinking realistically and powering ourselves with sheer positive thinking. We don't take the time to think and ask ourselves realistic questions like "Is this goal desirable enough to be worth the risk?" and "Are there any other goals that would be similarly desirable but require less risk?"
			 - This mindset shuts out other options and forces us to cling to the choice we already made and soldier on, even if reality says we should abandon ship for more realistic waters.

			 - We do ourselves a great disservice if we don't ask ourselves. "Is this goal worth pursuing, compared to other things we could do instead?"

	 - The accurate picture of the odds help you adapt your plan over time
		 - We have to assess and reassess the realistic outlook of our plans and adapt or modify them according to our assessments. If we are honest with ourselves and accept what reality is telling us we not deceive ourselves. 

	 - An accurate picture of the odds help you decide how much to stake on success
		 - When chances of success are low, we can still take the risk of our time and resources on soldiering forward to a goal if success is worth it to us despite the odds of failure.
id:: 01d140aa-7109-49fe-afee-943c8f8fd801
			 - Elon Musk predicted that Tesla and Space X would only 10% successful.

			 - Jeff Bezos predicted a 30% chance of Amazon being successful. 

		 - An easier example of bets worth taking is win winning is disproportionately more beneficial than losing. Like if I win $200 every time I roll a 6 and lose $20 if any other number comes up. 

		 - We shouldn't fool ourselves that our success streak is mostly of our own skills or talents, luck and variability often play big roles in our [[success]]
			 - Over time our outcomes will fluctuate; some of our bets will turn out well, and many will turn out poorly. 

			 - Building [[variance]] into our decision-making process and expectations of our outcomes can keep us humble. Variance teaches us that not every success we have is solely attributable to our own actions.

		 - Accepting the possibility of [[failure]]  ahead of time isn't demoralizing or paralyzing, but liberating. It makes us bold and motivated to take action confidently and with courage to take on risks required to achieve something big. 

		 - When taking big risks with the [[soldier mindset]] we have to deceive ourselves to move forward. We believe as long as we think positively about ourselves that failure is not an option and "luck" is irrelevant to our success.

- Chapter 9 - [[Influence without Confidence]]
	 - Convention tells us that for people to be influential we have to be perceived as confident. 

	 - Types of confidence
		 - [[epistemic confidence]] - or certainty is how sure we are about what's true

		 - [[social confidence]] - or self-assurance: are we at ease in social situations? Do we act like we belong there. Are we secure in ourselves and our role in the group? Do we speak like we're worth listening to.

		 - We often conflate the two types of confidence, mixing and mistaking one for the other as if they both come packaged together. If someone is socially confident doesn't mean they should be trusted sources of knowledge and expertise. 

		 - Ben Franklin exhibited social confidence and intentionally portrayed a weak and lack of epistemic confidence to be more likeable and acceptable to the public at large. He noticed he was more believable if the didn't come off condescending.

		 - Abraham Lincoln too exhibited humbleness, and was quick to defer decisions to people he thought knew more about a certain subject. 

		 - People judge us on based on social confidence, not epistemic confidence
			 - When people judge us and form first impressions we are judged through our self-assurance rather than expressing certainty.
id:: f386eb7b-3e5c-4ed8-9bdb-aafcb5a823d3
				 - We can project self-assurance through our tone of voice, posture, and dress. 

	 - Two kinds of uncertainty
		 - Due to ignorance or inexperience - this type of uncertainty is unflattering and sounds like "__I mean, I don't really know how to explain it.__" or "__I haven't come across this before__" or "__I'm not quite sure what's causing your headaches__"
			 - We have to be careful not to project this type of uncertainty. Avoid not knowing, but rather you're uncertain but are actively pursuing a solution

		 - Another type of uncertainty refers to reality being messy and unpredictable.
			 - This type of uncertainty looks like "The evidence of breastfeeding is pretty weak. But one determining factor, which is stronger is age of first pregnancy..."

		 - Show uncertainty is justified
			 - Often our audience doesn't know how much variance and uncertainty may play in a specific knowledge domain. To set the correct expectations, inform them.

		 - Give informed estimates
			 - Give informed estimates and explain where they come from.
				 - "There's no hard data to rely on for this so I've taken the average estimate from three senior marketing managers. 

				 - Even though we acknowledge reality is difficult to predict or even dangerous to forecast, we can at least be confident in our analysis and assessments of the information we share. 

				 - We can show we are well-informed and prepared on a topic without overstating our certainty on it—it's not required. 

		 - Have a plan
			 - #planning #[[decision making]] People dislike [[uncertainty]] or hearing from uncertain people because it leaves people without a plan or dismantles their plans. If we are uncertain, then we hesitate on making plans or acting until we feel secure.
id:: 6bf4a6b9-36b8-43f7-9aa3-753a90022734
				 - To help people move forward, give enough information to help them feel a level of certainty to plan or take action

- Chapter 10-12
	 - Super forecasters change their minds all the time. We are more intelligent when we are capable of changing our minds and not seeing mistakes as negatives. 
		 - When we can recognize when and where we are wrong, we can make better decisions, judgments and forecasts in the future. 

	 - We need to think errors and mistakes as positive events in our lives.
		 - When we can freely accept our mistakes we are far quicker to revise and correct them to prevent and mitigate future failures. 

		 - We can view mistakes as opportunities to "update" our thinking and processes.

		 - We are also far more open-minded to other people's opinions and alternate viewpoints, rather than clinging to our own point of views.

		 - We can see errors as opportunities to getting our skills more correct and improved. We see mistakes and errors as less painful, something to feel appreciative of rather than to an embarrassing event that should be hidden.

		 - Being wrong doesn't mean we did something wrong, something we need to apologize for, but something we can share freely in a matter-of-fact manner.

		 - Knowing that you’re fallible doesn’t magically prevent you from being wrong. But it does allow you to set expectations early and often, which can make it easier to accept when you are wrong.

	 - We need to strive for constant learning and improvement
		 - If we're not doing something different in five years then we're doing something wrong. 
id:: 3b0b53ca-529d-44ad-8cbc-b9e031e479f5

	 - We need to see and accept reality instead of explaining away any inconsistencies to our point of view
		 - The longer we wait to deal with reality the bigger the price tag.

		 - We need to be quicker to ask ourselves "What am I interpreting in this scenario" when we encounter evidence that goes against our beliefs or inconsistencies creating a problem to our perception of reality. 

		 - If we want to be better at predicting people's behaviors, shrugging off or explaining away the times when they violate our expectations, is the wrong approach. 
			 - When we instinctively judge people or explain away their behaviors as stupid, irrational or crazy is a sign that there's something off with the situation. We can't write off the other side as crazy. 

			 - When there is the confusion we need to explore the reasoning behind it to find the truth. Often this information can lead us to the resolution of our problems.

			 - > It is when we hear or see something that doesn’t make sense—something ‘crazy’—that a crucial fork in the road is presented,” he writes. “[Push] forward, even more forcefully, into that which we initially can’t process; or take the other path, the one to guaranteed failure, in which we tell ourselves that negotiating was useless anyway.”

			 - It is better to investigate confusing situations because we don't know what we'll learn from them. It's not a good default option to always think that "I'm right" or the other guy is wrong. 

		 - The rule for paradigm shifts in life is the same as it is in science. Acknowledge anomalies, even if you don’t yet know how to explain them, and even if the old paradigm still seems correct overall. Maybe they’ll add up to nothing in particular. Maybe they just mean that reality is messy. But maybe they’re laying the groundwork for a big change of view.

		 - LEANING IN TO confusion is about inverting the way you’re used to seeing the world. Instead of dismissing observations that contradict your theories, get curious about them. Instead of writing people off as irrational when they don’t behave the way you think they should, ask yourself why their behavior might be rational. Instead of trying to fit confusing observations into your preexisting theories, treat them as clues to a new theory
			 - To give yourself the best chance of learning from disagreement, you should be listening to people who make it easier to be open to their arguments, not harder. People you like or respect, even if you don’t agree with them. People with whom you have some common ground—intellectual premises, or a core value that you share—even though you disagree with them on other issues. People whom you consider reasonable, who acknowledge nuance and areas of uncertainty, and who argue in good faith.
				 - Knowing that you have intellectual common ground with someone makes you more receptive to their arguments right off the bat. It also makes it possible for them to explain their side in your “language.”One of the biggest reasons we fail to learn from disagreements is that we expect it to be easier than it actually is. We assume that if both people are basically reasonable and arguing in good faith, then getting to the bottom of a disagreement should be straightforward: Each person explains what they believe, and if one person can support their position with logic and evidence, then the other says, “Oh, you’re right,” and changes their mind.

Simple!
			 - **We misunderstand each other's views**
				 - Even correct ideas often sound wrong when we first hear them especially when not explained with nuance and care. We often mistakenly assume a simplistic explanation is enough, even though we may be missing background context.

			 - **Bad arguments inoculate us against good arguments**
				 - We often misconstrue good arguments as bad arguments when they're new to us and lump them into the other bad arguments we heard from the past.

			 - **Our beliefs are interdependent—changing one requires changing others**

		 - 

	 - Most people implicitly believe that their views of reality, their maps, are correct. If they find that they have to revise their map, it becomes challenging to update their beliefs and view mistakes as something they messed up in. Improving their maps is a sign that they made a mistake along the way.
		 - a [[Scout Mindset]] has the opposite assumption. They assume that we have wildly inaccurate views of reality and the world, our maps are wrong, and overtime as we get more information, we can make them more accurate. Revising and update our map is a sign that we're doing something wrong.

- Chapter 13 - How beliefs become identities
	 - Our beliefs can meld into our core identity through:
		 - Feeling embattled: When people are persecuted, mocked, or stigmatized for their beliefs they are more likely to cling to them and gain a sense of solidarity with other members standing with them.
			 - People can feel like their side is the embattled one even though they are the majority. 

		 - When source our pride in our belief, then it can become our identity. 

	 - How to identify a belief is our identity
		 - Using the words "I believe"

		 - Getting annoyed when an ideology is criticized

		 - Defiant language 
			 - Identifying with slogans and mottos like "Stand for up for science." 

		 - A righteous tone

		 - Gatekeeping
			 - When we limit or define who can claim a label

		 - Schadenfreude
			 - Deriving pleasure from news that humiliates some ideological group you disagree with is a sign of an "oppositional identity"—an identity defined by what it opposes.

		 - Epithets
			 - using words like snowflakes, feminazis, libtards

		 - Having to defend your view

		 - The more you've argued a position to other people, especially in public, the more it becomes linked to your ego and reputation, and the harder it is to abandon that position later.

	 - The problem when we allow our beliefs to define our identity is that it hinders our ability to think.
		 - We feel we have to defend our beliefs which leads us to [[motivated reasoning]] instead of finding opportunities to correct our thinking. We focus on collecting evidence in its favor. 

		 - Identity makes us reflexively reject arguments that feel like attacks on on you or the status of your group.

- Chapter 14 - Hold Your Identity Lightly
	 - Holding your identity means thinking of it as a factual matter that can change rather than a central source of pride and meaning in your life. It's a description of you in your current state, not your future state. It doesn't predict your behavior in the future.
		 - It allows our minds to be flexible, unconstrained by identity, and free to follow the evidence wherever it leads.

	 - The [[Ideological Turing Test]], suggested by economist Bryan Caplan, is a way to determine if you really understand an ideology. Can you explain it as a believer would, convincingly enough that other people couldn't tell the difference between you and and a genuine believer. 

	 - A strongly held identity prevents you from persuading others
		 - It's hard to change someone's mind when you feel morally and intellectually superior to them. 

	 - Understanding the other side makes it possible to change minds
		 - To effectively achieve our goals, we need to lightly hold our identities or risk making bad decisions and acting out negatively that our contrary to meeting our goals in defense of our identities.

- #identity
	 - Your [[community]] shapes your [[identity]]
		 - Depending on your environment and community, your  willingness to change can fluctuate. 
			 - In drama club we can easily change our minds, but in academia pursuing a PhD, we are less likely to show our [[mistake]]s and flexibility to change our minds.

		 - #rethinking 
			 - One of the easier ways to change our minds is to surround ourselves with people who are able to change their viewpoints. We are social creatures and our identities are shaped by our social circles.

	 - We can choose what kind of people we attract
		 - We have to be confident and honest with how we act and think even if we get criticism. The people who you attract will have the same mindset or appreciate who you are.

		 - Aim to please the kind of people you'd most like to have around you. Don't try to please everyone else.

		 - The people you read, follow, and talk to online helps to shape our identity, just like the people who we surround ourselves in real life.

- #rethinking #[[Critical Thinking]]
	 - If we want to be good at facing hard truths, changing our minds easily, taking criticism, and listening to people well we have to be willing to subject our conclusions to thorough scrutiny, double-checking results, and ultimately believing the data.
		 - This mindset has to be a deep personal value, it has to be something we take pride in. It can't feel like a chore.

	 - Changing your mind shouldn't feel embarrassing or shameful, it should feel invigorating, something that we can look forward to.
