- **Note:**
	- Give to people who will appreciate your work and not take advantage of you.
	- Who are we working for in [[OBI]]? Are we working for our own selves and image or are we working for our customers?
		- We can tell who we are working for by the actions we take. We can choose to be generous towards others like our coworkers or choose to take actions that benefit only ourselves.
