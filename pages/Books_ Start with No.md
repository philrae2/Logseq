- Chapter 1 - Your Greatest Weakness in [[Negotiation]]: The Dangers of Neediness
	- In your life as a negotiator, even in your life as a private citizen of the world, you are dealing with some serious predators who are looking for the slightest sign of distress and neediness.
		- ^^To be needy is to lose control and make bad decisions. #[[decision making]]^^
		- Today, in the 21st Century, were not truly needy. But we often use the word too often. "I need this jacket", "I need to make this call", "I need to talk to you." "I need this job" or "I need this raise"
			- ^^The only things we [[need]] are the basics of physical survival and the basics of intellectual and emotional wellbeing.^^
	- Tough negotiators are experts at recognizing the neediness in their adversaries, and expert in creating it as well.
	- No talking
		- ^^Talking can be an overt showing of need. Talking and showing need go hand in hand. ^^
			- How many people do you know who won't let you get in a word edgewise? By being overbearing, these people are actually betraying neediness.
			- When emotions run hot and heavy in negotiations, the high-pitched voice is a sure sign of need. The rushed delivery is another sure sign. While needy negotiators raise their voices, negotiators under control lower their voices. So lower your voice in times of inner turmoil. Slow down.
	- Don't worry about [[rejection]]
		- Fear of rejection is a sign of neediness-specifically, the need to be liked. It is imperative for the negotiator to understand what rejection is, and who can reject you, and who cannot. The key point is that your adversaries in a negotiation cannot reject you. There's nothing you truly need from them. Never allow them to believe that they have the power to do so.
		- Don't fake emotional energy in the effort to be liked, to be smart, to be important. Be recognized as being effective and businesslike.
	- Wanting is fine, needing is not
		- Express and change need, to want.
- Chapter 2 - The Columbo Effect - The secret of Being "Not Okay"
	- Let your negotiation partner be a little more okay, you start to bring down barriers. By allowing them to feel in control, you are actually in control.
	- It's okay to be less than perfect. People necessarily don't want to be around perfect people. People want to with a regular person. Struggle a little, borrow a pen or paper to take notes. Search for the right words to ask questions. Let people help you is an excellent way to help them more okay.
	- The tougher the negotiation, the more critical it is that if someone has to be "unokay," it is you and not your partner. When your negotiation partner feels unokay, the barriers go up much faster than you can break them down, but unokayness on your part can break down barriers.
- Chapter 3 - Start With No - How decisions move negotiations forward
	- ^^In negotiations, decisions are 100 percent emotional. Facts come later. ^^
	  id:: 2fe42a5c-1b5a-4691-8eac-de55229ef13a
		- Our emotions rage all over the scale before we make a decision, and the we set about rationalizing it.
	- ^^You want to illicit a "no" from your negotiation partner, rather than a "yes" or "maybe"^^
		- The key idea is that "no" gets you past emotional issues and trivial issues to essential issues. We want decision-based negotiation, not the emotion-based waste of time known as win-win.
			- You can offer your negotiation partner to say no from the start.
	- Never "Save the adversary" or "Save the relationship"
		- ^^There can be no saving of the adversary (negotiation partner) emotionally, intellectually, financially, or on any level. It's a terrible practice that does neither side any good.^^
			- If you do save the adversary, you are partially responsible for their decision.
		- ^^Respect, not friendship, is what you want^^
	- The fear of hurting people's feelings, of not being liked, of damaging long-term relationship--these are all reason we're afraid to say "no". Another  is that we're afraid to make a wrong decision.
		- When we make a bad decision, we simply make a better decision as a follow-up.
		- Take responsibility for the bad decision, learn from it, embrace the failure, and soldier on without fear because you are only one decision away from getting back on track. But this attitude and approach takes discipline and  a lot of self-confidence, because being right is very important to most of us. It is a powerful need, and like all needs, it must be overcome.
- Chapter 4 - Success comes from the foundation of a mission and purpose
	- ^^Effective negotiation is effective decision making and the foundation of effective decision making is a valid [[mission]] and [[purpose]] to guide it. ^^
	- If you're not working on behalf of your own mission and purpose, you're working on behalf of someone else's. It's fine to work on behalf of someone else if you understand what you are doing--if you freely embrace and take their mission and purpose as your own to support theirs--but it is a terrible waste to work on behalf of someone else's mission and purpose without realizing it.
	- People who are unhappy and frustrated in their work either have invalid mission and purpose or they don't have one and are serving's someone else's.
	- Money and Power are not valid mission or purpose
		- They are self-centered.
	- Your mission and purpose is set in your adversary's world
		- example: if you are a business, then set your mission and purpose in your customer's world. Setting the mission and purpose in the customer's or adversary's world allows them to see clearly the features and benefits that you and your product or service have to offer them.
			- Your mission and purpose is to focus on someone else.
		- Often we want to create a vision in the other party that will move them to take action. Mission and purpose drives vision for all parities, and vision drives effective decision making for all parties.
		- Your business is never apparent. It requires in-depth questioning that gives you a process that provides you constant refocusing on what you do. **You must constantly analyze and reassess.**
- Chapter 5 - Stop trying to control the outcome: focus on your behavior and actions instead
	- Focus your attention on behavior rather than setting results that you have no control over. We can create [[automatic behaviors]] through awareness and design of our behavior
	- Control what you can control, forget the rest
		- **When we have results as our goal, we tend to work harder not smarter.** We end up working on the wrong problem or with the wrong activities and habits and dig a deeper hole.
			- ^^at all times set goals and objectives that furthers your missions and purpose^^
- 6. What do you say? Asking questions
	- The most important behavioral goal and habit you can develop, is your ability to ask questions.
	- Asking questions helps us build the adversary's vision by answering our questions (negotiation partner)
	- ^^When asking questions don't frame questions with verbs^^ (e.g., Is there any reason you wouldn't say yes to this, or can you say yes to this?, Is this what you really want?)
		- ^^Ask questions that are [[open-ended]], ask "What would you like (me) to do?" ^^
			- Begin with interrogatives, maybe except why, How, what, who, where, which
- Chapter 7 - How do you say it?
	- In a negotiation, [[nurturing]] will keep the negotiation going through thick and thin. Your ability to nurture will be the key to bringing the negotiation back to the table after a breakdown. Your ability to nurture your adversary, to put him or her at ease, is the key to assuring her that you are listening and that you value what she has to say. Nurturing is also just another way to allow your a dversary to feel okay.
	- [[Nurturing]] should be part of your body language. When you're seated, refrain from a sudden forward movement. Lean back. Relax your neck, face, and hands. If you're standing, lean against the wall, lower your posture. No one is going to deal effectively with you if you're towering over them.
		- But a lot of average negotiators give out the wrong signals in less obvious ways. They lean forward and jerk their arms and smack the table. The truly comfortable, trained negotiator takes it easy. When in doubt, slow your cadence of speech, lower your voice. As the old saying goes, laughter often is the best medicine, especially laughter directed at ourselves.
		- [[Laughter]] is a way to nurture everyone in the roomâ€”including ourselves. Now, none of this is contrarian at all. Granted, you won't find a section about nurturing in most negotiation books, but that's just because those authors are trying to impress you with their arcane academic theories and charts and graphs. They wouldn't disagree with me on this point; they just incorrectly believe it's not hotshot material.
		- ^^Even more important than what you say is how you say it for nurturing purposes.^^
	- ^^[[Reversing]] is answering a question with a question. This behavior is a necessary skill for successful negotiations.^^
		- The reverse should be preceded by a short [[nurturing]] statement.
		- Examples: "Jim, what will this option do for me?"
		  "That's a good question, Dick. Before we get into that, what's the biggest challenge you're facing in this area?"
		  
		  Nurture, reverse:
		  "That was certainly well thought out. By the way, what are your cost constraints?"
		  
		  "We definitely have to talk about that, but before we go there ..."
		  
		  "Interesting. Really interesting. How soon will you be up against a deadline here?"
		  
		  "That's something I hadn't thought of. When could you deliver?"
		  
		  "Hmmm. What am I missing here? What else can you tell me about that?"
		- The reverse assures that you're dealing with an important question for you, thereby allowing you to gather more insight and information.
	- ^^Never answer an unasked question^^
	- ^^Don't interpret a  statement as a question ^^
	- ^^Never reply to random statement^^
		- ^^Use connectors such as "and" "which means" or silence to accomplish the above^^
	- ^^When negotiating stay in the neutral range^^
		- [[strip lines]] brings either too negative or too positive into a neutral range
			- negative strip lines points out the negatives for awareness. "I agree with you the phone service is terrible, I would switch too. But let me upgrade your plan and allow us another opportunity for a coverage check."
			- positive strip lines point out a negative from a positive position. "While black is a powerful color on a car, it does show up dirt."
- Chapter 8 - Quiet Your Mind, Create a Blank Slate
	- Blank slating is sitting ready and waiting to receive any information, new attitudes, new emotions, or new anything that our negotiation partner wittingly or unwittingly communicates our way. It is through blank slating that we learn the underlying motives of the discussion and what our partner really needs.
		- For blank slating to work we can't be needy, nor fearful of failing or hearing no.
		- We have to give up expectations and assumptions for blank slates to work.
			- Positive expectations can be used to manipulate us by others. They can build us up, then change the terms on us last minute but expecting the same conditions that were originally asked for in the positive building phase of the discussion. For example, a company may ask for a discount on a larger order, we are happy, then last-minute change the order number lower and still want to keep the original large order price.
			- Negative expectations can also be harmful as they can cause us to assume and predict the future incorrectly and stop pursuing our goals. If we have previous negative experiences in the past with a particular client, we may cut our losses and stop negotiating too early before determining why the negotiations are resulting in poor results.
			- Positive and negative expectations should not have any place in negotiations. You blank slate and negotiate, that is all. Expectations injects emotions into the negotiation which may complicate the process.  Instead of expectations, build and establish predetermined goals and objectives, create automatic triggers and prepare ahead of time.
			- You cannot banish emotions fully in negotiations. When a negotiation is going well and you are tempted to get excited to let your emotions take over, call a time out, take a bathroom break or suggest getting a coffee or cup of water to drink.
		- Assume nothing
			- Assumptions are another enemy of good negotiations like emotions (positive or negative expectations)
				- Assumptions lead us to act and design solutions to a possibility that may not be a reality.
				- Don't limit your opportunities by taking statements at face value and assuming the definition or interpretation is correct. Ask clarifying questions. If someone is too busy to do something. Ask if they have time elsewhere or what can they do for the time they have. What do they think that they have to do within the allotted time.
				- We can plat assumptions for others. Our assumptions always works against us, other people's assumptions may work for us.
			- Do you research
				- One way to reduce assumptions and expectation traps is to do your research before the negotiation. The more we know about the topic of discussion and the issues surrounding it the more prepared we are to counter false assumptions and incorrect expectations.
	- Take notes to blank slate and reduce your emotions. Note-taking reinforces our listening skills and removes us from our inner thoughts and places us in our conversation's partner world. It is important to note what is really said and what we actually hear during negotiation than what we allow ourselves to think while others talk. To blank slate correctly, the inner voice in our head should be quieter.
	- To listen well we have to listen to all the words, without thinking or interrupting, and without answering our own questions. As we take notes our emotions are more controlled--we don't show excitement or disappointment.
		- Taking notes also makes our conversation feel more at ease and makes them more comfortable to share information with us. This lets us talk less, which is good because our conversation partner should be talking more. When we spare our words, we are more focused with our questions.
		- Less speaking time during the negotiation also limits any regrettable slips of information.
	- If you can't blank slate, cancel the meeting, or else end up spilling the beans. Constantly update the status of the negotiation.
	- Play the mind game
		- Envision the negotiation process. The greater our ability to envision, the greater the potential for success. If you can't see it, you'll never be able to do it. Envision the negotiation and you are performing well, listening well, a blank slate, and asking the right questions. Picture yourself in perfect behavior. See yourself relaxed with no expectations, no need, and no fear.
- 9. Know their "Pain", Paint their pain: Work with your adversary's real problem
	- In any negotiation you must have vision before you can take action. No vision, no action. No vision, no decision. But what do we need  a vision of?
		- Pain. Pain is what brings every  negotiation partner to the table.
		- Adhering to your mission and purpose will keep you from going seriously astray in a negative direction. And your vision of your negotiation partner's pain will orient you in the right direction So listen well and do your research.  All meaningful decisions and actions are defined by a vision.
			- You must never enter a negotiation unless you have seen your' partner's pain. We can only fulfill and succeed in our mission if we can communicate the benefits and features of our solutions will address their pain.
	- [[Nurturing]] can reveal the hidden pains of our negotiation partners. If your partner is acting strangely, uncover the motivations or pain causing the behavior and nurture the pain away.
		- Without careful nurturing, the vision your partners have will have is that they're incompetent losers and that their heads will soon be rolling. We must carefully nurture with a careful painting of their pain so they can see and accept the benefits and merits of the correct vision you are giving them. Only then can you influence them to your side of the decision.
			- Don't be flagrant and describe your vision. Instead, ask a series of interrogative-led questions to build their vision. An example question would be, "What direction is this whole industry now going in the area of wireless widgets?"
	- When we start feeling  lost in the negotiation we can return to center through our mission and purpose. And your mission and purpose resides in your adversary's world, in their pain. And always nurture their pain so they aren't overwhelmed.
		- The clearer your adversary's pain, the easier the decision-making process will be. So we have to make sure we are painting a clear picture of their "pain" or make them aware of it. (sometimes they don't even know).
			- You can't tell people about their pain, they will have to see it for their own. The better you can describe the situation the better they can acknowledge it.
- 10. The Real Budget and How to Build It: The importance of time, energy, money and emotion
	- The overall budget is a comprehensive tool, a means to retain control of the negotiation by making certain our investments are working for us, not against us.  You can use the formula time =x, energy = 2x, money 3x and emotion 4x. So for example, if we are putting in time and energy to negotiate the value of negotiation cost is 1x X 2x = 2x
	- Be aware that time can be used against you. Never chase time to create undue time pressures and deadlines for yourself. Don't waste your time going to meetings without a clear picture of the negotiation coming up--a clear picture of the adversary's pain, and firm knowledge that they have the budgets in time and energy, money and emotion to pay to have this pain taken away.
	- Cultivate patience by sticking to your missions and goals. Patience can help defend us when people try to run out the time on us. By definition, our mission and purpose is a long-term aim, a continuing task and responsibility. Budgeting our time is a matter of disciplining ourselves, of maintaining patience, of following our mission and purpose with dedication and skill.
	- Emotional energy is time. Keep our needs in check and completing the activity and behavioral goals we set will help us conserve our own energy and waste our conversation partners. **Don't waste energy by asking questions that don't move the negotiation. **Don't assume. Don't need something.
	- Save your time through preparation and research.
- 11. The Shell Game: Be Sure to Know the Real Deal Makers
	- Who are the real decision-makers within the adversary's bureaucracy? We can't create a clear vision and effectively paint the pain we are trying to get rid of without knowing who the decision-maker is. We need to understand not only who decides within the partner's organization but also their decision-making process.
		- We risk wasting our time and energy appealing to the wrong people or negotiating incorrectly if we don't understand their processes with making decisions.  Sometimes the negotiation partner doesn't know their own business processes in decision-making and we have to help them figure it out. After finding who the decision-maker(s) are consider the people who may influence their decision.
		- Work with the blockers who are getting in the way from you reaching the decision-maker. They are blocking because they've been told to block or feel some esteem in blocking. Blocking makes them feel okay. We can start from the top and get booted down to the blockers, thus getting the stamp of approval to talk to them or work ourselves from the bottom, working with the blockers and nurturing their need to feel "okay."
- 12. Have an Agenda and Work It: Ride the Chaos Inherent in Negotiation
	- In all fields, the most successful people deal with the most difficult problems directly. We have to be able to identify our problems and bring them to the negotiation table directly by way of an agenda to become effective negotiators. Agendas help us maintain emotional control and a means to stay on track. Our agendas must provide a clear path through the negotiation ticket.
	- Every negotiation session requires an agenda--even a telephone call or e-mail, no matter how short, even a minute or one paragraph--needs an agenda. The agenda makes clear what our purpose is.
		- Make sure your agenda has been negotiated or it won't work.
		- Agendas can contain:
			- problems (imagined, real, or predicted)
				- A problem real, imagined, or predicted to come about can be part of the agenda. Problems should be visible so we can work at solving them.
					- __Example problems:__
						- We don't understand Mr. Smith's vision of his business.
						- Our company doesn't know where the adversary is going with its new program, and therefore our preparation is impaired.
			- baggage (ours and theirs)
				- Baggage is the collected life experiences and observations that we carry all the time. Baggage is an assumption, an educated guess based on our past experiences
					- Your negotiation partner will not resent you for asking baggage type of questions. They will respect you for asking. We should be warier of baggage that is left unrecognized or negotiated in the beginning.
					- __example: __
						- "George, I'm new in this business. If my inexperience is going to be a problem in this deal, let's talk about it now."
				- Agendas lay out everything that may significantly affect reaching a deal, that includes baggage.
			- what we want
				- Know what you want at each step of the negotiation and place it on the agenda. Most often we are thinking about the ends and outcomes, which are out of our control, not about the means, which we control with agendas.
				- Structure your wants as a decision from your negotiation partner. __example__: We want to know whether you do or do not see our company as committed to your success.
			- what happens next
				- Negotiate the next steps and verify.
- 13. Present Your Case--If You Insist: Beware the seduction of PowerPoint
	- The greatest presentation you will ever give is the one your negotiation partner never sees. The classic presentation serves only to create objections, so you end up answering questions rather than asking them.  Remember we don't tell anyone anything, they have to see it for themselves. Presentations place people in intellectual mode. ((2fe42a5c-1b5a-4691-8eac-de55229ef13a))
		- Can we present to trigger the emotional mode? Can we present to elicit questions?
		- Presentations are useless if we don't understand conversation partner's needs and wants.
		- If we have to present, present only information that addresses the concern of your adversary or their pain. Resist to include everything. Present in the order of importance.
		- At the end of each meeting create a bridge for the next action step. Don't go end without a next action step.
- 14. Life's Greatest Lesson: The Only Assurance of Long-Term Success
	- Work on your self-esteem to create success during negotiations. It is our self-esteem that allows us to provide space for our adversary to be "OK". Self-esteem allows us to fight when we face overwhelming odds and face the pressures of success. It demands that we know our worth and paid accordingly. Low self-esteem is a success killer.
	- > Achievement requires self-esteem, and to build self-esteem you only need to start paying forward at every opportunity with your family and friends, in the workplace, in your community. And then you should pay forward some more. You will reap the benefit in every aspect of your life, including most definitely the negotiating table...paying forward is the secret to creating self-esteem.
