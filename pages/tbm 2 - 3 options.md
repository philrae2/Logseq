	- When assessing the quality of a decision ask if there were other options considered and why they were rejected.
		- Explaining rejected options provides important context and conveys rigor and decision making integrity. The criteria and thought process becomes more understandable.
		- Only having one option lacks context and a reference to judge the quality of that option.
		- Without other options, you can't really say a decision took place.
		- Consider documenting:
			- What options did you consider but ultimately reject? Why? What might change that would inspire the team to reconsider those options? Walk through your assumptions. Describe your confidence levels. When will you revisit the current selected option?
	- We define problems and opportunities to inspire creative problem solving and aligned autonomy.
