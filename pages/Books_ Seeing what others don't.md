	  2. The flash of illumination
		- Four stages of insight according to Wallas in the Art of Thought:
		  collapsed:: true
			- preparation
				- The stage we investigate, analyze a problem. This stage is intentional, systematic, and effortful, though eventually fruitless
				- This stage may not be necessary if you have a prepared mind, meaning you have the prerequisite experience and skills necessary to identify an insight, and not necessary deliberately work on a problem.  **Deliberate and specific preparation doesn't guarantee success.**
			- incubation
				- We stop consciously thinking about the problem and let our unconscious mind take over.
				- Happy ideas come unexpectedly without effort, like an inspiration...effort and intention drive inspiration away. They come more readily during the slow ascent of wooded hills on a sunny day.
					- Treat the incubation period seriously. We should seek mental relaxation and stop thinking about the problem. Avoid anything that interferes with the unconscious mind working on the problem.
				- Gary Klein disagrees with this step as well, seeing it as unnecessary to gaining insight. Especially in sudden insights to problems you weren't trying to solve.
			- illumination
				- when insights bursts forth with conciseness, suddenness, and immediate certainty
			- verification
				- The stage where we test if an idea is valid
		- Characteristics of insight
		  collapsed:: true
			- Insights transform how we see
			- Insights transform how we feel
			- Insights change our desires; the new stories shift our goals, leading us to give up some ambitions and pursue others.
		- Most firefighters and others who make rapid decisions in stressful and pressure filled environments use recognition-primed decision strategy—meaning they used past experiences to help see patterns and a quick mental run through of possible decisions. 
		  collapsed:: true
			- This decision making is called naturalistic decision making, compared to lab-based decision making studies.
		- Intuition vs insight - intuition is applying the patterns you already know from experience to decision making while insight is the discovery of new patterns.
		- Stories are a way we frame and organize the details of a situation. There are other types of frames besides stories, such as maps and even organizational wiring diagrams that show where people stand in hierarchy.
	- collapsed:: true
	  3. Connections
		- We can take new information from other fields and problems, and retrofit them to apply to the problems we are solving.
			- If we expose ourselves to many different ideas that may help form new connections we can increase our insights.
				- Though connecting dots seems easy, there are noise that may disconnect ideas and insights from connecting. These noise maybe information that prevents us from updating our old stories to better ones.
	- collapsed:: true
	  4. Coincidences and Curiosities
		- People who can pick up on trends, spot patterns, wonder about irregularities, and notice coincidences are important resources. They maybe wrong so don't trust them blindly, but they should be listened to.
			- Coincidences provide us feedback to search for alternatives and options that may lead us to create and make insights.
				- Coincidences change our understanding, change what we notice, change what excites us, and set us on the path to making a discovery
		- Curiosities provoke people to investigate further, the initial question of "What's going on here?" may not contain the insight but it starts the person on the road to gaining insight. Curiosities differ from coincidences in that they are sparked through one event rather than a series of similar events or patterns.
		- Coincidences can be dangerous if the associations lead us to nowhere. Therefore, we should make sure to test coincidences and not to put much faith in them unless validated.
		- Also, consider your methods if they are affecting the outcome of your tests. For example, in the discovery of H. Pylori and ulcers, the swabs were being thrown out too early instead of letting the cultures have proper time to grow. The cultures were thrown out after two days (due to following methods for strep) instead of growing them for five days (for H. Pylori).
		- 5. Contradictions
	- collapsed:: true
	  5. Contradictions
		- Contradiction insights send us on the road to a better story. They signal that there's something seriously wrong with the story we're currently telling ourselves.
			- Contradictions make us doubt our current story.
		- A suspicious mind or skeptical mind-set can lead to discovery, we need to be open-minded enough to be curious and skeptical of the new information we come across.
			- Noticing contradictions shifts the way we understand things.
		- Einstein conducted thought experiments to test expose his thinking.
	- collapsed:: true
	  6. Creative Desperation
		- Use rewards vs punishment for [influencing]([[influence]])
		- Creative desperation is more conscious and deliberate than spotting connections, coincidences, curiosities, and contradictions. People aren't accidentally stumbling onto insights. They are actively searching for them.
	- collapsed:: true
	  7. Different Ways to Look at Insight
		- Insights can be gradual, rather a quick burst of a solution
	- collapsed:: true
	  8. The Logic of Discovery
		- The contradiction path to insight seems to go as follows: we encounter an anomaly, we resist temptation to discard it, we give it credence and imagine that it is valid, and then we revise the rest of our beliefs to make it all fit. Sometimes we have to give up our old core beliefs to accommodate true contradictions.
		- The desperation path to insight discovery is to actively look for an assumption that we can reverse or eliminate. Through the elimination of an assumption we can improve the situation.
		- The connection path to insights notices coincidences or curiosities we add a new anchor to our beliefs.

		- A person may use multiple paths to reach the outcome.

		- We blame ourselves for failing to make connections between ideas and information, even when it is readily available and visible to us.

	  10. The study of Contrasting Twins - why one person gets it while another doesn't
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2F6wCZXgfUd8.png?alt=media&token=c1330939-8a88-4b14-a03c-58fbe8e40c90)
		- __Flawed beliefs__ - One reason we may miss insights is that we are holding tightly to false beliefs. The correct path to insight is to hypothesize and test beliefs.
			- People gripped with flawed beliefs and theories can ignore, explain away, or distort evidence that could lead to insights. However we don't want people to fixate on data either without validating it. Sometimes data can be false or misleading due to the preceding steps in the system creating the data.
		- __Lack of Experience__ - Gaining and having experiences of various fields provides us the ability to see insights, to make connections/implications between ideas and thought, that wo uld be invisible without the necessary experience.
			- However, having the necessary experience isn't enough to see the implications or connect between ideas; we need to correctly tune our experience to inform our attention. Our backgrounds can sensitize us to cues or patterns that others might miss. People with prepared minds are more receptive to noticing insights and engaging with them.
				- We may see these insights, coincidences, contradictions and curiosities but because they are difficult or uncomfortable, choose instead an easier path that may lead us away to creating insights. #[[automatic behaviors]]
				- Our flawed beliefs may overcome our experience and makes us blind and disrupts the fine tuning of our experience to allow us to see these insights
		- __A Passive Stance__ Some insights to form require active searching to be noticed, but we are remaining passive.
		- __A  concrete reasoning style__ may hinder our minds to opening them for tangents and other paths to insight. A playful reasoning style on the other hand likes to juggle ideas and imagine hypothetical scenarios.
		- Be [open-minded]([[open-mindedness]]) about new information and ready to change your existing viewpoints. Don't hold on too tightly to one idea or framework. Use [[mental  model]]s from other fields
		- When solving problems try to anticipate where the problem may go and create plans for readiness to engage in those future moments of advantage
		- The [[system]] we design to help people do their current  job may lock them into the original job concept and reduce the chance for insights. Be careful in doing too much automation that maybe harmful for insight generation. **Some bad system design guidelines are**:
			- The system clearly display critical cues in advance can cause us to miss relevant cues that became relevant after the system design.
			- The system should filter out irrelevant data is similarly destructive for insight generation. It can mistakenly screen out serendipitous data and unexpected cues that often spark insights.
			- The system should help people monitor progress towards their goals.
		- Stronger design equals weaker insights
			- Insights can come about from disorder whereas a well designed and orderly environment may hamper insights, unless the system was also designed to allow insights to happen.
				- A system design would need to promote decision makers room to discover insights by giving them more freedom to shift goals and plans without getting disoriented. System designers need to pay less attention to how work was done in the past and create an environment of options.

	  11. How Organizations Obstruct Insights
		- Organizations stifle insights because they value predictability, they recoil from surprises, and they crave perfection and the absence of errors. In the organization's goal for reduction of uncertainty and minimize errors.
		- Managers and leadership associate creativity with uncertainty and failures, that will mess up their timelines, contracts, and plans for projects.
		- > Insights can take us beyond perfection. They can show us ways to improve on the original plan but, in an organization, there's little payoff for going beyond perfection and lots of downside if you fail to deliver.
			- The actions we take to reduce errors and uncertainty can get in the way of insights. Organizations care more about error reduction and certainty than discovering insights. They fall into the predictability and perfection trap.
				- **Error reduction methods hinder insights in the following ways:**
					- __They make us reluctant to speculate__ The pressure to avoid errors can make us distrust any intuitions or insights we cannot validate
					- __They put insights in a negative light__ Organizations like to reach closure on decisions and get irritated when asked to revisit them. They close down debate and speculation as soon as possible.
					- __They encourage us to repress anomalies__
					- __They make us passive__ When we turn off our brains and trust our checklists, processes, and procedures when learn to default to avoiding critical thinking and losing a skeptical mind. When we don't think, we are not open-minded for insights.
						- Checklists are beneficial for simple and predictable tasks, not for standardizing novel and complex problems.
						- If you disagree with what leadership thinks say so. When we defer to leadership, the assumption is that we think their processes and decision making is correct. Defer if you agree they are correct or the benefit of fighting isn't worth the trouble.

	  13. How Not to Hunt for Insights
		- **Activities that limit insight**
			- Insights pop up unexpectedly, so we’d schedule a specific date, a specific starting and stopping time, for capturing an insight.
			- Insights flow from people’s own interests, so we would assign an insight task to the subjects we were studying rather than using problems they were already thinking about.
			- Insights spring from the themes that matter to us, the themes that keep churning in our minds even when we’re not attending to them, so we’d make sure to use a meaningless task that people don’t care about.
			- Many insights grow over long periods of time, so we’d keep the available time short, no more than an hour.
			- Teresa Amabile, a creativity researcher at the Harvard Business School, found that evaluation pressure interferes with insight, so we would make sure people knew we were timing them and appraising their ability.
			- A number of investigators, starting with Graham Wallas, have reported that making people verbalize their thought processes can interfere with insight, so we might ask for “think-aloud” reports throughout the session.
			- Many insights emerge from connections, coincidences, curiosities, and contradictions, so we would use only tasks that created an impasse and ignore other paths.
			- In two-thirds of the cases in my research, people used their experience to make connections and see contradictions, so we’d study the way people handle a task they’ve never seen before.
			- If we wanted to get even more diabolical, we would use methods that make a person’s experience actually interfere with insights.
- PART 3 - Opening the Gates: How can we foster insights
  collapsed:: true
	- 14. Helping Ourselves
		- Use confusions, contradictions, and conflicts as springboards to insights.
		- The more information we have exposed ourselves the greater the chances that those distinct information will make fortuitous linkages.
		- In __Where Good Ideas Come From__, Steven Johnson, recommends increasing the density of our ideas and our contact with creative people. We should foster serendipity--the random collision of ideas. We should increase our intersections with different communities, using real and virtual gathering places such as coffeehouses and social networks. ^^We should encourage group and network collaboration as opposed to individual efforts.^^
		- Use critical thinking to ferret out false assumptions. Don't over use critical thinking to stifle out innovation and insights.
	- 15. Helping Others
		- Just because we have a good insight doesn't mean we'll behave with more maturity or make wiser choices. We need to transform these insights into action.
		- Teaching depends on what other people think, not what you think.
			- This kind of teaching is very hard. It takes more than knowing the right answers. It takes curiosity and compassion and the ability to decenter--to take someone else's perspective. It depends on skill at using contradictions to help people make discoveries.
	- 16. Helping Our Organizations
		- If we want to help our organizations increase insights, we must first diagnose what is going on.
		- Organizations are preventing insights by imposing too many controls and procedures in order to reduce or eliminate errors.
			- Decrease the motivations from leadership to seek out certainty and error reduction and increase the incentives for insight and innovation. However, realistically, this approach will be met with resistance and can damage your reputation
				- Instead, increase the processes and procedures to increase innovation, invention, and insight discovery.
					- Create feedback loops to gather undocumented insights and innovative ideas from your workers.  example: gathering example stories of insights from your workers to implement.
						- the emotional content of the story resulted in action, emotion helps translate insights into lasting organizational change.
				- We can also redesign the error reduction and procedures for perfection to stifle less innovation and insight discovery.
				- [[Six Sigma]] is an example of extreme focus on error reduction, where it kills insights and innovation. While companies who employ Six Sigma saw great increases in production, the companies future was threatened from the lack of innovation.
		- Sometimes, it's not that organization lacks the insight to pursue innovation, but rather the courage and motivation to act on the insights they have. The organization lacks the willpower to make changes.
			- Examples of companies who lacked the courage to enact the innovations and insights they had were Kodak who invented the first digital camera and Encyclopedia Brittanica who had the first CD encyclopedia. Though eventually, these companies would have failed to compete in the digital information age
			- An example of company who was brave enough to itself was IBM, shedding its PC business to transform into an information service company and
		- Organizational change should be motivated by insight and not forced. An organization that rigidly adheres to a doctrine of continual transformation, following the creative desperation path, is different from one that is sensitive to connections, coincidences, curiosities, and contradictions.
			- An organization demonstrates willpower when they act on insights, primarily when its about their goals and specifically when its about changing the goal itself.
		- **Appeal to authority**
			- We can try to get leaders of the organization to change the culture.
	- 17. Tips for Becoming an Insight Hunter
		- > There's more to probing than appreciative listening. Many incidents about insights into other people and why they behaved as they did. When trying to understand why people acted in a certain way, be __aware of their knowledge, beliefs, and experiences, motivation and competing priorities, and their constraints__
	- The Magic of Insights.
		- Our experiences can build confidence that may erode our ability to see insights. We tend to arrive at more accurate beliefs and more powerful patterns and stories about how things work. If we encounter the occasional glitch, we're usually able to explain it away and hold on to our ideas. ^^The more successful our beliefs, the harder it is to give them up. This process can lead to more rigid thinking.^^
