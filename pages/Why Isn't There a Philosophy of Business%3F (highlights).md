	- Venture money, in business, lets you scale your business, to pivot and create such that you make something people want. Grant money, in science, lets you experiment on your hypotheses, to pivot and create such that you can make something people want.
	  
	  For both the idea isn‚Äôt to have a complete thing, but to get to the next stage where you get more funding, once the initial idea is shown to have promise.
	  
	  For both, there is payoff. For venture capital, the payoff is capital. Eventually if it succeeds it makes enough money that the original investment is net positive. For grants, the payoff is social or cultural, to get known as the patron or the funder of something important, to accumulate social capital much as venture accumulates financial capital.
	  
	  The second is definitely less fungible and more speculative, since unlike money it isn‚Äôt a clear commodity you can accumulate or trade.
	  
	  But also, the types of hypotheses that are tested are different. Businesses do things to test ‚Äúdo my prospective customers want more of X‚Äù, and science often tests ‚Äúis X a correct explanation of this phenomenon‚Äù. It‚Äôs efficacy vs accuracy.
	  
	  The key question in science is, "is it true?" The key question of business is "will it work?"
	  
	  If science is the work of identifying new niches in the knowledge landscape, business is the work of expanding into and populating that landscape ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk0p6kzsz89dt6h8fn735ffd))
	- The scientific focus leads you to efforts to try and understand, pin down, things you want to know and things you think you know. A lot of the time the focus is on diving deeper into ever\-narrower straits, to try and make sure the hypotheses you have aren't false. Whether its Popperian falsification or just elimination of alternatives, science focuses on what qualifies as true.
	  
	  This is also why you can have a singular inventor in science, but business by definition is a team endeavour, because scale *is* success.
	  
	  The business focus leads you to try and see how things can be done. It's not particularly concerned with accuracy per se, as much as efficacy. Ideally the things you do would work in the real world because they're right, but neither your hypothesis nor your approach need be correct for the result to be correct. In other words, you can be wrong about your idea, your approach and your beliefs, and you can still be successful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk0pat3ab6czy48358wh9nzy))

	- I find it interesting that the more practical the consideration, the less its scrutinised or theorised. We use rules of thumb and heuristics and vague notions of what makes sense and trial\-and\-error to somehow muddle through. And while there are a thousand articles about how to build a software business, almost all of them are pretty useless when you try and apply them, because they‚Äôre usually idiosyncratic and uncopyable. They are, at best, ladders you throw away after using, like cliches whose meanings you came to understand only *after* you experienced the thing it refers to.
