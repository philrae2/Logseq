	- Companies that don‚Äôt let old models and past successes define who they are retain the potential to remain leaders and define the next era, and they are able to transition and grow through these turbulent times. Fostering and maintaining that potential requires world-class mental agility. So instead of resting on the momentum of its existing businesses, which are still growing, and trying to drive to improved profitability, Amazon is investing today in initiatives that might not pay back for years, if ever. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5w65114tk343jjdpxx9jvh))
	- Here‚Äôs how it happened. During the holiday season of 2003, we had challenges with website reliability during the busiest and most crucial time of the year. No bueno. Immediately after we wobbled through that holiday season, a task force was formed to address website scaling and reliability. This team decided to centralize computing infrastructure management. We were going to serve internal customers. Internal customers, it was discovered, are not demanding customers‚Äîonly external customers are truly demanding customers. Hence, the edict to invert the infrastructure and offer it to external developers. We learned in a hurry that developers loved the on-demand capabilities. Just like that, the strategy of AWS was developed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5wb2hjjzr3jb1085k4dapt))
		- **Note**: The creation of AWS.
	- Of course, to think like Amazon is not solely about innovation. All of this is supported by fanatical world-class operations. [Relentless.com](http://Relentless.com) was the name registered by Bezos for his startup venture, and the web address still goes to [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com). Relentless is Amazon‚Äôs attitude about operational excellence. Amazon is one of five companies that Gartner lists as ‚Äúmaster‚Äù in supply chain operations. Gartner has described Amazon as a ‚Äúbimodal‚Äù supply chain organization, unique in both its ability to operate at scale and innovate. In 2016, Amazon had 80 patents in supply chain technology alone![2](#introfn-2)
	  
	  The ability to both operate in a world-class manner and be a systematic innovator that is passionate about its customers‚Äîisn‚Äôt that what every CEO wants? This is why ‚Äúthinking like Amazon‚Äù is vital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5wd4ya9k3thd7jk75xj4kn))
	- idea 1: If you can strategize and evaluate your plans over a long period of time, you will be able to make investments and ‚Äúbets‚Äù that other businesses cannot. Identify the long-term risks and constraints in your business. You might be able to find strategic leverage by addressing them early. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5xag04m10wq5fdmg6whk7g))
	- Amazon‚Äôs second leadership principle is ‚ÄúOwnership,‚Äù by which leaders at Amazon strive to never sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. HQ2 was about long-term thinking and tackling a topic using an approach that derived many other benefits, instead of waiting until the potential leverage diminished to zero. Amazon‚Äôs leaders were not kicking the can down the road on this long-term business constraint. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5xkvc4w7tjmrkza55bh9pd))
	- If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you‚Äôre competing against a lot of people. But if you‚Äôre willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you‚Äôre now competing against a fraction of those people because very few companies are willing to do that. Just by lengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue. At Amazon we like things to work in five to seven years. We‚Äôre willing to plant seeds, let them grow‚Äîand we‚Äôre very stubborn ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5xn7cb70hxf8q45ema0mfr))
- New highlights added [[2023-09-20]] at 7:26 PM
	- Digging down, digital is about two things: speed and agility‚Äîexternally to your customers and market and internally within your organization. More specifically, it is about speed and agility wrapped in new business models, innovation, and the collection and use of an immense amount of data. *Speed* is a very precise repetitive motion. It‚Äôs about moving in one direction very efficiently, very precisely. Operational excellence at scale is the business equivalent to speed. *Agility*, on the other hand, is the attribute or skill to sense key facts, indicators, and market shifts and to quickly make changes and adjustments. Innovation in your business is driven by agility‚Äîthat is, the ability to make both big and small change happen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagjkvwebye7xsq8qnsyqjnc))
	- Amazon‚Äôs DNA is defined by these two traits: speed and agility. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagjsf9er7wdqnt2kcp79ccj))
		- **Note**: These two traits help Amazon become digital.
	- Becoming digital is about your business building these traits and competing differently. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagjt9jcbc8gxqdam0rnsret))
	- THE LONG VIEW
	  
	  Developing these traits in your own organization is not a single project. It will be difficult to develop a business case and to forecast results. Predictability will be hard to find. But you must believe in the transformational powers of data, technology, innovation, and the pursuit of perfection‚Äîapplied to all disciplines.
	  
	  To succeed, it is vital to take the long view. Constant knee-jerk reactions to the quarter-to-quarter mentality that drives most American business is not only inefficient. It‚Äôs also toxic to your culture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagjv91ymcvfeyyy1ym8z5zh))
	- idea 2: You will stick through the hard times if you are passionate about the cause and the customer. Consistent messaging regarding the mission will take the ‚Äúmildly interested‚Äù majority of employees in most organizations and make them fanatics for your business, for winning, and for the mission. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagjy2tgntj7s4e5n2ngy3ae))
	- it‚Äôs clear my intrinsic interest has been to improve business performance through three approaches: (1) efficiency, or creating processes that yield better quality with lower costs; (2) integration across disparate processes, data, systems, and ecosystems to create seamless capabilities; and (3) the development of new business models and capabilities allowing a business to compete differently. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagjyyy8vt478gxmc0tchcfd))
	- Ultimately, financial returns and sales are output metrics. As a leader, you don‚Äôt have direct control over them. They are the result of many other things you do. What you can control are the inputs. To win in digital, you must be deeply connected to your customers and users because that‚Äôs where the insights are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagkknhbk1hegqxvn44r33c5))
	- BUILDING A PATRIOT
	  
	  Jeff talks a lot about how mission-driven teams build better products. That‚Äôs great, but what does it mean to be mission driven?
	  
	  It‚Äôs said that wars are won by patriots, not mercenaries. We fight and care differently if we have a stake in the outcome of the war, if the commitment is cemented by something personal. And while it is great if the cement is mixed with a deep passion for the customer, a cement mixed with other ingredients can be just as strong and beneficial to the cause.
	  
	  Here‚Äôs the deal. Most employees don‚Äôt start off as patriots. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagkn059tazjr5j547st0b0r))
		- **Note**: Mercenaries are those people who are motivated by money.
	- I started by writing out this vision and understanding, holding several town hall meetings, and making the connection that ‚Äúmerchant obsession‚Äù was key to winning in this business. And, boy, did we need this business to work for us. The pressure was immense. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagnpp4mjb1mnhnqf968zwdx))
		- **Note**: Context: Growing Amazon third party. Customer obsession was already established but third-party sellers were treated as second-class citizens.
	- BEZOS‚ÄôS POINT OF VIEW
	  
	  Jeff talks about the need for a committed, customer-obsessed team. Quite frankly, it‚Äôs one of his greatest hits, and he plays it often:
	  
	  I strongly believe that missionaries make better products. They care more. For a missionary, it‚Äôs not just about the business. There has to be a business, and the business has to make sense, but that‚Äôs not why you do it. You do it because you have something meaningful that motivates you.[1](#ch2fn-1)
	  
	  Jeff‚Äôs point is clear and hard to debate. But it is also incomplete. It‚Äôs incomplete because it doesn‚Äôt explain that the business or team mission has to be aligned with every individual‚Äôs mission. Furthermore, if the opinion is that people can‚Äôt develop this mission if they don‚Äôt have it when entering a business, then hiring or transitioning a team gets tricky. Define the mission, figure out how it connects to passions, interests, and personal missions, and consistently integrate the mission in communications and meetings. You will be able to bring much more of the team along. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagnsxthh8gp6j12zhf19cf6))
	- Jeff, what does Day 2 look like? That‚Äôs a question I just got at our most recent all-hands meeting. I‚Äôve been reminding people that it‚Äôs Day 1 for a couple of decades. I work in an Amazon building named Day 1, and when I moved buildings, I took the name with me. I spend time thinking about this topic.
	  
	  Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1. To be sure, this kind of decline would happen in extreme slow motion. An established company might harvest Day 2 for decades, but the final result would still come.
	  
	  I‚Äôm interested in the question, how do you fend off Day 2? What are the techniques and tactics? How do you keep the vitality of Day 1, even inside a large organization? Such a question can‚Äôt have a simple answer. There will be many elements, multiple paths, and many traps. I don‚Äôt know the whole answer, but I may know bits of it. Here‚Äôs a starter pack of essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and high-velocity decision making.[1](#ch3fn-1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagqjtya0gt5tesjep7z86k2))
	- Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs interesting to me about Jeff‚Äôs starter pack of essentials‚Äîthey are all elements of culture. They define our priorities and how we work together. They are neither financial goals nor market goals. They are *fully* within the leaders‚Äô control, not the market‚Äôs or competitors‚Äô.
	  
	  While Jeff is focused on fending off Day 2, I‚Äôm interested in the questions, ‚ÄúWhat do you do if you are already a Day 2 company? How do you change course? Do you just accept your fate? If so, isn‚Äôt this a form of quitting? Or do you accept the risk and pain, and figure out how to move forward?‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagqkdrgjzmqebjr3xgwnygf))
	- Amazon‚Äôs Leadership Principle 11 is ‚ÄúEarn Trust,‚Äù which means being ‚Äúvocally self-critical even when doing so is awkward and embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team‚Äôs body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.‚Äù[2](#ch3fn-2) Start business or operations reviews with perspectives like ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how my team/business/operation sucked,‚Äù and then list the metrics and root causes. Discuss how you are going to fix them and what you need from others. If you start ‚Äúfeaturing the bad news,‚Äù the stigma goes away, but it takes bold leadership. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hags3xpyezct34z2tqegzpkq))
	- *Change the Questions You Are Asking*
	  
	  Ask questions that impose constraints (‚ÄúHow would we make our product/service/capability completely ‚Äòself-service‚Äô‚Äù?). Ask questions that create more customer empathy (‚ÄúWhat is our customer‚Äôs worst day?‚Äù). Ask questions that pose a different reality (‚ÄúHow would our product or service be completely ‚Äòsoftware defined‚Äô‚Äù?).
	  
	  Be purposeful and deliberate in fleshing out scenarios and potential answers to these questions. Use narratives (Idea 44) or future press releases (Idea 45). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagscp7ecpv29817ersqz2e0))
	- *Be on Target with Communication* Always
	  
	  To your team, to your investors, to your board, to your customers‚Äîeveryone in a leadership role needs to commit and be on point in their communications. Change does not happen with a memo or one meeting and declaration. Your priorities, your actions, and your communications need to always line up with your plan. Communications need to be both scheduled and planned, as well as spontaneous.
	  
	  Equip yourself and your leaders with message points to incorporate in everything you and they do. Repeat. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagsdayavxpn7rvk8kehhv4r))
	- idea 4: It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs job to know and have empathy and passion for the customer. Make sure everyone knows it‚Äôs their job. Find many ways to deliberately practice and build this expectation. Dive deep into the issues experienced by customers (or other key stakeholders), and don‚Äôt delegate figuring out the root causes. Know the details of the customer experience and what causes friction for customers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagsjkfx1cgs387pd3cte6d0))
	- What are the different methods of systematically creating and practicing customer obsession? Here‚Äôs a smattering of approaches:
	  
	  **1.**¬†¬†¬†**Use metrics that measure the customer experience.** We will talk more about metrics in Idea 31, but create metrics that measure *all* phases of the customer experience. Find a way to measure it rather than just surveying it. This will lead to innovation. Be creative in measuring as much of the customer experience as possible, even in nondigital experiences. You *can* measure the waiting time customers are experiencing in a real-time manner. Don‚Äôt use ‚ÄúWe are not a digital business or product‚Äù as an excuse. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajc14dtw9ad5k67g3zb0d19))
	- **2.**¬†¬†¬†**Create a voice of the customer program.** Create a voice of the customer program that not only highlights a customer issue but also assigns prioritized action items and work for any teams needed to fix the root cause. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajc1h1zhzm7jtebrhq5y9ef))
	- **3.**¬†¬†¬†**Everything starts with describing ‚Äúcustomer delight.‚Äù** In your narratives, your results, your shareholder letters, your plans, your strategies, your documentation, start with describing what delights your customer about this topic. If you can‚Äôt identify the customer impact, should you be spending time on it? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajc27dcm2fks7z08vhjq8ny))
	- **4.**¬†¬†¬†**Manage by walking around.** Spend considerable time as a customer, with your sales and service team, and interview the front line of your partners. Don‚Äôt rely too much on surveys because they don‚Äôt deliver many deep insights. Also, don‚Äôt rely solely on common proxies such as market reports or other summarized material‚Äîbecause they typically work only to confirm our opinion. Instead, you want to disconfirm your beliefs and opinions, and you want to understand the specific moments when you are disappointing a customer, gathering as many details of the situation as you can. *Management by walking around* (MBWA) is the practice of managers getting out of their ivory towers and spending time with customers and in the field so that they can gain better insight and empathy for what is really happening. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajc31mxasqqb2ef8zy5dw76))
	- THE RESULTS ARE NOT JUST CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
	  
	  By making customer obsession everyone‚Äôs job, you hope that customer satisfaction will improve. That would be great, but in baseball parlance, I consider this a ‚Äúsingle.‚Äù Customer obsession leads to operational excellence, which we will discuss more in Idea 22. However, the ‚Äúhome run,‚Äù nay the ‚Äúgrand slam,‚Äù of customer obsession is to build on customer satisfaction and operational excellence. The grand slam is innovation and business model evolution‚Äîbecoming inspired to develop and expand beyond your current products, services, and business model.
	  
	  Amazon‚Äôs sophisticated logistics expertise did not come from wanting to be a supply chain company. It came from understanding that the customer experience was greatly affected by flexibility, speed, and quality of delivery. Amazon Web Services (AWS) did not come from wanting to be a cloud technology company but from needing to provide a scalable infrastructure to provide a great online customer experience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajcj7g4rjzyn4qpdwnfb32w))
	- Amazon is known as a demanding place to work. It‚Äôs not for everyone. You could say the company is ‚Äúaggressive.‚Äù Aggressive for results‚Äîthat is, the right types of results. Aggressive for people to produce and have mastery of their domain. Aggressive for teams and leaders to achieve the impossible: perfection. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajckgf2m9qjz7tsdpwc4kt9))
	- Think about how most large companies operate. Big-company politics tend to rule the day. Discussions are not forthright. Meetings are layered in so much posturing and subtle deception, they are downright Shakespearean. Seniority and titles matter more than having the right data or insight. People speak out of both sides of their mouths. They smile and nod their heads yes without agreeing. In this world, civility is more important than being right. Results suffer for the sake of harmony. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajcnhh8mernbed0xy87gk3q))
	- idea 5: Make being right the most important thing. Set the tone from the top that we will win by doing the right thing, having honest conversations leading with customer obsession and data, seeking perfection through data, and ignoring job titles, while still treating each other with respect. Many of the ideas in this book will help reinforce this principle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajcnztahkh99ts3dey53gwr))
	- Of all Jeff‚Äôs management notions, perhaps the most distinctive is his belief that harmony is often overvalued in the workplace, that it can stifle honest critique and encourage polite praise for flawed ideas and execution. Instead, Amazonians are instructed to ‚ÄúDisagree and Commit‚Äù (Leadership Principle 13)‚Äîto vigorously debate colleagues‚Äô ideas with feedback that can be painfully blunt before lining up behind a decision.
	  
	  ‚ÄúWe always want to arrive at the right answer,‚Äù said Tony Galbato, Amazon‚Äôs vice president for human resources, in an e-mail statement. ‚ÄúIt would certainly be much easier and socially cohesive to just compromise and not debate, but that may lead to the wrong decision.‚Äù[1](#ch5fn-1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajcpq9zfej8646y9ytaetba))
	- Amazon has a name for the approach of getting at intellectual honesty and being self-critical. It‚Äôs called ‚Äútruth seeking,‚Äù the goal of which is to avoid consensus-based social cohesion where nobody has to be wrong and to get to the right answer or insight. Bezos‚Äôs belief is that if you are a truth-seeking company competing against a compromise company, you will win. Don‚Äôt fall into being a compromise company when it is possible to measure and define the truth. This is ‚Äúfeaturing the bad news.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajcqp8vfsy5avawy0rg88z9))
	- If getting along is more valued than being right, the business will become more about getting along than about doing the right thing over time. This value seeps in slowly, but definitively. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajwdbwfw3vbs5tsspf27tq9))
	- Bezos abhors what he calls ‚Äúsocial cohesion‚Äù‚Äîthat is, the natural impulse to seek consensus.[2](#ch5fn-2) He‚Äôd rather his employees battle it out with numerical swords and customer passion. He has codified this approach in one of Amazon‚Äôs 14 leadership principles, the company‚Äôs highly prized values that are inculcated into new hires and discussed throughout each employee‚Äôs life cycle in the organization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajwec7zc4bx34k1m7qezcyn))
	- Consensus poses two dangers for the business trying to be innovative. The first danger is that hard, honest, forthright conversations are not being had. The second danger is that ideas that are truly innovative tend to be counterintuitive, and they often seem stupid, impossible, counterproductive, or all three.
	  
	  WHAT TO DO?
	  
	  **1.**¬†¬†¬†**Test it through practice.** Try to catch moments when honest conversations are not taking place. Be purposeful in communicating that both parties demand rigorous thought and execution. And while both parties must be respectful of others, the business needs *both* demanding conversations and respect.
	  
	  **2.**¬†¬†¬†*Slow down* **certain conversations and meetings.** Debate the issue, and review the type of conversation you are having and the principles or approach you are taking in making decisions. This helps the team get better at understanding why we are making a decision in a certain manner.
	  
	  **3.**¬†¬†¬†**Use metrics and service-level agreements (SLAs).** Hold each other accountable with metrics, service-level agreements (SLAs), and deep root-cause conversations. Root-cause conversations often take considerable effort, and you must be disciplined to understand the multiple improvements that might be needed. Exercises like asking ‚Äúthe five whys‚Äù where you ask ‚ÄúWhy did this happen‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy did I allow this to affect my business‚Äù five times help to get past superficial answers and get to the real root cause. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajxfa5f19hs1vp4j283j2h5))
	- idea 6: Set the expectation that leaders cannot point the finger at others if they don‚Äôt achieve the right results. Demonstrate how to better manage dependencies so they can better deliver outstanding results in distributed organizations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajxps1a6527av44d033tsa9))
	- Willink‚Äôs book reminds me of an Adam Lashinsky story regarding Steve Jobs and Apple‚Äôs vice presidents and janitors, which I will paraphrase here.
	  
	  According to Lashinksy, Steve Jobs told employees a short story when they were promoted to vice president at Apple. Jobs would tell the VP that if the garbage in his office was not being emptied, Jobs would naturally demand an explanation from the janitor. ‚ÄúWell, the lock on the door was changed,‚Äù the janitor could reasonably respond. ‚ÄúAnd I couldn‚Äôt get a key.‚Äù It‚Äôs an irritation for Jobs, but the janitor‚Äôs response is reasonable. It‚Äôs an understandable excuse. The janitor can‚Äôt do his job without the key. As a janitor, he‚Äôs allowed to have excuses. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre the janitor, reasons matter,‚Äù Jobs told his newly minted VPs. ‚ÄúSomewhere between the janitor and the CEO, reasons stop mattering.‚Äù In other words, the Rubicon of accountability is ‚Äúcrossed when the employee becomes a vice president. He or she must vacate all excuses for failure. A vice president is responsible for any mistakes that happen, and it doesn‚Äôt matter what you say.‚Äù[2](#ch6fn-2) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajxses4q990nwd4rjwd2e6d))
	- At Amazon, one of your primary directives is to identify and tenaciously manage every potential business-derailing dependency you have. It is not OK to fail because of a breakdown of dependencies. That‚Äôs a failure of leadership. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajxt5cwgxfpj22v40w66b8d))
	- In a 2003 S Team meeting, Jeff broke the process of managing dependencies into three easy steps:
	  
	  **1.**¬†¬†¬†Whenever possible, take over the dependencies so you don‚Äôt have to rely on someone else.
	  
	  **2.**¬†¬†¬†If that is impossible, negotiate and manage unambiguous and clear commitments from others.
	  
	  **3.**¬†¬†¬†Create hedges wherever possible. For every dependency, devise a fallback plan‚Äîa redundancy in a supply chain, for example. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajxvae9teh382x1qh88hfwh))
	- And since your own team is one of the most important dependencies under your authority, your ability to mentor those around you is a key metric during your annual evaluation. That means your success is intrinsically linked to the success your people have achieved over the course of their careers at Amazon. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajxwpwrg549rc7rnvkyjc30))
	- This concept of managing dependencies in a proactive manner, far beyond a normal expectation, will resonate with motivated leaders. They often ask how it‚Äôs accomplished. While there are many ways, start by asking more questions than you normally do with your colleagues. These questions help minimize the assumptions and surprises. Second, don‚Äôt just trust. Instead, trust and verify. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajy041vxtq0phzfpype0hjc))
	- idea 7: Craft a compensation structure incenting long-term enterprise value creation. Communicate the strategy and value of your compensation structure often to build alignment. When dramatic shifts are needed in a business, dramatic shifts in compensation structure become necessary. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajy7dcbf5bnbc1qx0kb8knk))
	- ‚ÄúWe pay very low cash compensation relative to most companies,‚Äù says Bezos. ‚ÄúWe also have no incentive compensation of any kind. And the reason we don‚Äôt is because it is detrimental to teamwork.‚Äù[1](#ch7fn-1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajydhmxd8ywg35jj226y6rh))
	- idea 8: Companies that have had success and that have benefited from a rise in equity appreciation are at risk of playing it safe. Find ways to keep tension in the wire for growth, innovation, and long-term enterprise goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajyfhmnsd7fc565jmnw23y2))
	- Warren Buffett refers to this disease as the ‚ÄúABCs of corporate decay‚ÄîArrogance, Bureaucracy, and Complacency.‚Äù[4](#ch8fn-4) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajyjfdpr8teeq6sykhh3qa5))
	- ‚ÄúHow would you pitch to an investor or competitor a business to compete and disrupt our existing business?‚Äù I prefer to do this as part of a retreat so that mindsets are away from the daily operations.
	  
	  Essentially, build business plans to disrupt your own business. After development, review these plans with additional external leaders (internal thinking will be limited and biased). Then conduct a board and leadership team retreat to thoroughly discuss these ideas. Use narratives (Idea 44) and future press releases (Idea 45). Go on the offense! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajyqhefakehda9g8gkrmmdw))
		- **Note**: Context: How to stay competitive and not coast on the job. How to remain an underdog and avoid playing safe.
	- The most important decisions executive management makes is where to put its resources. The essence of strategy is deciding what to say yes to and what to say no to. As in any investment portfolio, there are likely low-risk, low-reward investments, and higher-risk, higher-reward investments. Here are a few tips.
	  
	  idea 9: Innovating requires a different investment and governance mindset than what most companies typically have. If you define, manage, staff, and evaluate innovation investments the same way you do less risky investments, the system will not lead to the outcomes you‚Äôve intended. You need a different governance framework. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajysv8kzck8hj8hq9qtsq39))
	- INVEST LIKE A VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM AND CREATE AN INNOVATION PORTFOLIO
	  
	  Many companies squash innovation and invention because they want predictable results‚Äîa predictable time frame, predictable investment, predictable financial returns with moderate risk. This is how a private equity company invests. There are times when this is the right mentality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajytjqyhkwgjc2exrs9skqy))
	- In this case, the job of a successful innovator is to act like a venture capital firm.
	  
	  The key is maintaining a balanced investment portfolio and understanding the differences among its segments ([Figure 9.1](#ch9fig1)). High-risk investments need to be small experiments to prove key aspects before scaling. Think big, but act small.

	- To create significant departure and disruption from current business practices, the teams within your company that are dedicated to creating innovation need to be separated from the teams representing the status quo. In Amazon‚Äôs case, the company has a special team called Lab126 that is focused only on creating innovation in their devices. Tellingly, that team is based in California, far from the company‚Äôs Seattle base.
	  
	  While physical separation can be important, it‚Äôs more about independence from the legacy business and having unfiltered communication and collaboration with a company‚Äôs CEO or senior leader. Jeff Bezos is often referred to as ‚Äúchief product officer‚Äù for projects. It is his job to keep that team insulated while maintaining detailed collaboration and visibility with senior leadership. The separation can be physical or just organizational. But remember how difficult it is to ask a team to both run a business and invent ways to do it completely differently.

	- CRAFT THE RIGHT METRICS AND GOALS
	  
	  Hint: They‚Äôre not typically about profit. Long before a new project launched at Amazon, the team behind it would outline its goals‚Äîwhether growth, operational performance, customer experience, or costs‚Äîand create a set of metrics to measure those goals over time.
	  
	  The idea was that if the goals and metrics were right, the team could succeed with more independence and less governance. That independence would also lead to more creativity, as team members found new ways to meet those goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajz0vq6eyhy43ym04ttpxhp))
	- CREATE AN INSANELY BETTER PRODUCT OR SERVICE
	  
	  In the end, the above ingredients cannot yield a merely good product or service. It must be *insanely* good. Like jaws-to-the-floor good. This is not about marginal improvement. This is not a ‚Äúcompletely new, but still average‚Äù product. Successful innovation results in an incredible experience‚Äîat the right price point. It surprises users, and it very quickly becomes indispensable to your customers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajz24z07p87g443gvmgaj8k))
	- Over the years, as Amazon has upset the status quo and disrupted cozy business tradition after cozy business tradition with innovation, the establishment fought back with mockery and dismissals. In Bezos‚Äôs mind, this is being ‚Äúmisunderstood.‚Äù If you are going to innovate, you not only have to be willing to be misunderstood but you must also have a thick skin. To many of its competitors, Amazon makes no sense. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most befuddling, illogically sprawling, and‚Äîto a growing sea of competitors‚Äîflat-out terrifying company in the world.‚Äù[8](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch11fn-8) If you aren‚Äôt upsetting someone, you likely are not disrupting much of anything:

	- idea 10: Leaders who can design product, define architectures, and deeply understand and articulate what exactly needs to be delivered are powerful in a digital enterprise. This is a change from the traditional approach of overseeing and staying out of the details. You need to have the skills, the interest, and the insights into where to dive deep, and you need to be the designer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajz51n2q2868frzqdx3kr9p))

	- The traditional (read ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù) model of management is about managing budgets, people, and locations. The greater the managerial load, the greater the leader. The ‚Äúcoin of the realm‚Äù was typically the number of people or budget in your charge. Historically, these types of leaders would tell subordinates and consultants to ‚Äújust get it done.‚Äù While initially easy, this type of command-and-control leadership demands a whole lot of trust in those handed the task. Sometimes it goes right, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. Either way, these types of leaders rarely understand *why* something did or didn‚Äôt work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajz6nqc0qb3db7y3fvwfyk8))
	- idea 12: It is everyone‚Äôs job to figure out how to get to yes. Traditional support capabilities need to understand that they are in the business of helping their internal clients get to yes. Spend more time understanding the real objectives, and more options will become available. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hasqqxsd06ajaw7z5dek6gqj))
	- ‚ÄúMy mentor sat me down and informed me that there is no ‚ÄòNo‚Äô at Amazon. If I was going to be successful, I had to figure out solutions, no matter how complicated‚Äîand I needed to do it quickly.‚Äù[1](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch12fn-1)
	  
	  Her mentor told Reuter that if she was going to innovate, she had to be able to present options, choices, trade-offs, and opportunities. The bottom line is that, at Amazon, no one defers responsibility. Everyone works to get to yes. Amazon requires the mindset that ‚Äúwe‚Äù must get to yes. All of us. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs job to get to yes. It was Reuter‚Äôs job just as it was the job of HR or legal or finance. Everyone has the same amount of ownership and accountability about getting to yes as the core business team. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hasqzh87w688dzhjw1tvna3a))
	- REFRAME THE ISSUE
	  
	  How do you get your team to yes? Finding solutions isn‚Äôt always the obstacle. Frequently, it‚Äôs truly understanding the situation, problem, or requirements. Is the issue, ‚ÄúWhy did this fail?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do we design something that allows that component to fail?‚Äù Is the right question, ‚ÄúHow do we avoid this risk?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do we accept and mitigate this risk?‚Äù These slight tweaks in the problem statement make all the difference in how you find solutions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hasr01mbbmc80b90v3zrc4c3))
	- What is Amazon‚Äôs senior leadership‚Äôs biggest concern for their business? A competitor? Cybersecurity? Government regulation or interfer-ence? They certainly take all of these into account as they execute their seemingly unstoppable march to change every industry in the world. However, I believe the threat of creating a bureaucratic quagmire that bogs down the innovation machine driving Amazon is their greatest concern.

	- In his 2016 letter to shareholders, Bezos warned that the quickest way to become a dreaded Day 2 company was to rely on process as proxy. Good process serves the business so the business can serve customers, Bezos said, but if you‚Äôre not careful, the process will consume the outcome. ‚ÄúThis can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you‚Äôre doing the process right. Gulp. It‚Äôs not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, ‚ÄòWell, we followed the process.‚Äô A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process. The process is not the thing. It‚Äôs always worth asking, do we own the process, or does the process own us?

	- The way a consulting practice is organized and deployed offers helpful concepts here. A consulting practice is often aligned to one core axis such as geography or industry, and then a second axis such as solution. These long-lived organization alignments are used for talent management‚Äîhiring and training‚Äîand the development of intelletual property (IP). A consultant often is a assigned a performance manager as part this organization alignment. But the business of consulting is based on clients and projects or a mission. A project often requires people in a way that cuts across the primary organization structure. A project has a beginning and an end to it. And a project has one leader. So the formal organization chart helps to guide messaging to the market; it helps define and hire for the right industries and solutions; it cultivates expertise and communities around this expertise; and it helps people grow. But it‚Äôs not the way real projects with clients get done. In the real world, the project team reports to the client engagement leader. When done correctly, everyone pitches in on all topics to achieve the right results for the client. Serving the client, getting the project mission done, is the primary orientation, not the organization charts within the business ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hasrffa3ded5w1z3mzv84n9c))
	- Nonconsulting organizations should borrow from this playbook. Maintain your normal organization model and reporting hierarchy. But when there is a project or a mission to accomplish or a problem to solve, report to the leader of the initiative. Project success is measured only by the success of the initiative, hopefully to the delight of customers. This ‚Äúall hands on deck‚Äù approach is clean, clear, and simple. It cuts down countless hours of meetings and extraneous communication. It leverages the most experienced talent on your team. It promotes a culture of yes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hata50ra3rx90zc79wadsced))
	- Even with Amazon‚Äôs small-team organizational structure, the leaders sometimes find their organization chart and job descriptions not serving the immediate situation. When this happens, they will quickly form project teams pulled from across the organization. The second leadership principle, ‚ÄúOwnership,‚Äù states that a leader never gets to say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my job.‚Äù Customer obsession and metrics support the mindset of not letting job descriptions and the organizational chart get in the way of doing the right thing.

	- I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôve heard the old saying, ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt work if you love it.‚Äù Much of this book is about inspiring your team to love solving problems, to love turning a challenge around and around like a Rubik‚Äôs Cube, examining every possible permutation until the perfect solution falls into place. This passion for problem solving focuses energy on the right types of results and collaboration, and it explodes the bureaucratic mindset that organizational charts and dynamics can create. This is how innovation happens. This is how yes happens. The stakes are high, but it‚Äôs all still a game. Teach your people to love to play. They don‚Äôt always have to win. They just have to win a lot. What games might help create innovation? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hatab6z08v7nyscyfka30rg8))

	- BE OPEN TO CHANGE*Secret 1. Compete Differently*
	  
	  It‚Äôs said that the only people who like change are babies. But an appetite for change is what separates innovators from laggards, entrepreneurs from bureaucrats, and digital winners from digital losers. The professionals, teams, and companies who learn to love change, who are addicted to challenging *everything* about the status quo, are the digital winners. You must wring out the last drop of capability every single day until you and your organization are *great*. Then wash, rinse, and repeat ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf524tcnvfwfn9pyrh4a79k))
	- Because digital is neither the technology nor the social networks. Digital is competing differently by leveraging new customer experiences, lean business practices, and innovative business models, which are powered by the convergence of a wide range of technology and computer science capabilities such as cloud computing, social and mobile collaboration, and artificial intelligence and predictive analytics. Repeat. Digital is not the technology. It‚Äôs about competing differently. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf53n1efdj5ctz5wmxe9z86))
	- *Secret 2. This Time, It‚Äôs Personal*
	  
	  What people often don‚Äôt understand is that digital transformation is not just about organizational change‚Äîit‚Äôs also about *personal* change. You must be, as Gandhi said, the change you want to see in the world. The entire organization cannot be transformed if you fail to change your own personal habits. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf54a5ap7csda940ckczawy))
	- *Secret 3. Speed Matters*
	  
	  On paper, it‚Äôs simple. Digital equals speed and agility. Speed is operational excellence. Agility is the ability to make change happen. To win in digital, make everything faster and more nimble. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf551ry1re3g2pdw9ertm28))
	- Digital competition is about convenience and choice for the customers, empowering them to choose how and when they want to do business with you. It‚Äôs about erasing steps that do not add value, cut costs, improve quality, or save time. For example, ‚Äúfast fashion‚Äù companies like H&M have cut lead time from idea to product to six weeks. It‚Äôs also about providing transparency and access to your customers. Travelocity disrupted the world of travel agents and travel through one killer feature: making all options and prices available to the consumer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf5at2me8qrtj5c7bvkdwf8))
	- Finding leaders with the critical eye and instincts necessary to innovate and execute digital transformation is tough‚Äîit‚Äôs a magical skill set. Why? Mature organizations have solved their customers‚Äô problems and now measure success by profit, which means an increased focus on operational efficiency. As a result, innovation suffers.
	  
	  ‚ÄúSuch practices and policies ensure that executives can deliver meaningful earnings to the street and placate shareholders. But they also minimize the types and scale of innovation that can be pursued successfully within an organization,‚Äù wrote innovation researcher Maxwell Wessel in the *Harvard Business Review*. ‚ÄúNo company ever created a transformational growth product by asking: ‚ÄòHow can we do what we‚Äôre already doing, a tiny bit better and a tiny bit cheaper?‚Äô‚Äù[2](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch16fn-2) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf5ce9xw3krz73ezdkpcj14))
	- The key to innovation, within Amazon or your own company, is to imagine and build your own scaffolding of trial and error. According to Bezos, ‚ÄúYou need to select people who tend to be dissatisfied by a lot of the current ways. As they go about their daily experiences, they notice that little things are broken in the world, and they want to fix them. Inventors have a divine discontent.¬†.¬†. . You want to embrace high-judgment failure‚Äîthis was worth trying, it didn‚Äôt work, so let‚Äôs try something different. All of our most important successes at Amazon have been through that kind of failure: Fail, try again, and repeat that loop ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf5e1w6s1sds2kkgak4cvd2))
	- idea 17: Digital success depends on moving quickly and measuring the impact of changes through tests. It depends on identifying the right type of failure versus the wrong type of failure and carefully deciding how to define a test and evaluation. Senior leaders need to be personally involved in defining the test and reviewing results and implications ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf5j3x401hs4ps7gn4v16q5))
	- First, the customers‚Äô experience with these third-party sellers needed to be indistinguishable from their experience buying directly from Amazon, the retailer. Second, the experience of selling on Amazon‚Äôs third-party platform had to be intuitive and easy, even though the process was relatively complex. Third, we had to design the platform for and strategize around supporting hundreds of thousands‚Äînot tens or hundreds‚Äîof sellers. Managing your business at Amazon had to be self-service. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf6489nhaf48zgrern5f5we))
	- The better you become at creating ways to test repeatedly in small ways, the more likely you are to achieve big success. In other words, think big, but act small.
	  
	  It took years before the third-party business became the force that it is today. Before I even joined the Marketplace team, Amazon had already tried‚Äîand failed‚Äîto build two other third-party seller platforms. Before Amazon Marketplace, there was Amazon Auctions and then the zSHOP. The first two were failures; the third is now a huge success.
	  
	  And although Amazon certainly invested in the Marketplace business, it was not a high-risk investment. Instead, leadership invested in relatively small individual experiments that would improve Amazon‚Äôs long-term understanding of the winning formula. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf6f3najqhqavd6g5sc140v))
	- What do those smaller experiments look like? At Marketplace, we thought up front that customers would want to shop through seller-specific storefronts, so we built the infrastructure to enable sellers to create branded online storefronts. Once we actually launched storefronts, though, we found customers were actually more likely to shop by category across Amazon‚Äôs entire site. As a result, we wound up deemphasizing merchant-specific storefronts and focusing instead on improving Amazon‚Äôs core browsing and searching capabilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf6fta4zqg4dhkwc5n4m9nw))
	- It wasn‚Äôt until Marketplace eventually found the right long-term formula‚Äîthrough this and many other experiments‚Äîthat the company shifted its focus to growth.
	  
	  Successful innovators execute on lots of small experiments, and they have a patient, long-term approach to product and business success. It is rare, though not impossible, that innovation and short-term profits go together. Executed well, these kinds of small experiments help you understand your customers‚Äô needs and how your product might fit the market. Executed poorly, they can be worse than not experimenting at all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf6g6ar64swdt3t3tfbmtfe))
	- The key for the MVP is articulating, as succinctly as possible, what part or feature of your bigger vision needs to be validated or tested first (or next) and making the scope as closely limited to that feature as possible. This is the process of defining and measuring to hypothesis and quickly getting customer or real-world feedback on that test, then proceeding in as incremental or agile a manner as possible to the next test ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf6ht19m7zc987k5z50pkez))
	- A *platform* is a business model and capability that can be accessed and customized by external users. Often, these external users leverage this platform in ways you could never imagine, let alone sustain and serve. Amazon consists of more than a dozen thriving platform businesses, including AWS, Fulfillment, Payments, CreateSpace, Direct Publishing, Audible, Advertising, Flex, Instant Video, Kindle, and Mechanical Turk, to name a few. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7159x4c1v13cx0jky5b1v))
	- idea 18: Thinking about how your core capabilities could be offered as a platform might help you identify a future business strategy. It‚Äôs not for everyone. Regardless, deeply understanding what it would take will give you great ideas for improvement and innovation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf760t2f9expdy3pwettzs8))
	- What are some attributes of a platform business model? It abstracts complexity. It democratizes access and use. It has high fixed costs. It has low (zero) marginal costs. Its inventory is owned by others. It‚Äôs on demand. It features by-the-sip pricing. It has a network effect. It owns the means of connection. It is not the means of production. It features user-generated content and *other people‚Äôs work* (OPW) (see Idea 23). It is marketplace enabled. It has level and clear rules. It is programmable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf76g70af2pppzhkdwvspt4))
	- idea 19: Centralized IT serves one set of purposes for an enterprise. As more connected experiences are integrated into your products and services and more technology-enabled innovation is needed throughout, put technology resources closer to customers, and embed these into the business, where they are part of the team and product.
	  
	  The command-and-control mindset, which includes the common belief that ‚Äúmy CIO is going to manage my technology operations *and* deliver digital transformation‚Äù is yesterday‚Äôs management model and mindset. As your products and services become more digital, you need to develop a balanced understanding of what functions and decisions should be owned by the CIO (aka centralized IT) and what should be built at the edges of the business with technology capabilities built and operated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7jtqqmprkyn7bqyscsq0w))
	- WHAT REMAINS CENTRAL
	  
	  Before we shotgun the IT department to the furthest reaches of your organization, let‚Äôs touch on aspects of IT that likely should remain centralized: systems, standards, and operations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7k677fhckch29wy65pdnh))
	- First, certain systems and technology teams‚Äîespecially those with high legal and investor obligations, operating infrastructure for all technology teams, and ‚Äúorder-to-cash‚Äù systems‚Äîshould remain centralized. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7kp9q5f63gpytjbj9z1rm))
	- Typical applications and capabilities to consider centralizing in your IT organization include financial systems; systems owned by key support organizations such as finance, HR, and legal; systems with highly sensitive customer data (personally identifiable information, or PII); key infrastructure such as the data center, cloud, database, and messaging systems; employee and vendor enablement; integrated deployment environments; office productivity applications and desktop and/or device support; and perimeter and cyber threat detection technology. The operations central IT might continue to provide include operations to all the systems above, a program management office for large programs, and key vendor management operations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7mekj7z5qnhd7345tqyqk))
	- Second, it‚Äôs important to point out that the shift to decentralized technology capability does not mean that everybody does things in different ways. In fact, *standards become even more important, perhaps vital, in a decentralized model*. If we can create standards and principles under which every team deploys and operates, this will greatly enhance the speed, interoperability, and quality our teams will produce. As a result, the shift to decentralized IT will mean that the mission of central IT will grow in its ability to lead by influence through standards. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7n14zd6kb4yz94x9xanfq))
	- What types of standards are needed? Standards for system design; metrics and SLAs, APIs, and interoperability; technical documentation; tool and programming language; security (see Idea 36); program management including risk and program governance; quality, testing and release management; and support and operations, availability, performance, and graceful failure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7nvn43ezcs1rdh6x3hzrd))
	- First, technology that is part of products or core services can be distributed to these teams. Second, marketing, sales, and supply chain systems are great candidates to be integrated into their respective business organizations. These organizations need to have greater ownership over integrating technology and data into their processes and capabilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7qf3j1v7wzj3waf35z6nh))
	- When it comes to Amazon‚Äôs famous Two-Pizza Teams, most people miss the point. It‚Äôs not about the team‚Äôs size. It‚Äôs about the team‚Äôs autonomy, accountability, and entrepreneurial mindset. The Two-Pizza Team is about equipping a small team within an organization to operate independently and with agility ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7r520q8fab5ae35ksy5rx))
	- As established in Idea 13, bureaucracy is a killer to innovation. What‚Äôs more, high-performing employees are not attracted to companies or divisions in which they cannot make a difference. Small teams truly own something‚Äîa product or feature, a service like the checkout cart, or a process like the warehouse receive process. Each team defines its business plan, metrics, and product road map. This drives motivation and continuous improvement while providing transparency and accountability for future investment and results. Each team has a keen sense of customers, even if they are internal customers, and the most important orientation is to gain adoption and provide value to these customers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf88m5nrz8cjsxvzxb2c08f))
	- idea 20: Organize the digitization of core capabilities and services to be owned by small teams. This team will engineer, build, and operate a capability valued by both internal and external customers. Creating small teams results in more innovation, higher-quality work, and a stronger culture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf893mahjamkjht9kk91wwr))
	- Two-Pizza Teams are organized around capabilities and services as opposed to projects. Work is expected to continue for more than two years at a minimum, and it is improved through iteration. There are hundreds of Two-Pizza Teams at Amazon today. Many are very technical in nature, owning underlying technology services powering the business. Some are more functional, bringing together and integrating other technical services to fulfill a business objective. An example of this type of team might be the promotions team or the image team. These teams build a world-class and configurable capability that business units can use in their business. Amazon does not create all teams as Two-Pizza Teams, but it does strive to break up organizations into well-defined, mission-oriented teams. Be fixed on the vision and flexible on model to serve your needs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf8a6y1xkewzeectarx03yy))
	- First, the business owner is the leader of the team. For a technology pizza team, the programmers become the customers and the implementers; they are both writing the spec and implementing it. The team is composed only of A+ people. At Amazon, this is enforced indirectly through the Bar Raisers Award (see Idea 43).
	  
	  The Two-Pizza Team is autonomous. Interaction with other teams is limited, and when it does occur, it is well documented, and interfaces are clearly defined. It owns and is responsible for every aspect of its systems. One of the primary goals is to lower the communications overhead in organizations, including the number of meetings, coordination points, planning, testing, or releases. Teams that are more independent move faster. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf8behg481t4140z8b4pq5w))
	- The Two-Pizza Team owns its own data. No other team may access or change the data except through APIs. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are the interfaces with enforced rules allowing other teams to integrate and use the team‚Äôs capability ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf8c490myjtc9ywd9jr4wj7))
	- So how in the world does this work for teams outside the umbrella of the parent organization? Like their Two-Pizza Team compatriots inside the organization, Amazon‚Äôs external Two-Pizza Teams are tied together by a continuous measurement and reporting system whereby each team‚Äôs real-time results are accessible throughout the organization. Transparency and dedication to metrics drive the same internal culture of innovation and speed to the external teams. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbfbawjmq9bqvq86x23qgnr9))
	- Team effectiveness can be measured by a *fitness function*, which measures the impact of the teams‚Äô work‚Äîthat is, their input. The fitness function is intended to be a set of long-term metrics that measures the impact and effectiveness of the technology and/or function. It is a rigorous process to get a fitness function agreed to, and it happens well after a Two-Pizza Team is formed. It is ultimately measured in terms of customer impact and shareholder‚Äôs value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbfbc0nr6v6h8dq09w9e8ven))
	- idea 21: For most companies and teams, ‚Äúbecoming digital‚Äù requires change at all levels: strategy, business models, teams, partners, and others. Do not let your past positions be a limiting factor in what the right strategy is going forward. Things change. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbfbgdfskn9vdnykwwgp8hka))
	- Amazon and Jeff Bezos have flip-flopped on many long-held positions and strategies without batting an eyelash. ‚ÄúAdvertising is the price you pay for a mediocre product,‚Äù Bezos said at the 2009 shareholders meeting.[1](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch21fn-1) For the first couple of decades of its existence, Amazon spent essentially nothing on TV or print advertising, and the marketing budget went to fund free shipping.

	- Many great companies have landed in the gutter by guzzling their own dogmatic Kool-Aid. It‚Äôs easy to mistake strategy with core competence. Times change and situations change, so strategies need to change, and management better be willing to change along as well.

	- Many of the ideas outlined in this book are forcing functions.

And we needed to scale this to tens of thousands of sellers without adding that many employees at Amazon. It had to be done in a self-service manner. This forcing function did its intended job. We devised tools, processes, metrics, and monitoring to enable sellers to launch and operate their business at Amazon with surprisingly little support from Amazon.

	- At Amazon, having a balanced, well-engineered scorecard of metrics that is consistently reviewed day over day, week over week, provides deep insights into what works and what doesn‚Äôt. It also places sole responsibility for success and failure on you as a leader.
	  
	  Repeatable, consistent performance reflected in metrics is the gold standard for success. Without access to a consistent set of metrics, an Amazon leader would be flying blind, and such risky behavior is not acceptable at the company. Real-time metrics are the lifeblood flowing through the veins of Amazon. Real data and real insights from the customer experience are used continually to answer the question, ‚ÄúDid my customers have a good day today?‚Äù If your metrics are in place, if they are in real time, and your team members and processes use them, this question yields a simple yes or no answer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtn4mhwwjay95pj9tfbecrs))
	- It takes foresight to lead by the numbers correctly. You must embed real-time metrics from the very start of a program because they are nearly impossible to retrofit. The Amazon experience shows us that the single biggest opportunity for companies operating today is to completely rethink their concept of metrics ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtn6vqm01tk5yd2pdd9fazn))
	- SPEND MORE TIME DESIGNING YOUR METRICS
	  
	  Think about where time is allocated at a company at the executive and management levels‚Äîlots of time spent on budgeting, financial reviews, HR, and compliance, and so on. These are important. But do they really help serve customers, drive operational excellence, or spark ideas for innovation? Here are three quick steps for designing your metrics:
	  
	  **1.**¬†¬†¬†Spend time talking about what your metrics should be.
	  
	  **2.**¬†¬†¬†Have meetings that use those metrics to constantly review your business. Always look for root causes. Turn metrics to action.
	  
	  **3.**¬†¬†¬†Get as granular and real-time data as possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtn7f8k2ezqryfzj92rfnhb))
		- **Note**: Create personal metrics to measure your success.
	- Although they are called ‚Äúmetrics meetings,‚Äù they are really meetings of shared accountability where the ‚Äúowners‚Äù of related metrics discuss the most recent trends and issues in their metrics. Leaders are expected to know the details of their business, to be vocally self-critical, and to discuss plans or progress for improvement. Although successes might be recognized, the general modus operandi is to ‚Äúcelebrate for a nanosecond‚Äù and then focus on the issues and errors in the business. Even when things are generally good, they‚Äôre never perfect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtn9qs7s10tz4q92fhzmyfa))
	- Once a team‚Äôs metrics and SLAs are in place, the focus turns to data collection that will inform those metrics and SLAs. At Amazon, there are very specific standards for the quality and type of data a team should collect. Amazon‚Äôs executive team refers to those standards as ‚Äúinstrumentation.‚Äù
	  
	  Expectations on data collection‚Äîor instrumentation‚Äîat Amazon are twofold: First, data should be fine-grained in nature. You can always summarize and aggregate data, but you can‚Äôt go back and derive more detail from a data set. Second, that data should be available in real time. You can always batch data or slow it down, but you can‚Äôt speed it up. Design for no time lags and no batch systems.
	  
	  There are many reasons this is important. Let‚Äôs say a grocery company uses a refrigerated storage bin to keep its fruits and vegetables fresh. Suddenly, over the course of a day, all the lettuce goes bad. If the company has been collecting fine-grained data‚Äîfor example, any changes in temperature or pressure and their time stamps‚Äîthat grocery company might actually be able to figure out what it was that caused the lettuce to go bad. Otherwise, they‚Äôre stuck wondering about the possible variables and causes in that situation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtnbvmqpew2af0cbrby7ywg))
	- Finally, never stop reevaluating and building metrics. Frequently check to make sure that your metrics are still explicitly linked to goals, and don‚Äôt hesitate to change metrics when they stop driving change in your organization.
	  
	  Why?
	  
	  Because good metrics create good processes that minimize bureaucracy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtncdnkwd24mg02e08ftxsn))

	- The third leadership principle of Amazon is ‚ÄúInvent and Simplify.‚Äù Most find it curious that ‚Äúsimplify‚Äù shares the top billing with ‚Äúinvent‚Äù and is not buried somewhere in the description of the leadership principle. Operational leaders at Amazon think about how to scale core capabilities, knowing that keeping processes simple is the key to being able to scale them. I cannot overstate the importance of keeping it simple ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtnfgh2jdhn9gg0dvtfqech))
	- At its most basic, the ability to scale results in the production of more ‚Äúunits‚Äù through your process, on a declining cost per unit. Whether your unit is an order, a customer, or a byte, being able to ‚Äúdo more on a declining unit cost‚Äù helps you figure out how to scale the process without always just adding more people to it. These types of core processes could be services that help drive the online customer experience, such as the payments service or the image service, or they could be key back office capabilities like the inventory forecasting process or the server procurement process. These are essential capabilities that need to be world-class for the business and customer experience to excel. Not everything in the business needs to be as wired or world-class, just the essential processes differentiating your business ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtngg5brzhjnp3gjs2ne1fa))
	- idea 32: Well-defined processes help prevent bureaucracy or expose it if it exists. Build your core processes in a deliberate way as a key enabler of scale. Part of designing your processes is identifying the key services that are used in multiple ways across the enterprise. Force simplicity to triumph over complexity. Have high standards for building and operating key processes to prevent bureaucracy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtnjevn94125fde15xkqakb))
	- Having high standards and paying attention to detail to avoid these symptoms and driving accountability and world-class capability may sound unreasonable‚Äîand it is. This is the type of unreasonable expectation that Amazon has for its leaders. It is also one of the reasons Amazon is not a great place to work for many people because they will be exposed if they don‚Äôt live up to the high standards. Bureaucracy lets underperformers hide, and that‚Äôs why they like it. In his 2017 letter to shareholders, Bezos explained the benefits of high standards:
	  
	  Building a culture of high standards is well worth the effort, and there are many benefits. Naturally and most obviously, you‚Äôre going to build better products and services for customers‚Äîthis would be reason enough! Perhaps a little less obvious: people are drawn to high standards‚Äîthey help with recruiting and retention. More subtle: a culture of high standards is protective of all the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù but crucial work that goes on in every company. I‚Äôm talking about the work that no one sees. The work that gets done when no one is watching. In a high-standards culture, doing that work well is its own reward‚Äîit‚Äôs part of what it means to be a professional. And finally, high standards are fun!

	- Every year at Amazon, teams are forced to create and review a document with the executive team which outlines in excruciating detail their performance in the previous year and their plans for the upcoming year including resource asks. Operating Plan 1 (OP1) is typically a six-page narrative (with mountains of appendixes) looking at every angle of your business and can be the difference between your team getting a bunch of new resources or getting cut into oblivion (Bezos and crew aren‚Äôt shy about killing teams that aren‚Äôt performing well). While I used to gripe about the amount of our time this process would suck up, the reality is that this kind of rigorous evaluation is probably one of the reasons why Amazon is able to be so focused in their investments and grow in businesses with relatively thin margins.[1](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch37fn-1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbvksn2xnp1vtfh1wtc0cpbs))
	- idea 39: How your business designs, builds, and operates your data and technology architecture matters, and it will affect the value of your business. Architecture defines how nimble you can be and what types of risks you have. These are business considerations, and you need to make sure you are deeply involved. Don‚Äôt underinvest the time, talent, or budget. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbvmbtpv3vdxenkc9qynek9t))
	- What are the qualities or conditions‚Äîthe *-ities*‚Äîthat the data and technology architectures ideally take into consideration?
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Scalabil-ity:** The capability to quickly increase or decrease the throughput or capacity of the system.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Secur-ity:** Keeping out what you want to keep out; keeping in what you want to keep in. Isn‚Äôt that security? Security was tackled in Idea 36.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Flexibil-ity:** Multipurpose and transformable to different use cases, different geographies, similar needs with variable or conditional processing requirements.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Interoperabil-ity:** Integration and interaction with grace with other types of technology, particularly different brands of technology, and external systems. APIs are one way of creating interoperability for data and processes across an enterprise and enterprises.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Measureabil-ity:** The instrumentation and monitoring capability of the system, to be able to identify, report, and even predict how well things are running and where challenges or failures might be. This can help both IT operations, as well as business processes dependent on measures, such as tolling or billing.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Usabil-ity:** The ease and intuitive interaction between the technology and users. It is the ergonomics and machine-device interface of the technology. Usability also addresses the environmental suitabil-ity of the technology to the operating conditions.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Traceabil-ity:** The ability to track, audit, or explain how transactions, decisions, and systems processes have occurred. ‚ÄúReconciliation‚Äù is not sexy, but with Sarbanes-Oxley and other legal requirements, the ability to show how steps happened across the entire enterprise, often from a ‚Äúcash-to-cash‚Äù perspective, the ability to demonstrate that all transactions happened as they should have happened, is the essence of ‚Äúcontrol.‚Äù As more automation and machine learning are utilized, creating transparency and demonstrating how decisions are made is an aspect of traceabil-ity.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Extensibil-ity:** The essential quality of being able to efficiently meet future business needs with as minimal cost, time, and effort as possible.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Reusabil-ity:** An element of extensibility, the quality of using the same technology for multiple purposes. Modularity, object-oriented design, and appropriate abstraction are all approaches to create reusabil-ity.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Integr-ity:** In distributed architectures, where data and technology are running over multiple data centers, multiple cloud zones, and wide geographies and locations, the quality of having consistency and trustworthy authenticity, especially with data that has to be correct and have authority. The traditional example of an ‚Äúatomic transaction‚Äù in which either all aspects of a transaction successfully commit to the distributed database or the transaction rolls back is a key now being augmented with the concept of ‚Äúeventual consistency‚Äù in which the valid value for data is eventually made across all distributed versions of the data.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Modular-ity:** Creating discrete, well-defined, and separated functions of capabilities in software. A solution typically integrates multiple module services together. An important strategic notion at Amazon is that modular services need to be ‚Äúself-service‚Äù‚Äîthat is, to use your capability, someone should not need to talk to you to understand, design, test, deploy, or operate your service. This helps not only scale the technology but scale the organization.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Qual-ity:** The notion of a system doing what is expected. In technology, key enablers include the ease of being able to test and verify, deploy, manage versions, and effectively deal with software bugs.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Stabil-ity:** The ability to deal with new requirements and operating dynamics while not affecting the underlying architecture. Proper abstraction in the architecture design is the key to achieving stability. In the physical environment of computers, networks, and data centers, stabil-ity also is reflected in redundancy, failover, and disaster recovery scenarios.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**Availabil-ity:** The ability to respond immediately. As the ESPN football analysts often say about athletes and injuries, ‚Äúthe best ability is availability.‚Äù In retail, if an item is not available, you‚Äôve lost an order and often lose the customer. In technology, it is no different. Systems must be available and deliver the response times required by the user and business. Near-real-time (NRT) systems in which there is minimal lag are critical architecture notions (neither cheap nor easy) that enable many digital experiences ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbvmjrfy8s3s050q6b8xxqer))
	- Here‚Äôs a set of questions to consider asking your technology leader, which we would ask technology teams at Amazon:
	  
	  **1.**¬†¬†¬†What are our key (prioritized) technology capabilities, intellectual property (IP), and data assets? How do we measure their value and health?

	  **17.**¬†¬†¬†What technology should be package software for our business? Are we able to easily take advantage of their new features and advantages?
	  
	  **18.**¬†¬†¬†What is our technology innovation model? How do we support experimentation with new technologies and capabilities? Through what path are these ‚Äúformalized‚Äù into the ‚Äúcore‚Äù business capabilities?
	  
	  **19.**¬†¬†¬†What are the current technology opportunities? Are there new technologies that should be on our road map? What problems could they solve? What advantages could they create?

	- According to *Business Insider*, Bezos created a list of 20 products he could sell online, and he decided books were the most viable option. The problem? D.E. Shaw, his boss, disagreed. He didn‚Äôt think it would work. When Bezos insisted on leaving, Shaw advised him to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision. So that‚Äôs what he did. And faced with what, in hindsight, would amount to a world-changing decision, young Bezos turned to a process he dubbed his ‚Äúregret minimization framework.‚Äù Years later, he would explain it in an interview: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbx7w2he3m7a0prderqtmxhe))
	- I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, ‚ÄúOK, now I‚Äôm looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have.‚Äù I knew that when I was 80, I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed, I wouldn‚Äôt regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day, and so, when I thought about it that way, it was an incredibly easy decision. And I think that‚Äôs very good. If you can project yourself out to age 80 and sort of think, ‚ÄúWhat will I think at that time?‚Äù it gets you away from some of the daily pieces of confusion. You know, I left this Wall Street firm in the middle of the year. When you do that, you walk away from your annual bonus. That‚Äôs the kind of thing that in the short term can confuse you, but if you think about the long term, then you can really make good life decisions that you won‚Äôt regret later.[2](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch42fn-2) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbx7w3w1qr7cc4y2r1k5deaj))
	- It‚Äôs classic Bezos. Think long term. Forget the thrill of depositing your 1994 Wall Street bonus in your bank account today. How are you going to feel about it in 50 years? Once he established Amazon, Bezos would extrapolate this even further, considering the ramification not just decades, but even centuries and millennia in the future. When it comes to forward thinking, Bezos does not mess around. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbx7wde6seppe94fg92g36jm))
	- One of the reasons small organizations can move so much faster than big companies is the speed at which they make decisions. Indeed, decisions are not only made faster but their effects on the business are more impactful. As Amazon has grown by leaps and bounds, Bezos has devoted a great deal of time and energy to ensure that his leaders make good, fast decisions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbx7wq74q4s8d4m7xnn1n5xr))
	- ‚ÄúTo keep the energy and dynamism of Day 1, you have to somehow make high-quality, high-velocity decisions,‚Äù Bezos has said. ‚ÄúEasy for startups and very challenging for large organizations.

	- Amazon‚Äôs leaders are expected to be right, a lot. In fact, it‚Äôs a core principle. How? They must possess strong judgment, but they must also actively work to disconfirm their beliefs to avoid the pitfall of ‚Äúconfirmation bias.‚Äù Humans seek out data and points that confirm our initial opinion. (This is why Facebook is so popular. America is so politically polarized, and no one seems able to have a civil argument in public anymore. People expect to have their own opinions reflected back at them.) However, if we actively work to find alternative perspectives and data, we make better decisions. This is not an opinion. It‚Äôs a fact. Jim Collins will tell you even the most successful of businesses take that first certain step toward decline when a leader is surrounded by yes-men. Hubris sows the seeds of ruin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbx80gw449ctr03ca5aprk4a))
	- Yet how can you make balanced, unbiased, good decisions *fast*? You choose the ones that are reversible. To maintain a high decision-making velocity, you must first consider the implications of the decision. Can the result of the decision be tested and reversed, or is it permanent and, thus, untestable? At Amazon, we used the binary analogy of ‚Äúone-way versus two-way doors.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbx80pag02v39bk84cnfw2et))
	- Underlying these two examples of decision-making frameworks is the core understanding that how you make decisions is a skill and a corporate strategy. Figuring out what can be done quickly‚Äîversus the decisions that require more debate and careful discussion‚Äîmust be a core aspect of your skills and how your business operates. Do it with purpose, and talk about how you make a decision and how that approach could be used in other circumstances. If you practice enough, you‚Äôll develop the right tools, experiences, and tempo for your organization. Being digital puts a premium on making faster decisions, so evaluate how to incorporate faster decision-making as part of your digital journey.

	- I had an advisor at the Gates Foundation who was a former senior Microsoft technology leader, and he always emphasized that ‚Äúthe only features that matter are the ones that ship.‚Äù While this statement is a little anachronistic today (obviously no one is shipping software anywhere these days), he was 100 percent correct.

	- Amazon Leadership Principle 3 is ‚ÄúInvent and Simplify.‚Äù Driving toward clarity of thought through a written narrative is a key operational approach to get both invention and simplification. ‚ÄúAlmost every meeting which involves making a business decision is driven by a document,‚Äù says Llew Mason, an Amazon vice president. ‚ÄúOne of the great things about a written document is that it drives a lot of clarity in the process.‚Äù[4](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch44fn-4) Ah, clarity in thinking. Clarity on what you decide to do. Clarity on how the idea will affect users and the business.

	- Narratives at Amazon are two- or six-page documents written in complete sentences. A narrative must be expressly tailored to the situation based on the topic, the timing in the initiative, and the audience. It must flow in a way that makes sense relative to the topic and audience. It is verboten to dump excessive bullet points or slides into the narrative. Data, charts, and diagrams can be included, but they must be explained in the narrative. Appendix material is also allowed. I believe that the discipline of writing out ideas is at the heart of Amazon‚Äôs innovation process and can be replicated to the same effect. As explained by Greg Satell: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hby0f8ck90p7smzwdrafgtdm))
	- At the heart of how Amazon innovates is its six-page memo, which kicks off everything the company does. Executives must write a press release, complete with hypothetical customer reactions to the product launch. That is followed by a series of FAQs, anticipating questions customers, as well as internal stakeholders, might have. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hby0fkcjbb8mg82n74d84h91))
	- Executives at the company have stressed to me how the process forces you to think things through. You can‚Äôt gloss over problems or hide behind complexity. You actually have to work things out. All of this happens before the first meeting.

	- Why do programs and projects take too long, go over budget, become bloated, and fail to deliver according to expectations? Execution and project management technique can be reasons, but the biggest root cause is failing to accurately define the end state at the beginning. Teams want to launch quickly and start designing, building, and testing. Taking the time to write a narrative will dramatically improve the definition of what needs to be done, plus make it as small and concise as possible, so it can be done faster, cheaper, and with more agility. But writing narratives takes time, so they are done when they are done. It is difficult to predict how long it will take and how much effort will be required. It is completely reasonable to create a deadline. ‚ÄúYou have one week to write a narrative‚Äù might be appropriate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hby0gbqj12kfxfrdzjcd9vk7))
	- The process of authoring, reviewing, and deciding must be carefully considered. It must be rigorous. It must take time and effort. It is done when it‚Äôs done. What do narrative writers do wrong? They don‚Äôt spend enough time on their writing. As Bezos wrote: ‚ÄúThey mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more! .¬†.¬†. The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind.¬†.¬†. . The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope‚Äîthat a great memo probably should take a week or more.‚Äù[7](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch44fn-7) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hby0ks3e20khamqn789bhd6z))
	- It takes practice. Writing is less an artistic exercise and more a practiced skill. It‚Äôs less of a spontaneous combustion and more of a methodical construction‚Äîlike building and rebuilding the perfect birdhouse. Do you have the discipline and commitment to write in plain English your most important ideas and proposals? Other executives and big companies are recognizing how writing as a forcing function to create clarity is key to innovation. JPMorgan Chase, whom I have had a chance to talk to about many of these ideas, is using narratives as one of the ways to try to be literary, more like Amazon. ‚ÄúMr. Bezos notoriously banned slide presentations to keep Amazon in startup mode as it grew, instead asking employees to craft six-page documents complete with a press release and FAQs. Over roughly the past 18 months, JPMorgan has started a similar practice in its consumer businesses under Gordon Smith, the bank‚Äôs co-president and co-chief operating officer.‚Äù[8](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch44fn-8) Are you able and willing to commit to hard habits like writing narratives to change culture, speed, tempo, and innovation?

	- The future press release is a great approach to defining clear and lofty goals, requirements, and objectives and to building broad understanding from the start of a program or enterprise change. There are, however, rules to make this approach effective: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hby0tmrppg29xj3444ddzpn6))

	- *Rule 4.* Outline the principles used that led to success. This is the trickiest and most important aspect of the future press release. Identify the hard things accomplished, the important decisions, and the design principles that resulted in success. Discuss the issues that needed to be addressed to achieve success.

	- Once you‚Äôve written the narrative and press release, you can forecast some of the questions you‚Äôre likely to get about your product or business in a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) document. The purpose of the FAQs is to add more details to the press release and answer other business and execution questions necessary to launch. This can be either a separate document or appended to the end of your future press release.
	  
	  By proactively writing an FAQs document, you‚Äôre forcing yourself to think through the key questions about your product and helping to pre-answer the big questions your stakeholders are likely to have. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmbqezng496z98jynz6x4vd))
	- A good set of FAQs allows for the press release document to stay short and focused on what the customer gets. The FAQs document should include resolutions to issues and answers to questions that come up when you are writing the press release. It should also address questions that arise through the process of socializing the press release. A good FAQs document includes questions that define what the product is good for, how it will be leveraged by the customer, and why it will delight the customer.

	- **A2:** The belt is worn like any other belt. It is designed to fit through the belt loops, and it is designed to hold your pants up. The biggest difference is the on/off switch. When wearing the belt, make sure the belt is turned on so it is able to collect data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmbsqy678w3ndn43qvhdekh))
	- We should all strive to deliver products and services so obvious, ergonomic, and intuitive that no user manual is needed. Ironically, a great way to achieve this is to write the user manual at the outset of the product‚Äôs design and understand the user journey before you begin development.

	- idea 47: If you can‚Äôt explain how your product or service or capability will be used, you aren‚Äôt ready to build it. By developing personas, user journeys, and user manuals before building, you will gain insights to make your product better for its users. You will make smarter trade-offs and judgments throughout its development. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmc8nks8hyqz4q6p12dx93e))
	- Part of the user-focused design tool kit is the development of personas and journey maps. A *persona* is a deep articulation, as rich and as broad as possible, of the target customer of your potential product or service or business. You want to know this person inside and out when you are done. The *journey map* uses the persona to develop insights into the events, questions, and activities going on in the person‚Äôs life before, during, and after the involvement of your service.

	- Developing customer personas and mapping those customers‚Äô current journeys are terrific ways to document specific unmet needs and identify key friction points your future customers are experiencing right now. Following the path from start to your desired outcome can help you identify details and priorities that might otherwise be dealt with at too high a level or skipped over entirely.

	- It‚Äôs hard work to craft strong customer personas and journeys. It‚Äôs likely you‚Äôll need a few iterations before you really nail them. (I often need to start over more than once before I gain any real insights.) The biggest mistake you can make on these is to build them for show rather than for function. Don‚Äôt worry about the beauty of these deliverables at this point. Do worry about getting insights, talking to customers, and validating your findings with others who can bring ideas and challenges to your work.

	- Your user manual should address at least two key customer segments: the *end user* of the device or service, and if you are developing a technical product or service, the *programmer developing on your platform*:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**The end user of the device or service:** Who is the customer who will be installing, using, adjusting, and getting feedback from your product? Outline what the unpacking directions will be, what the installation process will be, how updates will happen, what the data privacy terms will be, how to use and read the device, and how to connect it. Think through all the major steps the users of the product will need to take, and include them in a close-to-real-life user manual. Forcing you or your team to keep these steps simple will lead to great product ideas, user experiences, and technology designs.
	  
	  ‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†**The programmer developing on your platform:** If you are developing a technical product or service that developers will be using, perhaps an IoT product, it includes an API allowing developers to access, deploy, integrate, and extend your product. You will also want to build a user manual for the developer. Write the interface for the API, what events will be supported, and the data to be sent and received. Give sample code snippets, and outline key operational topics such as how testing occurs and how operational status and updates are facilitated. You‚Äôll also want to use this exercise to outline key business and use terms. Are there charges involved? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmcc1db6hhx4wf2v2evmf54))
	- The move toward free cash flow as the primary financial measure at Amazon began in earnest when Warren Jenson became CFO in October 1999. The finance organization moved away from a percentage-margin focus to a cash-margin focus. Bezos loves to guffaw loudly and toss out the axiom, ‚ÄúPercentages don‚Äôt pay the light bill‚Äîcash does!‚Äù He then follows up with the question, ‚ÄúDo you want to be a $200 million company with a 20 percent margin or a $10 billion company with a 5 percent margin? I know which one I want to be!‚Äù[4](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch49fn-4) Again, the guffaw. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmftfmtrjg45z7phatbbdx0))
	- As explained in his 2004 letter to stockholders, Bezos likes the FCF model because it provides a more accurate view of actual cash generated through Amazon‚Äôs operations (primarily retail sales) that is truly free to use to do a number of things.[5](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch49fn-5) In Amazon‚Äôs model, capital expenditures are subtracted from gross cash flow. This means that the cash is available to grow the business by adding new categories, creating new businesses, scaling through technology, or paying down debt. Of course, that extra cash could also be given back to stockholders in the form of dividends (never really considered) or given back to shareholders via stock repurchases (maybe someday‚Äîno, not really).

	- Bezos believed then, as he does now, that without constant innovation, a company will stagnate. And the primary ingredient for investment in innovation is FCF. This philosophy and the need to practice it successfully drove the creation of other capabilities, such as Amazon‚Äôs robust, extremely accurate *unit economics model*. This tool allows merchants, finance analysts, and optimization modelers (known at Amazon as quant-heads) to understand how different buying decisions, process flows, fulfillment paths, and demand scenarios would affect a product‚Äôs contribution profit. This, in turn, gives Amazon the ability to understand how changes in these variables would affect FCF. Very few retailers have this in-depth financial view of their products, which thus makes decision-making and building processes that optimize the economics difficult. Amazon uses this knowledge to do things like determine the number of warehouses it needs and where they should be placed, quickly assess and respond to vendor offers, accurately measure inventory margin health, calculate to the penny the cost of holding a unit of inventory over a specified time period, and much more.

	- When I was at Amazon, there was nothing more sacred than building and keeping customer trust. The first leadership principle notes, ‚ÄúLeaders .¬†.¬†. earn and keep customer trust.‚Äù We understood intrinsically that customer trust was the brand and the enterprise. Here‚Äôs the rub. The final word. The bottom line. You are never done inventing the customer experience, which includes keeping your brand promise to your customers.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmg9jc8gvm9v1vhh5fr8a4e))
	- When I was at Amazon, we talked about ‚Äúcustomer promise‚Äù as the essence of customer trust. ‚ÄúPromise‚Äù meant the right item would arrive in the right condition at the right address at the right time. As we started launching and scaling the Marketplace business, in which independent sellers outside of the Amazon fulfillment network were responsible for shipping items to customers, we felt that ‚Äúpromise‚Äù applied there as well as to Amazon retail orders. The customers didn‚Äôt care (nor should they be required to care) whether they were buying from Amazon the retailer or from a third-party seller via Amazon. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmgafkzng8a6c6nscbxm2rn))
	- Yes, we could have just trusted our sellers to do the right thing, but we applied the mindset of ‚Äútrust, but verify.‚Äù We forced the sellers to manage all communication to the customer through us, so we could understand the issues. We obliged sellers to send shipment notifications to us, and we tracked when packages were shipped and when they were delivered through the transportation providers. We tracked the number of complaints, refunds because of item issues, and out-of-stock situations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcmgabkxg5vajn7pm7yfr2v1))
	- In other words, all the components of ‚Äúpromise.‚Äù It made selling at Amazon an intricate choreography of transactions, a far more complex process than selling at eBay. As a result, it slowed down the adoption of the Amazon Marketplace among sellers because we demanded more from them. Finally, we extended the Amazon A-to-Z guarantee to all orders. Initially, this policy extension garnered fierce internal resistance because of the financial and procedural implications in managing tens of thousands of sellers. But it was key.

	- Conversely, the most difficult clients were the large, successful companies. They typically resisted efforts to create lasting change and increase enterprise value. That‚Äôs because they often suffered from what Warren Buffett calls ‚Äúthe ABCs of business decay‚Äîarrogance, bureaucracy, and complacency.‚Äù[1](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch50fn-1) One warning sign of the ABCs is when company results become more important than keeping customer trust. The brand erodes when short-term financial results are prioritized over doing the right thing‚Äîthat is, implementing controls in the business to protect the customer.

You need to spend time writing and editing narratives. Will you commit to doing these things?
