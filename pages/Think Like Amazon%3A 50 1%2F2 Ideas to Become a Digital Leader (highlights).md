	- Companies that don‚Äôt let old models and past successes define who they are retain the potential to remain leaders and define the next era, and they are able to transition and grow through these turbulent times. Fostering and maintaining that potential requires world-class mental agility. So instead of resting on the momentum of its existing businesses, which are still growing, and trying to drive to improved profitability, Amazon is investing today in initiatives that might not pay back for years, if ever. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5w65114tk343jjdpxx9jvh))
	- Here‚Äôs how it happened. During the holiday season of 2003, we had challenges with website reliability during the busiest and most crucial time of the year. No bueno. Immediately after we wobbled through that holiday season, a task force was formed to address website scaling and reliability. This team decided to centralize computing infrastructure management. We were going to serve internal customers. Internal customers, it was discovered, are not demanding customers‚Äîonly external customers are truly demanding customers. Hence, the edict to invert the infrastructure and offer it to external developers. We learned in a hurry that developers loved the on-demand capabilities. Just like that, the strategy of AWS was developed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5wb2hjjzr3jb1085k4dapt))
		- **Note**: The creation of AWS.
	- Of course, to think like Amazon is not solely about innovation. All of this is supported by fanatical world-class operations. [Relentless.com](http://Relentless.com) was the name registered by Bezos for his startup venture, and the web address still goes to [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com). Relentless is Amazon‚Äôs attitude about operational excellence. Amazon is one of five companies that Gartner lists as ‚Äúmaster‚Äù in supply chain operations. Gartner has described Amazon as a ‚Äúbimodal‚Äù supply chain organization, unique in both its ability to operate at scale and innovate. In 2016, Amazon had 80 patents in supply chain technology alone![2](#introfn-2)
	  
	  The ability to both operate in a world-class manner and be a systematic innovator that is passionate about its customers‚Äîisn‚Äôt that what every CEO wants? This is why ‚Äúthinking like Amazon‚Äù is vital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5wd4ya9k3thd7jk75xj4kn))
	- idea 1: If you can strategize and evaluate your plans over a long period of time, you will be able to make investments and ‚Äúbets‚Äù that other businesses cannot. Identify the long-term risks and constraints in your business. You might be able to find strategic leverage by addressing them early. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5xag04m10wq5fdmg6whk7g))
	- Amazon‚Äôs second leadership principle is ‚ÄúOwnership,‚Äù by which leaders at Amazon strive to never sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. HQ2 was about long-term thinking and tackling a topic using an approach that derived many other benefits, instead of waiting until the potential leverage diminished to zero. Amazon‚Äôs leaders were not kicking the can down the road on this long-term business constraint. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5xkvc4w7tjmrkza55bh9pd))
	- If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you‚Äôre competing against a lot of people. But if you‚Äôre willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you‚Äôre now competing against a fraction of those people because very few companies are willing to do that. Just by lengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue. At Amazon we like things to work in five to seven years. We‚Äôre willing to plant seeds, let them grow‚Äîand we‚Äôre very stubborn ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5xn7cb70hxf8q45ema0mfr))
- New highlights added [[2023-09-20]] at 7:26 PM
	- Digging down, digital is about two things: speed and agility‚Äîexternally to your customers and market and internally within your organization. More specifically, it is about speed and agility wrapped in new business models, innovation, and the collection and use of an immense amount of data. *Speed* is a very precise repetitive motion. It‚Äôs about moving in one direction very efficiently, very precisely. Operational excellence at scale is the business equivalent to speed. *Agility*, on the other hand, is the attribute or skill to sense key facts, indicators, and market shifts and to quickly make changes and adjustments. Innovation in your business is driven by agility‚Äîthat is, the ability to make both big and small change happen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagjkvwebye7xsq8qnsyqjnc))
	- Amazon‚Äôs DNA is defined by these two traits: speed and agility. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagjsf9er7wdqnt2kcp79ccj))
		- **Note**: These two traits help Amazon become digital.
	- Becoming digital is about your business building these traits and competing differently. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagjt9jcbc8gxqdam0rnsret))
	- THE LONG VIEW
	  
	  Developing these traits in your own organization is not a single project. It will be difficult to develop a business case and to forecast results. Predictability will be hard to find. But you must believe in the transformational powers of data, technology, innovation, and the pursuit of perfection‚Äîapplied to all disciplines.
	  
	  To succeed, it is vital to take the long view. Constant knee-jerk reactions to the quarter-to-quarter mentality that drives most American business is not only inefficient. It‚Äôs also toxic to your culture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagjv91ymcvfeyyy1ym8z5zh))
	- idea 2: You will stick through the hard times if you are passionate about the cause and the customer. Consistent messaging regarding the mission will take the ‚Äúmildly interested‚Äù majority of employees in most organizations and make them fanatics for your business, for winning, and for the mission. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagjy2tgntj7s4e5n2ngy3ae))
	- it‚Äôs clear my intrinsic interest has been to improve business performance through three approaches: (1) efficiency, or creating processes that yield better quality with lower costs; (2) integration across disparate processes, data, systems, and ecosystems to create seamless capabilities; and (3) the development of new business models and capabilities allowing a business to compete differently. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagjyyy8vt478gxmc0tchcfd))
	- Ultimately, financial returns and sales are output metrics. As a leader, you don‚Äôt have direct control over them. They are the result of many other things you do. What you can control are the inputs. To win in digital, you must be deeply connected to your customers and users because that‚Äôs where the insights are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagkknhbk1hegqxvn44r33c5))
	- BUILDING A PATRIOT
	  
	  Jeff talks a lot about how mission-driven teams build better products. That‚Äôs great, but what does it mean to be mission driven?
	  
	  It‚Äôs said that wars are won by patriots, not mercenaries. We fight and care differently if we have a stake in the outcome of the war, if the commitment is cemented by something personal. And while it is great if the cement is mixed with a deep passion for the customer, a cement mixed with other ingredients can be just as strong and beneficial to the cause.
	  
	  Here‚Äôs the deal. Most employees don‚Äôt start off as patriots. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagkn059tazjr5j547st0b0r))
		- **Note**: Mercenaries are those people who are motivated by money.
	- I started by writing out this vision and understanding, holding several town hall meetings, and making the connection that ‚Äúmerchant obsession‚Äù was key to winning in this business. And, boy, did we need this business to work for us. The pressure was immense. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagnpp4mjb1mnhnqf968zwdx))
		- **Note**: Context: Growing Amazon third party. Customer obsession was already established but third-party sellers were treated as second-class citizens.
	- BEZOS‚ÄôS POINT OF VIEW
	  
	  Jeff talks about the need for a committed, customer-obsessed team. Quite frankly, it‚Äôs one of his greatest hits, and he plays it often:
	  
	  I strongly believe that missionaries make better products. They care more. For a missionary, it‚Äôs not just about the business. There has to be a business, and the business has to make sense, but that‚Äôs not why you do it. You do it because you have something meaningful that motivates you.[1](#ch2fn-1)
	  
	  Jeff‚Äôs point is clear and hard to debate. But it is also incomplete. It‚Äôs incomplete because it doesn‚Äôt explain that the business or team mission has to be aligned with every individual‚Äôs mission. Furthermore, if the opinion is that people can‚Äôt develop this mission if they don‚Äôt have it when entering a business, then hiring or transitioning a team gets tricky. Define the mission, figure out how it connects to passions, interests, and personal missions, and consistently integrate the mission in communications and meetings. You will be able to bring much more of the team along. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagnsxthh8gp6j12zhf19cf6))
	- Jeff, what does Day 2 look like? That‚Äôs a question I just got at our most recent all-hands meeting. I‚Äôve been reminding people that it‚Äôs Day 1 for a couple of decades. I work in an Amazon building named Day 1, and when I moved buildings, I took the name with me. I spend time thinking about this topic.
	  
	  Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1. To be sure, this kind of decline would happen in extreme slow motion. An established company might harvest Day 2 for decades, but the final result would still come.
	  
	  I‚Äôm interested in the question, how do you fend off Day 2? What are the techniques and tactics? How do you keep the vitality of Day 1, even inside a large organization? Such a question can‚Äôt have a simple answer. There will be many elements, multiple paths, and many traps. I don‚Äôt know the whole answer, but I may know bits of it. Here‚Äôs a starter pack of essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and high-velocity decision making.[1](#ch3fn-1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagqjtya0gt5tesjep7z86k2))
	- Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs interesting to me about Jeff‚Äôs starter pack of essentials‚Äîthey are all elements of culture. They define our priorities and how we work together. They are neither financial goals nor market goals. They are *fully* within the leaders‚Äô control, not the market‚Äôs or competitors‚Äô.
	  
	  While Jeff is focused on fending off Day 2, I‚Äôm interested in the questions, ‚ÄúWhat do you do if you are already a Day 2 company? How do you change course? Do you just accept your fate? If so, isn‚Äôt this a form of quitting? Or do you accept the risk and pain, and figure out how to move forward?‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagqkdrgjzmqebjr3xgwnygf))
	- Amazon‚Äôs Leadership Principle 11 is ‚ÄúEarn Trust,‚Äù which means being ‚Äúvocally self-critical even when doing so is awkward and embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team‚Äôs body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.‚Äù[2](#ch3fn-2) Start business or operations reviews with perspectives like ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how my team/business/operation sucked,‚Äù and then list the metrics and root causes. Discuss how you are going to fix them and what you need from others. If you start ‚Äúfeaturing the bad news,‚Äù the stigma goes away, but it takes bold leadership. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hags3xpyezct34z2tqegzpkq))
	- *Change the Questions You Are Asking*
	  
	  Ask questions that impose constraints (‚ÄúHow would we make our product/service/capability completely ‚Äòself-service‚Äô‚Äù?). Ask questions that create more customer empathy (‚ÄúWhat is our customer‚Äôs worst day?‚Äù). Ask questions that pose a different reality (‚ÄúHow would our product or service be completely ‚Äòsoftware defined‚Äô‚Äù?).
	  
	  Be purposeful and deliberate in fleshing out scenarios and potential answers to these questions. Use narratives (Idea 44) or future press releases (Idea 45). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagscp7ecpv29817ersqz2e0))
	- *Be on Target with Communication* Always
	  
	  To your team, to your investors, to your board, to your customers‚Äîeveryone in a leadership role needs to commit and be on point in their communications. Change does not happen with a memo or one meeting and declaration. Your priorities, your actions, and your communications need to always line up with your plan. Communications need to be both scheduled and planned, as well as spontaneous.
	  
	  Equip yourself and your leaders with message points to incorporate in everything you and they do. Repeat. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagsdayavxpn7rvk8kehhv4r))
	- idea 4: It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs job to know and have empathy and passion for the customer. Make sure everyone knows it‚Äôs their job. Find many ways to deliberately practice and build this expectation. Dive deep into the issues experienced by customers (or other key stakeholders), and don‚Äôt delegate figuring out the root causes. Know the details of the customer experience and what causes friction for customers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagsjkfx1cgs387pd3cte6d0))
	- What are the different methods of systematically creating and practicing customer obsession? Here‚Äôs a smattering of approaches:
	  
	  **1.**¬†¬†¬†**Use metrics that measure the customer experience.** We will talk more about metrics in Idea 31, but create metrics that measure *all* phases of the customer experience. Find a way to measure it rather than just surveying it. This will lead to innovation. Be creative in measuring as much of the customer experience as possible, even in nondigital experiences. You *can* measure the waiting time customers are experiencing in a real-time manner. Don‚Äôt use ‚ÄúWe are not a digital business or product‚Äù as an excuse. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajc14dtw9ad5k67g3zb0d19))
	- **2.**¬†¬†¬†**Create a voice of the customer program.** Create a voice of the customer program that not only highlights a customer issue but also assigns prioritized action items and work for any teams needed to fix the root cause. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajc1h1zhzm7jtebrhq5y9ef))
	- **3.**¬†¬†¬†**Everything starts with describing ‚Äúcustomer delight.‚Äù** In your narratives, your results, your shareholder letters, your plans, your strategies, your documentation, start with describing what delights your customer about this topic. If you can‚Äôt identify the customer impact, should you be spending time on it? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajc27dcm2fks7z08vhjq8ny))
	- **4.**¬†¬†¬†**Manage by walking around.** Spend considerable time as a customer, with your sales and service team, and interview the front line of your partners. Don‚Äôt rely too much on surveys because they don‚Äôt deliver many deep insights. Also, don‚Äôt rely solely on common proxies such as market reports or other summarized material‚Äîbecause they typically work only to confirm our opinion. Instead, you want to disconfirm your beliefs and opinions, and you want to understand the specific moments when you are disappointing a customer, gathering as many details of the situation as you can. *Management by walking around* (MBWA) is the practice of managers getting out of their ivory towers and spending time with customers and in the field so that they can gain better insight and empathy for what is really happening. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajc31mxasqqb2ef8zy5dw76))
	- THE RESULTS ARE NOT JUST CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
	  
	  By making customer obsession everyone‚Äôs job, you hope that customer satisfaction will improve. That would be great, but in baseball parlance, I consider this a ‚Äúsingle.‚Äù Customer obsession leads to operational excellence, which we will discuss more in Idea 22. However, the ‚Äúhome run,‚Äù nay the ‚Äúgrand slam,‚Äù of customer obsession is to build on customer satisfaction and operational excellence. The grand slam is innovation and business model evolution‚Äîbecoming inspired to develop and expand beyond your current products, services, and business model.
	  
	  Amazon‚Äôs sophisticated logistics expertise did not come from wanting to be a supply chain company. It came from understanding that the customer experience was greatly affected by flexibility, speed, and quality of delivery. Amazon Web Services (AWS) did not come from wanting to be a cloud technology company but from needing to provide a scalable infrastructure to provide a great online customer experience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajcj7g4rjzyn4qpdwnfb32w))
	- Amazon is known as a demanding place to work. It‚Äôs not for everyone. You could say the company is ‚Äúaggressive.‚Äù Aggressive for results‚Äîthat is, the right types of results. Aggressive for people to produce and have mastery of their domain. Aggressive for teams and leaders to achieve the impossible: perfection. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajckgf2m9qjz7tsdpwc4kt9))
	- Think about how most large companies operate. Big-company politics tend to rule the day. Discussions are not forthright. Meetings are layered in so much posturing and subtle deception, they are downright Shakespearean. Seniority and titles matter more than having the right data or insight. People speak out of both sides of their mouths. They smile and nod their heads yes without agreeing. In this world, civility is more important than being right. Results suffer for the sake of harmony. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajcnhh8mernbed0xy87gk3q))
	- idea 5: Make being right the most important thing. Set the tone from the top that we will win by doing the right thing, having honest conversations leading with customer obsession and data, seeking perfection through data, and ignoring job titles, while still treating each other with respect. Many of the ideas in this book will help reinforce this principle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajcnztahkh99ts3dey53gwr))
	- Of all Jeff‚Äôs management notions, perhaps the most distinctive is his belief that harmony is often overvalued in the workplace, that it can stifle honest critique and encourage polite praise for flawed ideas and execution. Instead, Amazonians are instructed to ‚ÄúDisagree and Commit‚Äù (Leadership Principle 13)‚Äîto vigorously debate colleagues‚Äô ideas with feedback that can be painfully blunt before lining up behind a decision.
	  
	  ‚ÄúWe always want to arrive at the right answer,‚Äù said Tony Galbato, Amazon‚Äôs vice president for human resources, in an e-mail statement. ‚ÄúIt would certainly be much easier and socially cohesive to just compromise and not debate, but that may lead to the wrong decision.‚Äù[1](#ch5fn-1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajcpq9zfej8646y9ytaetba))
	- Amazon has a name for the approach of getting at intellectual honesty and being self-critical. It‚Äôs called ‚Äútruth seeking,‚Äù the goal of which is to avoid consensus-based social cohesion where nobody has to be wrong and to get to the right answer or insight. Bezos‚Äôs belief is that if you are a truth-seeking company competing against a compromise company, you will win. Don‚Äôt fall into being a compromise company when it is possible to measure and define the truth. This is ‚Äúfeaturing the bad news.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajcqp8vfsy5avawy0rg88z9))
	- If getting along is more valued than being right, the business will become more about getting along than about doing the right thing over time. This value seeps in slowly, but definitively. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajwdbwfw3vbs5tsspf27tq9))
	- Bezos abhors what he calls ‚Äúsocial cohesion‚Äù‚Äîthat is, the natural impulse to seek consensus.[2](#ch5fn-2) He‚Äôd rather his employees battle it out with numerical swords and customer passion. He has codified this approach in one of Amazon‚Äôs 14 leadership principles, the company‚Äôs highly prized values that are inculcated into new hires and discussed throughout each employee‚Äôs life cycle in the organization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajwec7zc4bx34k1m7qezcyn))
	- Consensus poses two dangers for the business trying to be innovative. The first danger is that hard, honest, forthright conversations are not being had. The second danger is that ideas that are truly innovative tend to be counterintuitive, and they often seem stupid, impossible, counterproductive, or all three.
	  
	  WHAT TO DO?
	  
	  **1.**¬†¬†¬†**Test it through practice.** Try to catch moments when honest conversations are not taking place. Be purposeful in communicating that both parties demand rigorous thought and execution. And while both parties must be respectful of others, the business needs *both* demanding conversations and respect.
	  
	  **2.**¬†¬†¬†*Slow down* **certain conversations and meetings.** Debate the issue, and review the type of conversation you are having and the principles or approach you are taking in making decisions. This helps the team get better at understanding why we are making a decision in a certain manner.
	  
	  **3.**¬†¬†¬†**Use metrics and service-level agreements (SLAs).** Hold each other accountable with metrics, service-level agreements (SLAs), and deep root-cause conversations. Root-cause conversations often take considerable effort, and you must be disciplined to understand the multiple improvements that might be needed. Exercises like asking ‚Äúthe five whys‚Äù where you ask ‚ÄúWhy did this happen‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy did I allow this to affect my business‚Äù five times help to get past superficial answers and get to the real root cause. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajxfa5f19hs1vp4j283j2h5))
	- idea 6: Set the expectation that leaders cannot point the finger at others if they don‚Äôt achieve the right results. Demonstrate how to better manage dependencies so they can better deliver outstanding results in distributed organizations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajxps1a6527av44d033tsa9))
	- Willink‚Äôs book reminds me of an Adam Lashinsky story regarding Steve Jobs and Apple‚Äôs vice presidents and janitors, which I will paraphrase here.
	  
	  According to Lashinksy, Steve Jobs told employees a short story when they were promoted to vice president at Apple. Jobs would tell the VP that if the garbage in his office was not being emptied, Jobs would naturally demand an explanation from the janitor. ‚ÄúWell, the lock on the door was changed,‚Äù the janitor could reasonably respond. ‚ÄúAnd I couldn‚Äôt get a key.‚Äù It‚Äôs an irritation for Jobs, but the janitor‚Äôs response is reasonable. It‚Äôs an understandable excuse. The janitor can‚Äôt do his job without the key. As a janitor, he‚Äôs allowed to have excuses. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre the janitor, reasons matter,‚Äù Jobs told his newly minted VPs. ‚ÄúSomewhere between the janitor and the CEO, reasons stop mattering.‚Äù In other words, the Rubicon of accountability is ‚Äúcrossed when the employee becomes a vice president. He or she must vacate all excuses for failure. A vice president is responsible for any mistakes that happen, and it doesn‚Äôt matter what you say.‚Äù[2](#ch6fn-2) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajxses4q990nwd4rjwd2e6d))
	- At Amazon, one of your primary directives is to identify and tenaciously manage every potential business-derailing dependency you have. It is not OK to fail because of a breakdown of dependencies. That‚Äôs a failure of leadership. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajxt5cwgxfpj22v40w66b8d))
	- In a 2003 S Team meeting, Jeff broke the process of managing dependencies into three easy steps:
	  
	  **1.**¬†¬†¬†Whenever possible, take over the dependencies so you don‚Äôt have to rely on someone else.
	  
	  **2.**¬†¬†¬†If that is impossible, negotiate and manage unambiguous and clear commitments from others.
	  
	  **3.**¬†¬†¬†Create hedges wherever possible. For every dependency, devise a fallback plan‚Äîa redundancy in a supply chain, for example. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajxvae9teh382x1qh88hfwh))
	- And since your own team is one of the most important dependencies under your authority, your ability to mentor those around you is a key metric during your annual evaluation. That means your success is intrinsically linked to the success your people have achieved over the course of their careers at Amazon. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajxwpwrg549rc7rnvkyjc30))
	- This concept of managing dependencies in a proactive manner, far beyond a normal expectation, will resonate with motivated leaders. They often ask how it‚Äôs accomplished. While there are many ways, start by asking more questions than you normally do with your colleagues. These questions help minimize the assumptions and surprises. Second, don‚Äôt just trust. Instead, trust and verify. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajy041vxtq0phzfpype0hjc))
	- idea 7: Craft a compensation structure incenting long-term enterprise value creation. Communicate the strategy and value of your compensation structure often to build alignment. When dramatic shifts are needed in a business, dramatic shifts in compensation structure become necessary. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajy7dcbf5bnbc1qx0kb8knk))
	- ‚ÄúWe pay very low cash compensation relative to most companies,‚Äù says Bezos. ‚ÄúWe also have no incentive compensation of any kind. And the reason we don‚Äôt is because it is detrimental to teamwork.‚Äù[1](#ch7fn-1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajydhmxd8ywg35jj226y6rh))
	- idea 8: Companies that have had success and that have benefited from a rise in equity appreciation are at risk of playing it safe. Find ways to keep tension in the wire for growth, innovation, and long-term enterprise goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajyfhmnsd7fc565jmnw23y2))
	- Warren Buffett refers to this disease as the ‚ÄúABCs of corporate decay‚ÄîArrogance, Bureaucracy, and Complacency.‚Äù[4](#ch8fn-4) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajyjfdpr8teeq6sykhh3qa5))
	- ‚ÄúHow would you pitch to an investor or competitor a business to compete and disrupt our existing business?‚Äù I prefer to do this as part of a retreat so that mindsets are away from the daily operations.
	  
	  Essentially, build business plans to disrupt your own business. After development, review these plans with additional external leaders (internal thinking will be limited and biased). Then conduct a board and leadership team retreat to thoroughly discuss these ideas. Use narratives (Idea 44) and future press releases (Idea 45). Go on the offense! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajyqhefakehda9g8gkrmmdw))
		- **Note**: Context: How to stay competitive and not coast on the job. How to remain an underdog and avoid playing safe.
	- The most important decisions executive management makes is where to put its resources. The essence of strategy is deciding what to say yes to and what to say no to. As in any investment portfolio, there are likely low-risk, low-reward investments, and higher-risk, higher-reward investments. Here are a few tips.
	  
	  idea 9: Innovating requires a different investment and governance mindset than what most companies typically have. If you define, manage, staff, and evaluate innovation investments the same way you do less risky investments, the system will not lead to the outcomes you‚Äôve intended. You need a different governance framework. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajysv8kzck8hj8hq9qtsq39))
	- INVEST LIKE A VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM AND CREATE AN INNOVATION PORTFOLIO
	  
	  Many companies squash innovation and invention because they want predictable results‚Äîa predictable time frame, predictable investment, predictable financial returns with moderate risk. This is how a private equity company invests. There are times when this is the right mentality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajytjqyhkwgjc2exrs9skqy))
	- In this case, the job of a successful innovator is to act like a venture capital firm.
	  
	  The key is maintaining a balanced investment portfolio and understanding the differences among its segments ([Figure 9.1](#ch9fig1)). High-risk investments need to be small experiments to prove key aspects before scaling. Think big, but act small.

	- To create significant departure and disruption from current business practices, the teams within your company that are dedicated to creating innovation need to be separated from the teams representing the status quo. In Amazon‚Äôs case, the company has a special team called Lab126 that is focused only on creating innovation in their devices. Tellingly, that team is based in California, far from the company‚Äôs Seattle base.
	  
	  While physical separation can be important, it‚Äôs more about independence from the legacy business and having unfiltered communication and collaboration with a company‚Äôs CEO or senior leader. Jeff Bezos is often referred to as ‚Äúchief product officer‚Äù for projects. It is his job to keep that team insulated while maintaining detailed collaboration and visibility with senior leadership. The separation can be physical or just organizational. But remember how difficult it is to ask a team to both run a business and invent ways to do it completely differently.

	- CRAFT THE RIGHT METRICS AND GOALS
	  
	  Hint: They‚Äôre not typically about profit. Long before a new project launched at Amazon, the team behind it would outline its goals‚Äîwhether growth, operational performance, customer experience, or costs‚Äîand create a set of metrics to measure those goals over time.
	  
	  The idea was that if the goals and metrics were right, the team could succeed with more independence and less governance. That independence would also lead to more creativity, as team members found new ways to meet those goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajz0vq6eyhy43ym04ttpxhp))
	- CREATE AN INSANELY BETTER PRODUCT OR SERVICE
	  
	  In the end, the above ingredients cannot yield a merely good product or service. It must be *insanely* good. Like jaws-to-the-floor good. This is not about marginal improvement. This is not a ‚Äúcompletely new, but still average‚Äù product. Successful innovation results in an incredible experience‚Äîat the right price point. It surprises users, and it very quickly becomes indispensable to your customers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajz24z07p87g443gvmgaj8k))
	- Over the years, as Amazon has upset the status quo and disrupted cozy business tradition after cozy business tradition with innovation, the establishment fought back with mockery and dismissals. In Bezos‚Äôs mind, this is being ‚Äúmisunderstood.‚Äù If you are going to innovate, you not only have to be willing to be misunderstood but you must also have a thick skin. To many of its competitors, Amazon makes no sense. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most befuddling, illogically sprawling, and‚Äîto a growing sea of competitors‚Äîflat-out terrifying company in the world.‚Äù[8](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch11fn-8) If you aren‚Äôt upsetting someone, you likely are not disrupting much of anything:

	- idea 10: Leaders who can design product, define architectures, and deeply understand and articulate what exactly needs to be delivered are powerful in a digital enterprise. This is a change from the traditional approach of overseeing and staying out of the details. You need to have the skills, the interest, and the insights into where to dive deep, and you need to be the designer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajz51n2q2868frzqdx3kr9p))

	- The traditional (read ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù) model of management is about managing budgets, people, and locations. The greater the managerial load, the greater the leader. The ‚Äúcoin of the realm‚Äù was typically the number of people or budget in your charge. Historically, these types of leaders would tell subordinates and consultants to ‚Äújust get it done.‚Äù While initially easy, this type of command-and-control leadership demands a whole lot of trust in those handed the task. Sometimes it goes right, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. Either way, these types of leaders rarely understand *why* something did or didn‚Äôt work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hajz6nqc0qb3db7y3fvwfyk8))
	- idea 12: It is everyone‚Äôs job to figure out how to get to yes. Traditional support capabilities need to understand that they are in the business of helping their internal clients get to yes. Spend more time understanding the real objectives, and more options will become available. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hasqqxsd06ajaw7z5dek6gqj))
	- ‚ÄúMy mentor sat me down and informed me that there is no ‚ÄòNo‚Äô at Amazon. If I was going to be successful, I had to figure out solutions, no matter how complicated‚Äîand I needed to do it quickly.‚Äù[1](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch12fn-1)
	  
	  Her mentor told Reuter that if she was going to innovate, she had to be able to present options, choices, trade-offs, and opportunities. The bottom line is that, at Amazon, no one defers responsibility. Everyone works to get to yes. Amazon requires the mindset that ‚Äúwe‚Äù must get to yes. All of us. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs job to get to yes. It was Reuter‚Äôs job just as it was the job of HR or legal or finance. Everyone has the same amount of ownership and accountability about getting to yes as the core business team. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hasqzh87w688dzhjw1tvna3a))
	- REFRAME THE ISSUE
	  
	  How do you get your team to yes? Finding solutions isn‚Äôt always the obstacle. Frequently, it‚Äôs truly understanding the situation, problem, or requirements. Is the issue, ‚ÄúWhy did this fail?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do we design something that allows that component to fail?‚Äù Is the right question, ‚ÄúHow do we avoid this risk?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do we accept and mitigate this risk?‚Äù These slight tweaks in the problem statement make all the difference in how you find solutions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hasr01mbbmc80b90v3zrc4c3))
	- What is Amazon‚Äôs senior leadership‚Äôs biggest concern for their business? A competitor? Cybersecurity? Government regulation or interfer-ence? They certainly take all of these into account as they execute their seemingly unstoppable march to change every industry in the world. However, I believe the threat of creating a bureaucratic quagmire that bogs down the innovation machine driving Amazon is their greatest concern.

	- In his 2016 letter to shareholders, Bezos warned that the quickest way to become a dreaded Day 2 company was to rely on process as proxy. Good process serves the business so the business can serve customers, Bezos said, but if you‚Äôre not careful, the process will consume the outcome. ‚ÄúThis can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you‚Äôre doing the process right. Gulp. It‚Äôs not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, ‚ÄòWell, we followed the process.‚Äô A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process. The process is not the thing. It‚Äôs always worth asking, do we own the process, or does the process own us?

	- The way a consulting practice is organized and deployed offers helpful concepts here. A consulting practice is often aligned to one core axis such as geography or industry, and then a second axis such as solution. These long-lived organization alignments are used for talent management‚Äîhiring and training‚Äîand the development of intelletual property (IP). A consultant often is a assigned a performance manager as part this organization alignment. But the business of consulting is based on clients and projects or a mission. A project often requires people in a way that cuts across the primary organization structure. A project has a beginning and an end to it. And a project has one leader. So the formal organization chart helps to guide messaging to the market; it helps define and hire for the right industries and solutions; it cultivates expertise and communities around this expertise; and it helps people grow. But it‚Äôs not the way real projects with clients get done. In the real world, the project team reports to the client engagement leader. When done correctly, everyone pitches in on all topics to achieve the right results for the client. Serving the client, getting the project mission done, is the primary orientation, not the organization charts within the business ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hasrffa3ded5w1z3mzv84n9c))
	- Nonconsulting organizations should borrow from this playbook. Maintain your normal organization model and reporting hierarchy. But when there is a project or a mission to accomplish or a problem to solve, report to the leader of the initiative. Project success is measured only by the success of the initiative, hopefully to the delight of customers. This ‚Äúall hands on deck‚Äù approach is clean, clear, and simple. It cuts down countless hours of meetings and extraneous communication. It leverages the most experienced talent on your team. It promotes a culture of yes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hata50ra3rx90zc79wadsced))
	- Even with Amazon‚Äôs small-team organizational structure, the leaders sometimes find their organization chart and job descriptions not serving the immediate situation. When this happens, they will quickly form project teams pulled from across the organization. The second leadership principle, ‚ÄúOwnership,‚Äù states that a leader never gets to say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my job.‚Äù Customer obsession and metrics support the mindset of not letting job descriptions and the organizational chart get in the way of doing the right thing.

	- I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôve heard the old saying, ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt work if you love it.‚Äù Much of this book is about inspiring your team to love solving problems, to love turning a challenge around and around like a Rubik‚Äôs Cube, examining every possible permutation until the perfect solution falls into place. This passion for problem solving focuses energy on the right types of results and collaboration, and it explodes the bureaucratic mindset that organizational charts and dynamics can create. This is how innovation happens. This is how yes happens. The stakes are high, but it‚Äôs all still a game. Teach your people to love to play. They don‚Äôt always have to win. They just have to win a lot. What games might help create innovation? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hatab6z08v7nyscyfka30rg8))

	- BE OPEN TO CHANGE*Secret 1. Compete Differently*
	  
	  It‚Äôs said that the only people who like change are babies. But an appetite for change is what separates innovators from laggards, entrepreneurs from bureaucrats, and digital winners from digital losers. The professionals, teams, and companies who learn to love change, who are addicted to challenging *everything* about the status quo, are the digital winners. You must wring out the last drop of capability every single day until you and your organization are *great*. Then wash, rinse, and repeat ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf524tcnvfwfn9pyrh4a79k))
	- Because digital is neither the technology nor the social networks. Digital is competing differently by leveraging new customer experiences, lean business practices, and innovative business models, which are powered by the convergence of a wide range of technology and computer science capabilities such as cloud computing, social and mobile collaboration, and artificial intelligence and predictive analytics. Repeat. Digital is not the technology. It‚Äôs about competing differently. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf53n1efdj5ctz5wmxe9z86))
	- *Secret 2. This Time, It‚Äôs Personal*
	  
	  What people often don‚Äôt understand is that digital transformation is not just about organizational change‚Äîit‚Äôs also about *personal* change. You must be, as Gandhi said, the change you want to see in the world. The entire organization cannot be transformed if you fail to change your own personal habits. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf54a5ap7csda940ckczawy))
	- *Secret 3. Speed Matters*
	  
	  On paper, it‚Äôs simple. Digital equals speed and agility. Speed is operational excellence. Agility is the ability to make change happen. To win in digital, make everything faster and more nimble. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf551ry1re3g2pdw9ertm28))
	- Digital competition is about convenience and choice for the customers, empowering them to choose how and when they want to do business with you. It‚Äôs about erasing steps that do not add value, cut costs, improve quality, or save time. For example, ‚Äúfast fashion‚Äù companies like H&M have cut lead time from idea to product to six weeks. It‚Äôs also about providing transparency and access to your customers. Travelocity disrupted the world of travel agents and travel through one killer feature: making all options and prices available to the consumer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf5at2me8qrtj5c7bvkdwf8))
	- Finding leaders with the critical eye and instincts necessary to innovate and execute digital transformation is tough‚Äîit‚Äôs a magical skill set. Why? Mature organizations have solved their customers‚Äô problems and now measure success by profit, which means an increased focus on operational efficiency. As a result, innovation suffers.
	  
	  ‚ÄúSuch practices and policies ensure that executives can deliver meaningful earnings to the street and placate shareholders. But they also minimize the types and scale of innovation that can be pursued successfully within an organization,‚Äù wrote innovation researcher Maxwell Wessel in the *Harvard Business Review*. ‚ÄúNo company ever created a transformational growth product by asking: ‚ÄòHow can we do what we‚Äôre already doing, a tiny bit better and a tiny bit cheaper?‚Äô‚Äù[2](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch16fn-2) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf5ce9xw3krz73ezdkpcj14))
	- The key to innovation, within Amazon or your own company, is to imagine and build your own scaffolding of trial and error. According to Bezos, ‚ÄúYou need to select people who tend to be dissatisfied by a lot of the current ways. As they go about their daily experiences, they notice that little things are broken in the world, and they want to fix them. Inventors have a divine discontent.¬†.¬†. . You want to embrace high-judgment failure‚Äîthis was worth trying, it didn‚Äôt work, so let‚Äôs try something different. All of our most important successes at Amazon have been through that kind of failure: Fail, try again, and repeat that loop ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf5e1w6s1sds2kkgak4cvd2))
	- idea 17: Digital success depends on moving quickly and measuring the impact of changes through tests. It depends on identifying the right type of failure versus the wrong type of failure and carefully deciding how to define a test and evaluation. Senior leaders need to be personally involved in defining the test and reviewing results and implications ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf5j3x401hs4ps7gn4v16q5))
	- First, the customers‚Äô experience with these third-party sellers needed to be indistinguishable from their experience buying directly from Amazon, the retailer. Second, the experience of selling on Amazon‚Äôs third-party platform had to be intuitive and easy, even though the process was relatively complex. Third, we had to design the platform for and strategize around supporting hundreds of thousands‚Äînot tens or hundreds‚Äîof sellers. Managing your business at Amazon had to be self-service. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf6489nhaf48zgrern5f5we))
	- The better you become at creating ways to test repeatedly in small ways, the more likely you are to achieve big success. In other words, think big, but act small.
	  
	  It took years before the third-party business became the force that it is today. Before I even joined the Marketplace team, Amazon had already tried‚Äîand failed‚Äîto build two other third-party seller platforms. Before Amazon Marketplace, there was Amazon Auctions and then the zSHOP. The first two were failures; the third is now a huge success.
	  
	  And although Amazon certainly invested in the Marketplace business, it was not a high-risk investment. Instead, leadership invested in relatively small individual experiments that would improve Amazon‚Äôs long-term understanding of the winning formula. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf6f3najqhqavd6g5sc140v))
	- What do those smaller experiments look like? At Marketplace, we thought up front that customers would want to shop through seller-specific storefronts, so we built the infrastructure to enable sellers to create branded online storefronts. Once we actually launched storefronts, though, we found customers were actually more likely to shop by category across Amazon‚Äôs entire site. As a result, we wound up deemphasizing merchant-specific storefronts and focusing instead on improving Amazon‚Äôs core browsing and searching capabilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf6fta4zqg4dhkwc5n4m9nw))
	- It wasn‚Äôt until Marketplace eventually found the right long-term formula‚Äîthrough this and many other experiments‚Äîthat the company shifted its focus to growth.
	  
	  Successful innovators execute on lots of small experiments, and they have a patient, long-term approach to product and business success. It is rare, though not impossible, that innovation and short-term profits go together. Executed well, these kinds of small experiments help you understand your customers‚Äô needs and how your product might fit the market. Executed poorly, they can be worse than not experimenting at all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf6g6ar64swdt3t3tfbmtfe))
	- The key for the MVP is articulating, as succinctly as possible, what part or feature of your bigger vision needs to be validated or tested first (or next) and making the scope as closely limited to that feature as possible. This is the process of defining and measuring to hypothesis and quickly getting customer or real-world feedback on that test, then proceeding in as incremental or agile a manner as possible to the next test ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf6ht19m7zc987k5z50pkez))
	- A *platform* is a business model and capability that can be accessed and customized by external users. Often, these external users leverage this platform in ways you could never imagine, let alone sustain and serve. Amazon consists of more than a dozen thriving platform businesses, including AWS, Fulfillment, Payments, CreateSpace, Direct Publishing, Audible, Advertising, Flex, Instant Video, Kindle, and Mechanical Turk, to name a few. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7159x4c1v13cx0jky5b1v))
	- idea 18: Thinking about how your core capabilities could be offered as a platform might help you identify a future business strategy. It‚Äôs not for everyone. Regardless, deeply understanding what it would take will give you great ideas for improvement and innovation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf760t2f9expdy3pwettzs8))
	- What are some attributes of a platform business model? It abstracts complexity. It democratizes access and use. It has high fixed costs. It has low (zero) marginal costs. Its inventory is owned by others. It‚Äôs on demand. It features by-the-sip pricing. It has a network effect. It owns the means of connection. It is not the means of production. It features user-generated content and *other people‚Äôs work* (OPW) (see Idea 23). It is marketplace enabled. It has level and clear rules. It is programmable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf76g70af2pppzhkdwvspt4))
	- idea 19: Centralized IT serves one set of purposes for an enterprise. As more connected experiences are integrated into your products and services and more technology-enabled innovation is needed throughout, put technology resources closer to customers, and embed these into the business, where they are part of the team and product.
	  
	  The command-and-control mindset, which includes the common belief that ‚Äúmy CIO is going to manage my technology operations *and* deliver digital transformation‚Äù is yesterday‚Äôs management model and mindset. As your products and services become more digital, you need to develop a balanced understanding of what functions and decisions should be owned by the CIO (aka centralized IT) and what should be built at the edges of the business with technology capabilities built and operated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7jtqqmprkyn7bqyscsq0w))
	- WHAT REMAINS CENTRAL
	  
	  Before we shotgun the IT department to the furthest reaches of your organization, let‚Äôs touch on aspects of IT that likely should remain centralized: systems, standards, and operations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7k677fhckch29wy65pdnh))
	- First, certain systems and technology teams‚Äîespecially those with high legal and investor obligations, operating infrastructure for all technology teams, and ‚Äúorder-to-cash‚Äù systems‚Äîshould remain centralized. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7kp9q5f63gpytjbj9z1rm))
	- Typical applications and capabilities to consider centralizing in your IT organization include financial systems; systems owned by key support organizations such as finance, HR, and legal; systems with highly sensitive customer data (personally identifiable information, or PII); key infrastructure such as the data center, cloud, database, and messaging systems; employee and vendor enablement; integrated deployment environments; office productivity applications and desktop and/or device support; and perimeter and cyber threat detection technology. The operations central IT might continue to provide include operations to all the systems above, a program management office for large programs, and key vendor management operations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7mekj7z5qnhd7345tqyqk))
	- Second, it‚Äôs important to point out that the shift to decentralized technology capability does not mean that everybody does things in different ways. In fact, *standards become even more important, perhaps vital, in a decentralized model*. If we can create standards and principles under which every team deploys and operates, this will greatly enhance the speed, interoperability, and quality our teams will produce. As a result, the shift to decentralized IT will mean that the mission of central IT will grow in its ability to lead by influence through standards. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7n14zd6kb4yz94x9xanfq))
	- What types of standards are needed? Standards for system design; metrics and SLAs, APIs, and interoperability; technical documentation; tool and programming language; security (see Idea 36); program management including risk and program governance; quality, testing and release management; and support and operations, availability, performance, and graceful failure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7nvn43ezcs1rdh6x3hzrd))
	- First, technology that is part of products or core services can be distributed to these teams. Second, marketing, sales, and supply chain systems are great candidates to be integrated into their respective business organizations. These organizations need to have greater ownership over integrating technology and data into their processes and capabilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7qf3j1v7wzj3waf35z6nh))
	- When it comes to Amazon‚Äôs famous Two-Pizza Teams, most people miss the point. It‚Äôs not about the team‚Äôs size. It‚Äôs about the team‚Äôs autonomy, accountability, and entrepreneurial mindset. The Two-Pizza Team is about equipping a small team within an organization to operate independently and with agility ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf7r520q8fab5ae35ksy5rx))
	- As established in Idea 13, bureaucracy is a killer to innovation. What‚Äôs more, high-performing employees are not attracted to companies or divisions in which they cannot make a difference. Small teams truly own something‚Äîa product or feature, a service like the checkout cart, or a process like the warehouse receive process. Each team defines its business plan, metrics, and product road map. This drives motivation and continuous improvement while providing transparency and accountability for future investment and results. Each team has a keen sense of customers, even if they are internal customers, and the most important orientation is to gain adoption and provide value to these customers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf88m5nrz8cjsxvzxb2c08f))
	- idea 20: Organize the digitization of core capabilities and services to be owned by small teams. This team will engineer, build, and operate a capability valued by both internal and external customers. Creating small teams results in more innovation, higher-quality work, and a stronger culture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf893mahjamkjht9kk91wwr))
	- Two-Pizza Teams are organized around capabilities and services as opposed to projects. Work is expected to continue for more than two years at a minimum, and it is improved through iteration. There are hundreds of Two-Pizza Teams at Amazon today. Many are very technical in nature, owning underlying technology services powering the business. Some are more functional, bringing together and integrating other technical services to fulfill a business objective. An example of this type of team might be the promotions team or the image team. These teams build a world-class and configurable capability that business units can use in their business. Amazon does not create all teams as Two-Pizza Teams, but it does strive to break up organizations into well-defined, mission-oriented teams. Be fixed on the vision and flexible on model to serve your needs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf8a6y1xkewzeectarx03yy))
	- First, the business owner is the leader of the team. For a technology pizza team, the programmers become the customers and the implementers; they are both writing the spec and implementing it. The team is composed only of A+ people. At Amazon, this is enforced indirectly through the Bar Raisers Award (see Idea 43).
	  
	  The Two-Pizza Team is autonomous. Interaction with other teams is limited, and when it does occur, it is well documented, and interfaces are clearly defined. It owns and is responsible for every aspect of its systems. One of the primary goals is to lower the communications overhead in organizations, including the number of meetings, coordination points, planning, testing, or releases. Teams that are more independent move faster. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf8behg481t4140z8b4pq5w))
	- The Two-Pizza Team owns its own data. No other team may access or change the data except through APIs. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are the interfaces with enforced rules allowing other teams to integrate and use the team‚Äôs capability ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbf8c490myjtc9ywd9jr4wj7))
	- So how in the world does this work for teams outside the umbrella of the parent organization? Like their Two-Pizza Team compatriots inside the organization, Amazon‚Äôs external Two-Pizza Teams are tied together by a continuous measurement and reporting system whereby each team‚Äôs real-time results are accessible throughout the organization. Transparency and dedication to metrics drive the same internal culture of innovation and speed to the external teams. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbfbawjmq9bqvq86x23qgnr9))
	- Team effectiveness can be measured by a *fitness function*, which measures the impact of the teams‚Äô work‚Äîthat is, their input. The fitness function is intended to be a set of long-term metrics that measures the impact and effectiveness of the technology and/or function. It is a rigorous process to get a fitness function agreed to, and it happens well after a Two-Pizza Team is formed. It is ultimately measured in terms of customer impact and shareholder‚Äôs value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbfbc0nr6v6h8dq09w9e8ven))
	- idea 21: For most companies and teams, ‚Äúbecoming digital‚Äù requires change at all levels: strategy, business models, teams, partners, and others. Do not let your past positions be a limiting factor in what the right strategy is going forward. Things change. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbfbgdfskn9vdnykwwgp8hka))
	- Amazon and Jeff Bezos have flip-flopped on many long-held positions and strategies without batting an eyelash. ‚ÄúAdvertising is the price you pay for a mediocre product,‚Äù Bezos said at the 2009 shareholders meeting.[1](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch21fn-1) For the first couple of decades of its existence, Amazon spent essentially nothing on TV or print advertising, and the marketing budget went to fund free shipping.

	- Many great companies have landed in the gutter by guzzling their own dogmatic Kool-Aid. It‚Äôs easy to mistake strategy with core competence. Times change and situations change, so strategies need to change, and management better be willing to change along as well. Be very careful that your options are not limited by the commitments you make because the ability to change can mean the difference between survival or extinction for your organization.

	- While Amazon‚Äôs endless trail of disruption is always good clickbait, the Amazon effect is really just operational excellence. Sure, Amazon profoundly affects industries, but the true force behind its success is its incredible selection, great pricing, fast delivery, trustworthiness, no-hassle return, and warranty. How does Amazon deliver those intangibles every day, to 99.9 percent of customers, at an incredible scale of categories and geography? It‚Äôs relentless.

	- David said he believes that being digital is largely the ‚Äúrelentless pursuit of reducing inefficiencies.‚Äù *Inefficiencies* is not a euphemism for cost-cutting and layoffs. It can refer to quality issues, cycle times, and customer contacts and problems, among others. These are opportunities to innovate by using data to solve problems that affect customers, worker safety, competitiveness, and profitability.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbfgmx5sxzdmqsqzc0z2nwe1))
	- Many of the ideas outlined in this book are forcing functions. For example, having deep conversations on metrics with a team up front allows a leader to pay a little less attention to the team because she or he knows the team is measuring for the right results. Forcing functions must be done early and designed strategically, and accompanied by open and consistent communication. Let the team know ‚Äúthis is a forcing function.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbfgn95b08xzyrwr1exfjxsv))

	- We put a forcing function in place using a *future press release* (Idea 45). The future press release stated that ‚Äúa third-party seller, in the middle of the night without talking to anyone, would be able to register, list an item, fulfill an order, and delight a customer as though Amazon the retailer had received the order.‚Äù This simple sentence imposed a tremendous amount of integration and operations coordination between Amazon Marketplace and our sellers. And we needed to scale this to tens of thousands of sellers without adding that many employees at Amazon. It had to be done in a self-service manner. This forcing function did its intended job. We devised tools, processes, metrics, and monitoring to enable sellers to launch and operate their business at Amazon with surprisingly little support from Amazon. Yet we knew and the seller knew whether they were serving customers in the quality manner Amazon demanded. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbfgqzrtf9vnefpres03ggha))

	- At Amazon, having a balanced, well-engineered scorecard of metrics that is consistently reviewed day over day, week over week, provides deep insights into what works and what doesn‚Äôt. It also places sole responsibility for success and failure on you as a leader.
	  
	  Repeatable, consistent performance reflected in metrics is the gold standard for success. Without access to a consistent set of metrics, an Amazon leader would be flying blind, and such risky behavior is not acceptable at the company. Real-time metrics are the lifeblood flowing through the veins of Amazon. Real data and real insights from the customer experience are used continually to answer the question, ‚ÄúDid my customers have a good day today?‚Äù If your metrics are in place, if they are in real time, and your team members and processes use them, this question yields a simple yes or no answer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtn4mhwwjay95pj9tfbecrs))
	- It takes foresight to lead by the numbers correctly. You must embed real-time metrics from the very start of a program because they are nearly impossible to retrofit. The Amazon experience shows us that the single biggest opportunity for companies operating today is to completely rethink their concept of metrics ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtn6vqm01tk5yd2pdd9fazn))
	- SPEND MORE TIME DESIGNING YOUR METRICS
	  
	  Think about where time is allocated at a company at the executive and management levels‚Äîlots of time spent on budgeting, financial reviews, HR, and compliance, and so on. These are important. But do they really help serve customers, drive operational excellence, or spark ideas for innovation? Here are three quick steps for designing your metrics:
	  
	  **1.**¬†¬†¬†Spend time talking about what your metrics should be.
	  
	  **2.**¬†¬†¬†Have meetings that use those metrics to constantly review your business. Always look for root causes. Turn metrics to action.
	  
	  **3.**¬†¬†¬†Get as granular and real-time data as possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtn7f8k2ezqryfzj92rfnhb))
		- **Note**: Create personal metrics to measure your success.
	- Although they are called ‚Äúmetrics meetings,‚Äù they are really meetings of shared accountability where the ‚Äúowners‚Äù of related metrics discuss the most recent trends and issues in their metrics. Leaders are expected to know the details of their business, to be vocally self-critical, and to discuss plans or progress for improvement. Although successes might be recognized, the general modus operandi is to ‚Äúcelebrate for a nanosecond‚Äù and then focus on the issues and errors in the business. Even when things are generally good, they‚Äôre never perfect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtn9qs7s10tz4q92fhzmyfa))
	- Once a team‚Äôs metrics and SLAs are in place, the focus turns to data collection that will inform those metrics and SLAs. At Amazon, there are very specific standards for the quality and type of data a team should collect. Amazon‚Äôs executive team refers to those standards as ‚Äúinstrumentation.‚Äù
	  
	  Expectations on data collection‚Äîor instrumentation‚Äîat Amazon are twofold: First, data should be fine-grained in nature. You can always summarize and aggregate data, but you can‚Äôt go back and derive more detail from a data set. Second, that data should be available in real time. You can always batch data or slow it down, but you can‚Äôt speed it up. Design for no time lags and no batch systems.
	  
	  There are many reasons this is important. Let‚Äôs say a grocery company uses a refrigerated storage bin to keep its fruits and vegetables fresh. Suddenly, over the course of a day, all the lettuce goes bad. If the company has been collecting fine-grained data‚Äîfor example, any changes in temperature or pressure and their time stamps‚Äîthat grocery company might actually be able to figure out what it was that caused the lettuce to go bad. Otherwise, they‚Äôre stuck wondering about the possible variables and causes in that situation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtnbvmqpew2af0cbrby7ywg))
	- Finally, never stop reevaluating and building metrics. Frequently check to make sure that your metrics are still explicitly linked to goals, and don‚Äôt hesitate to change metrics when they stop driving change in your organization.
	  
	  Why?
	  
	  Because good metrics create good processes that minimize bureaucracy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtncdnkwd24mg02e08ftxsn))

	- The third leadership principle of Amazon is ‚ÄúInvent and Simplify.‚Äù Most find it curious that ‚Äúsimplify‚Äù shares the top billing with ‚Äúinvent‚Äù and is not buried somewhere in the description of the leadership principle. Operational leaders at Amazon think about how to scale core capabilities, knowing that keeping processes simple is the key to being able to scale them. I cannot overstate the importance of keeping it simple ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtnfgh2jdhn9gg0dvtfqech))
	- At its most basic, the ability to scale results in the production of more ‚Äúunits‚Äù through your process, on a declining cost per unit. Whether your unit is an order, a customer, or a byte, being able to ‚Äúdo more on a declining unit cost‚Äù helps you figure out how to scale the process without always just adding more people to it. These types of core processes could be services that help drive the online customer experience, such as the payments service or the image service, or they could be key back office capabilities like the inventory forecasting process or the server procurement process. These are essential capabilities that need to be world-class for the business and customer experience to excel. Not everything in the business needs to be as wired or world-class, just the essential processes differentiating your business ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtngg5brzhjnp3gjs2ne1fa))
	- idea 32: Well-defined processes help prevent bureaucracy or expose it if it exists. Build your core processes in a deliberate way as a key enabler of scale. Part of designing your processes is identifying the key services that are used in multiple ways across the enterprise. Force simplicity to triumph over complexity. Have high standards for building and operating key processes to prevent bureaucracy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtnjevn94125fde15xkqakb))
	- Having high standards and paying attention to detail to avoid these symptoms and driving accountability and world-class capability may sound unreasonable‚Äîand it is. This is the type of unreasonable expectation that Amazon has for its leaders. It is also one of the reasons Amazon is not a great place to work for many people because they will be exposed if they don‚Äôt live up to the high standards. Bureaucracy lets underperformers hide, and that‚Äôs why they like it. In his 2017 letter to shareholders, Bezos explained the benefits of high standards:
	  
	  Building a culture of high standards is well worth the effort, and there are many benefits. Naturally and most obviously, you‚Äôre going to build better products and services for customers‚Äîthis would be reason enough! Perhaps a little less obvious: people are drawn to high standards‚Äîthey help with recruiting and retention. More subtle: a culture of high standards is protective of all the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù but crucial work that goes on in every company. I‚Äôm talking about the work that no one sees. The work that gets done when no one is watching. In a high-standards culture, doing that work well is its own reward‚Äîit‚Äôs part of what it means to be a professional. And finally, high standards are fun! Once you‚Äôve tasted high standards, there‚Äôs no going back.[1](private://read/01h9v9w58hamd8ch34fj6gthqh#ch32fn-1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtnpy5wbvpmwgznd41cbz4b))
	- **1.**¬†¬†¬†**The process CEO:** A process has a leader‚Äîcall the person a ‚Äúprocess CEO.‚Äù This person is responsible for building a world-class capability. This does not mean that this person runs the process in all locations. For example, the ‚Äúinventory receive process‚Äù is a critical fulfillment center process. The ‚Äúprocess CEO‚Äù does not run the inventory receive process in the hundreds of Amazon fulfillment centers, but he or she delivers a world-class capability that is used by every fulfillment center.

	- **3.**¬†¬†¬†**Customers:** Customers are both internal and, as Amazon‚Äôs platform strategy shows, external.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtnsa7rgv7nkdmx9xe2jr4b))
	- **4.**¬†¬†¬†**Self-service:** A process should be self-service. Someone using or wanting to use your process should be able to discover, contract, implement, manage, and optimize utilizing your service without talking to you. This is a forcing function to force teams to define and explain their process. For more about forcing functions, see Idea 24. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtnsb6yhcvsd75p58bs7311))
	- **5.**¬†¬†¬†**Definition:** Create a deep, written definition of your process, with emphasis on the connections and interfaces. Think of the process as a black box. While not understanding the details of what goes on in the black box, define exactly what the inputs to the box are, the outputs the box delivers, and then the metrics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtnsdck9m2vjwqmwn8cw656))
	- **6.**¬†¬†¬†**Metrics:** This includes daily and operational metrics, as well as longer-term metrics. Long-term metrics were sometimes referred to collectively as a ‚Äúfitness function‚Äù at Amazon. A fitness function, which is a set of metrics, showed how a process or capability was delivered over a long time period. Metrics on adoption, scaling, cost, and quality were the key topics carefully debated and approved before a fitness function could be approved.

	- **7.**¬†¬†¬†**Application programming interfaces (APIs):** Part of making your capability self-service, APIs are the programming interfaces that allow other systems to integrate into your capability. APIs interface with the upstream and downstream business partners and systems, and they define the choreography and business rules between processes and capabilities. Designing these interfaces is a key part of the process engineering that a team does, and as such it is a core business concern.

	- **8.**¬†¬†¬†**Road map of possibilities:** A process has a road map of potential innovations and improvements for the capability. This road map is always updated and added to as part of an ongoing conversation with the team and partners on potential new ideas and features. This is not the approved or funded road map but, rather, a list of cataloged ideas to keep the team thinking about the future and getting them to write down these ideas. Making it a habit to critically ask questions about how to scale key capabilities, how to improve your operating metrics, and how to increase quality and writing these ideas down will enable you to develop better ideas over time. When a detailed and committed plan is needed, you will be ready with the best ideas because you have already been putting in the hard work, which cannot be rushed.

	- If you‚Äôre struggling to understand how to measure and improve your business processes, this is a great way to start:
	  
	  **2.**¬†¬†¬†Pick a key process or customer experience. (In the preceding example, the process was the number of jobs a technician could complete in a day.)
	  
	  **2.**¬†¬†¬†Define the hierarchy of metrics. (What are the factors that affect that process?)
	  
	  **3.**¬†¬†¬†Build a formula from the variables.
