- Frequent and rapid testing provides information for these feedback loops, answering questions such as: #[[ðŸ“¥inbox]] #sharing
	 - How valuable is what weâ€™ve built?    
Who else might use this and in what ways?    
How easy is it to understand and use?    
What have we broken along the way?    
What else does it do that we didnâ€™t anticipate?
