- Notes
	 - Planning fallacies tends to occur for large complex projects or plans where they are prone to complications. We are overoptimistic about our own skills, overconfident about our knowledge and overestimate work and project timelines.

	 - We may also have an illusion of control over facets of the projects where we have little or no influence.

	 - We may also not account for possible unplanned work to spring up

	 - We may employ [[agile]] methodology to address all these examples of overconfidence by reducing the cost of failure by utilizing a shorter [[sprints]] cadence
		 - While we can address our shortcomings, any unaddressed examples of overestimation or overconfidence can be mitigated and buffered by failing on a shorter timeline

		 - The cost of our overconfidence can be reduced with [[agile]] methodology
