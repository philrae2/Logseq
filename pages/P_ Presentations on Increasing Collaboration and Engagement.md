	 - Meetings
		 - Every capability meeting all teams are involved vs targeted meetings

		 - Run-down of integration tickets 
			 - Call out blockers and impediments

			 - Should this be a weekly basis or bi-weekly basis
				 - weekly to promote constant feedback

			 - How can this be improved?
				 - If the other teams were more engaged and share their timelines with us

				 - this could be done through e-mails but the teams are not responsive.

			 - Is there an alternative solution that can get the same results?
				 - 

		 - Creating presentations that tie user front facing development with capability integrations. (end to end of a functionality)

	 - Document to track agreements and reasoning
		 - Purpose: Periodically refer to this document to make sure everyone is in alignment
			 - Example: Integrations - are NOT real time data transfers, frequency is once a day or delay time between receiving information before action can be taken

		 - Document can also provide reasoning for actions and decisions made
			 - How to implement in the future?

		 - At the end of every sprint - add version updates

	 - To implement in the future:
		 - Tracking Document

		 - Templated sign-off document

		 - Work on simple decision trees checklist for e-mails and meetings
