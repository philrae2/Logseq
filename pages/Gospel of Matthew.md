title: Gospel of Matthew
---

- Chapter 1
	 - The genealogy of Jesus starts out this book signifying a significance for the author and the culture of that time. 
		 - A sermon I heard in the past, told of the genealogy highlighted Jesus was born from imperfect and some non-Israel people, dispelling any preconceived notions that Jesus was born from "pure blooded", noble, and holier persons.

	 - Jesus was born out of humanity. Jesus became worthless relative to what he originally had when he was a God.
		 - What exactly did he lose and how much of himself did he leave behind?
			 - What did Jesus gain when he came to this "world" to save us?

			 - Was there any other way, other than to die? Is the law so inflexible that it requires blood and death?
				 - "And you shall declare his name to be Jesus, for he will save his people from their sin."

	 - The birth of Jesus was prophesied earlier in the Old Testament: "And all of this has occurred in order that there might be fulfilled what the Lord spoke through the prophet, saying, "See: The virgin shall conceive in her womb and shall bear a son, and they shall declare his name to be Emmanuel" -- which, being interpreted, means "God with us."
		 - God is with us even though we haven't done anything to deserve it. God graces us with His presence through Jesus without any merits on our part.

		 - To behave as if we can compel God's presence through perfect obedience of the law portrays the opposite of God's character.

- Chapter 2
	 - The Magis were the Zoroastrian priestly caste of the Persians and Medes, not even of Jewish decent who know more of Jesus's birth than the Jewish priests themselves.
		 - Do outsiders know more about God now, than the people who claim to know him?

	 - God visits both the Magis and Joseph and Mary to warn them of Herod's plans to kill baby Jesus.

	 - Jesus' birth ended in bloodshed for the baby boys in Bethlehem. 
		 - How many babies died? 

		 - There is no historical record of this event?

		 - Other people (Mary, Joseph, and the Magis were guided and saved by God, while other innocent babies suffered)

		 - Life on earth isn't "fair" as humanity describes fair to be

		 - God's actions or seeming inaction is His wisdom and not ours
			 - We pray that we remain faithful and trusting in all times (good and bad) in our lives

- Chapter 3 - Jesus is baptized
	 - John the Baptist's message the people was to "Change your hearts, for the Kingdom of Heaven has drawn near"
		 - Thought to be the main content of Jesus's preaching in the Gospel of Matthew, the "kingdom of heaven" described **"a process, a course of events,** whereby God begins to govern or to act as king or Lord, an action, therefore, by which God manifests his being-God in the world of men."

		 - Jesus will be born soon, to show humanity how to live.

	 - 8. Bear fruit worthy of a change of heart

	 - 11...he will baptize you in a Holy Spirit and fire;
		 - We usually connotate fire with [[hell]], but here it is used to imply spiritual cleansing

- Chapter 4 - Jesus is tested in the wilderness
	 - 4...The human being shall not live upon bread alone, but upon every utterance issuing from the mouth of God.

	 - You shall make obeisance to the Lord your God and him only shall you adore.

- Chapter 5
	 - So let your light shine out before humanity, so that they may see your good works and may glorify your Father in the heavens.
