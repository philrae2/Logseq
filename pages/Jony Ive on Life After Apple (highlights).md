	- “Obsessive,” Ive calls himself, half joking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpbsxb7c71rj8ccpcx1djw1))
	- “In a world where we focus on screens and pixels but still need physical objects, he is fascinated by materials and cares a lot how people use things.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpbwmk9aw0x942p76499m6d))
	- One surprising thing about Ive’s approach is that conversation, rather than sketches, is how he often begins a project. Thinking—and then speaking about that thinking—is the raw material he works with. “Language is so powerful,” Ive says. “If [I say] I’m going to design a chair, think how dangerous that is. Because you’ve just said *chair*, you’ve just said no to a thousand ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpbxgpmjb3ecjwms4yb13yg))
	- “This is where it gets exciting,” he says. “You have an idea—which is unproven and isn’t resolved, since a resolved idea is a product—and the only tangible thing about the idea are the problems. When someone says it’s not possible, and all you are being shown is why it’s not possible, you have to think and behave in a different way. [You have to say], from a place of courage, I believe it is possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpbzapwxmzj1zpd007ac9ng))
	- “I wanted to be a part of this crazy California company,” Ive says now. *Corporation* is a word he reviles. “A group of people who are truly united in a shared sense of purpose” is what he prefers, and that’s initially what he hoped to find at Apple. Instead, soon after he joined, the company began to drift. The Newton tablet he designed in 1992 was praised by critics but largely ignored by consumers. Apple started to atrophy into an acquisition target. “The most important lessons you would never choose to learn because they are so painful,” Ive says. “The death of a company is so ugly.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpc9343ce1yhg7ec2bwak6w))
	- Ive’s role in the revival of Apple can’t be overstated, says current CEO Tim Cook, who was at the company during this era. Soon Ive’s control extended beyond the design studio into operations and production. Always a perfectionist, Ive traveled to Apple factories in Taiwan, China, South Korea and Singapore, sometimes sleeping on the line to ensure the precision he brought to one\-off samples had been captured in the final product. In 2001, Ive helped launch the iPod with its trademark white headphones, and later the ultra\-slender MacBook Air (2008) and iPad (2010).

	- When I look at Jony’s contribution to Apple, it’s not one product. It’s the culture that he built—the process that he developed that Apple now uses. Interesting things come from the pursuit of perfection.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpceyzw9zr9zyh6fnsnzf2t))
	- One of the first employees hired by Ive was a full\-time writer. (There are now more than 30 employees, many of whom worked with him at Apple.) Ive says LoveFrom is the only creative practice he knows of to have an on\-staff scribe whose job is, in part, to help conjure into words the ideas that his team of graphic designers, architects, sound engineers and industrial designers come up with for its collaborations with [Airbnb](https://archive.ph/o/19aD2/https://www.wsj.com/market\-data/quotes/ABNB), Ferrari and others.

	- “I think people think of design as how something looks. But that’s a superficial definition—it’s how something works,” says Airbnb co\-founder Brian Chesky ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpcn387mn9fy31t6rtxshf4))
	- Ive is quick to look ahead. “Success is the enemy of curiosity,” he says. And for Ive, curiosity has taken on an almost moral or religious quality. “I am terrified and disgusted when people are absolutely without curiosity,” he says. “It’s at the root of so much social dysfunction and conflict…. Part of why I get so furious when people dismiss creativity is that [when] it’s an activity practiced in its most noble and collaborative form, it means a bunch of people who come together in an empathic and selfless way. What I have come to realize is that the process of creating with large groups of people is really hard and is also unbelievably powerful.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpcr54bg77yh7kf8k4ga7tk))
