	- **I need to internalize this stuff and one way to do that is by doing a bunch of practice problems** and we're going to do a little bit of that assuming that we we get there um but uh in order to have uh a decent experience during those practice problems in order to make good use of time I also need to just have internalized the core terms The Core Concepts the ways that they relate to each other the properties of things notations there's a lot of notation in
	  
	  this book I can see already just by glancing at it um and I don't want to be in a position where like I'm looking at these these problems uh and trying to just like figure out what does this what does this variable mean so anyway we're going to be using this memory system stuff as I go uh and and the idea is that **I'm going to be writing little tasks for myself as we read that try to transform the knowledge in the book into tasks that make me retrieve or use or do something with that knowledge so that I internalize it**
	  
	  more effectively and **I'll I will practice those tasks as I read to make sure before I go too far a few pages** Beyond a new idea that I have indeed internalized it but I'll also be curingthese tasks with me in subsequent weeks so that ideally you know if we talk about the content of this chapter in a month um I will still be able to talk about it confidently ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h56ryrzschn9yxwkb27j5q9q))

	- One thing I often do when I'm reading this I think multiple passes and I pull stuff out if it's unfamiliar that I can tell that I'm going to need only like a second pass ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h56twxr1x0w0zfc2x4vppena))
	- I havea clearer picture now of of what I thinkis important or what the author seems tothink is important and now I cannotconform a better opinion about what'sneeded ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h56txd0z2trs6d5aeh92wsbp))

	- I don't understand these correspondenceswell enough to like make practiceproblems out of them or anything likethat so at the moment I'm kind of justnoting them and I'll see how they seehow they evolve in the text I do want tojust go ahead and memorize the theSchrodinger equation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h58jrhh3zy1tqheqj5mfjt9x))
	- I'm going to writemyself a little questionumokay just just about like this bookthinks it's very important the analogybetween the two yeah and I I want togive myself a chance to internalize thatyeah I don't totally understand it yetbut by writing a question about itum I'm giving myself the opportunity toreturn to this question in the future uh
	  
	  and maybe my understanding will bebetter and I'll have new and differentanswers and I'll probably revise thequestion or like split it into a bunchof different questions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h58jz83tdfytdpjtqyf1k2p1))
