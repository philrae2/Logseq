	- The author is trying to sell creating [[sprints]] for big problems. #agile
		- Are sprints a good [[Decision Making]] model?
			- Does the sprint process remove the necessity of using a decision making model?
	- **Steps for a five day sprint**
		- Monday - Map out the problem and pick a focus
			- Allow for more experts to join Monday in your [[sprint team]] to help define the problem
				- Ask [[how might we]] type questions
					- How might we improve the on-boarding process
			- [[Z: Create maps that are customer centric]]
				- Have the actors on the left
				- The "end" on the right
				- Keep the map simple (no more than 20 steps)
				- Ask for help to make sure the map is correct
				- [[Z: Solve the surface first]]
					- Answer and work on the surface level or higher level issues before investing too much time on unneeded details of the deeper issues
					- [[prioritize]] your problems first
				- Generate [[sprint]] questions
					- [[Z: Form questions and answers that will expose assumptions and biases]]
						- Example: Q: To reach new customers, what has to be true? A:  Will Customers trust our expertise?
					- What question do we want to answer in this sprint?
					- What has to be true to meet our end goal?
					- What might the future look like, what has to happen to accommodate our [[vision]] of the [[future]].
				- [[When working on a project, do so with the end in mind]]
					- Define what the end product should be and ask your team questions based on what the end vision is
						- Example: "More patients enrolled in clinical trials"
					- Set [[long-term goals ]] #[[goal setting]]
					- Apply [[Decision Making]] models
					- [[P: Applying mental models to decision making]]
			- Find a target for your sprint from your notes/maps
				- Who is the most critical customer and what is the critical moment for their experience

		- Explain the benefits and tradeoffs
			- Show the meetings and priorities that will be missed due to the sprint
