- **Note:**
	 - Humility in our decision making and judgement can help us identify the weaknesses in our arguments and support. Acknowledgement of our strengths and weaknesses can also motivate us to reach out to others who are experts in the areas we are lacking.

	 - We should invite others to break down our thinking to further refine and strengthen our thinking. 

	 - We should seek to make our options, thinking, and analyses more [[antifragile]] through [[collaboration]].
