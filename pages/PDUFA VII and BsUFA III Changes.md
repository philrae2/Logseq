	 - Section P - Allergenic Extract Products
		 - FDA will use fee revenues to support the review of new allergenic extract products that have been incorporated in the PDUFA program by PDUFA VII. Allergenic extract products licensed after October 1, 2022 will generally be included in user fees. Allergenic extract products licensed before October 1, 2022, and standardized allergenic extract products submitted pursuant to a notification to the applicant from the Secretary regarding the existence of a potency test that measures the allergenic activity of an allergenic extract product licensed by the applicant before October 1, 2022 will remain excluded from PDUFA. All performance goals, procedures, and commitments in this letter apply to the allergenic products included in the PDUFA program under PDUFA VII.
