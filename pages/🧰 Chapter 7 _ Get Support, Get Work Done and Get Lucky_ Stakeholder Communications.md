- [[90% of a project manager's work is communication]]
	 - ((998ef368-8c12-454c-8215-55f48e82c626))
		 - It is good to know the context in which tools were developed. This helps us get an idea of how to best use them.

			 - For instance, there is an oft-used adage in project management which says, "90% of a project manager's work is communication."
				 - This is true for full-time project managers. They focus on the work of project management, while the rest of the project team executes the project work: the work packages in the WBS[*](((3030e9f6-de72-49b3-bc22-c03687be3949))). To get the work done, project managers communicate: they understand their team, motivate them, and orchestrate the project work for them.

				 - Project managers also communicate with stakeholders outside the team. For instance, project managers never stop selling the project, from initiation to closing. They need to win support from sponsors, understand customer needs, and frame project outcomes to achieve project success, both in fact and in perception.

	 - When I started doing projects outside of large companiesâ€”in my own business or for volunteer projectsâ€”project communications management was still useful. Your role in managing stakeholders is the same, whether your team is large or small, whether these stakeholders be your boss, your customers or your students.
		 - Outside corporate tech, my project teams were just a handful of people. Sometimes it was just me. In this case, my manager self was orchestrating project work for my maker self. I found it helpful to separate the project manager and the doer of work packages. I share how I do both in Roam in [[ðŸ§° Chapter 12: Project-driven Stallion\Rider Productivity]].

- Stakeholder Analysis
	 - The first step in any good communication is to understand the perspectives of the people we wish to communicate to. In a project, we communicate to stakeholders, and we understand their perspectives through Stakeholder Analysis.
		 - **Stakeholders are anyone positively or negatively affected by the project.** This includes your project team, your customers, your project sponsor, people in related projects, or the community surrounding your project.

		 - The simplest way to do Stakeholder Analysis is to create a table with the following columns:
			 - Stakeholder

			 - Interests (the value they expect from the project)

			 - Influence (what you need from them to do the project well)

		 - Here are some more sophisticated ways of doing Stakeholder Analysis:
			 - [Empathy map](https://medium.com/the-xplane-collection/updated-empathy-map-canvas-46df22df3c8a) (You can do a web search for the latter two. There are many resources exploring those.)

			 - Customer personas

			 - Value proposition canvas

		 - [[Choosing a project management stack is a tradeoff between thoroughness and time.]] For Stakeholder Analysis, I usually go with the three-column table.

				 - [[Tip for Roam beginners]]: Roam features you need to know for this:
					 - Table ([here's a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHlz6RUleE))

					 - Shift-enter (line break in a block) is also helpful

				 - [[pro tip]]: open your WBS in the right sidebar to help you think about who your stakeholders are: anyone positively or negatively affected by the project

		 - Here's an example of stakeholder analysis plan: [Project RESOLVED Crowdfunding Stakeholder Analysis](((be56e7ae-b479-4b77-ae47-a66fce06d3f5))) (shift-right click to open in the right side-bar).

- The Communications Plan
	 - You now have a list of stakeholders, plus their interests in and influence on your project. The next step is to plan out communications, keeping in mind what they want out of the project, and what you need from them to get the project done.

	 - We will make use of another table. Here are its columns:
		 - Message (__what__ will you communicate?)

		 - Medium (__how__ will you communicate the message?)

		 - Schedule (__when__ will you do the communication - both timing and frequency?)

		 - Owner (__who__ will deliver the message?)

	 - The output of the communications plan are communications tasks with owners and due dates. Add these tasks as work packages in your WBS.

		 - Create your communications plan.

				 - Notice that there could be multiple message for each stakeholder and multiple media for each message.

				 - This example does not include the communications owner column since they are all owned by one person

		 - Add the communications tasks you created as work packages in [your WBS](((de4955b2-951b-476c-8b82-f69034814483))). It is up to you how to structure this. One straightforward way is to just place them under a communications branch.

	 - You have to weigh whether it is worth training your teammates in a new communication or collaboration medium. It might be better to understand what they currently use and base your communications plan on those ingrained habits.
		 - This may mean sending the same message to multiple channels, which is usually worth the additional time an effort.

- [[working with the garage door open]]
	 - One of the key tactics for increasing luck is to work with the garage door open. We will talk about a lot of other tactics in [[ðŸ§° Chapter 9 | Designing Serendipity: How to Systematically Get Lucky]]. In **working with the garage door open**, communications is key.
		 - To systematically increase good luck through communications, we first answer the following:
			 - Which communities would be most interested in this project?
id:: 70cfa11c-d1e1-4c6c-9bc2-49706c660225

			 - Who are the individuals who have outsized influence in the domain I'm operating in?
id:: 66c0e669-b6e4-46e3-8b4f-7523cd796f9c

		 - Then we can go through Stakeholder Analysis and Communications Planning for these answers.
			 - Sharing your work with communities is akin to content creation and inbound marketing.
				 - The hidden story behind the success of [[Project Accessible Genomics]] are the [Twitter threads](https://scrapbox.io/kahlil/Genomics_Twitter_Threads) I made about bringing genomics it to the developing world. Instead of merely taking notes on the journal articles I read, I created threads on them. These got me followers who were also interested in frugal science and genomics.

			 - Sharing your work with influential individuals is akin to outbound sales.
				 - The hidden story behind [this hidden story](((388bd5ee-13d8-40c8-9415-d3d2d099d62c))) is the hundreds of direct messages I sent to the scientists who followed me. Most of them ignored me, but projects like Accessible Genomics just needs a few true believers. __Luckily__, there were a few of them.

		 - Update your Stakeholder Analysis and Communications Plan tables with these stakeholders.

	 - The minimum requirement for project success is to avoid failure. Avoiding failure means identifying and responding to project risks. We will learn how to do this in the next chapter: [[ðŸ§° Chapter 8 | How to Not Fail: The RBS and The Risk Register]]
