		- How can we employ the Socratic Method into our decision making processes?

	- The Socratic Method is a cooperative, argumentative process of asking questions to expose flawed logic, establish first principles, and generate creative, imaginative solutions to complex problems.
		- The Socratic Method is a process of asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and expose and vet underlying assumptions and logic.
		- It is a strategy f or establishing first principles (the basic, foundational truths) in a problem solving process or discussion.
		- The Socratic Method in Practice
			- The Socratic Method is dynamic, but typically follows a general four step structure:
				- Start with open-ended questions.
				- Propose ideas based on these questions.
				- Probe these ideas with progressive questioning.
				- Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the best ideas are developed.
			- Questions and recommended actions:
				- Challenge the assumptions underlying the original thinking. Why do you believe this to be true? How do you know it‚Äôs true? How would you know if you were wrong? Identify the source of beliefs on a problem. Be ruthless in evaluating their integrity and validity.
				- Evaluate the evidence used to support the thinking. What concrete evidence do I have? How credible is it? What ‚Äúhidden evidence‚Äù may exist?
				- Evaluate the potential alternatives. What alternative beliefs or viewpoints might exist? Why might they be superior? Why do others believe them to be true? What do they know that I don‚Äôt? Evaluate them on their merits and ask these same fundamental questions about them.
				- After zooming in, zoom out. What was my original thinking? Was it correct? If not, where did I err? What conclusions can I draw from the process about systemic errors in my thinking?
				- The Socratic Method can be a powerful unlock for ambitious teams. Question base assumptions, ask ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù incessantly, and expose flawed logic to uncover better hypotheses.
		- The Socratic Method is a mainstay of legal and medical education curriculums, but has been forgotten in most other fields. Most programs favor lecturing - it‚Äôs easier. Few encourage targeted, rigorous questioning or environments of productive discomfort for the professor and students.
	- Humans are born innately curious but as we grow older we are told to stop asking questions and accept the way things are. We are told to stop exploring and assume that people know the answers to our questions.
		- This results in atrophied, unimaginative, and linear critical thinking skills.
	- Children ask questions in order to develop a deeper understanding of their existence and surroundings. The world is fascinating. Everything is so new to a child.
		- They ask questions in an effort o dive deeper, think critically, and establish first principles. And it works!
		- Children often asks why, which is a critical process for first order thinking.
	- As we grow to adulthood our curiosity slowly dies away. We begin to rely on heuristics and decision making razors or worse defer decision making and judgments to others.
		- However when we are tasked with problem solving in complex edge cases where creativity is required, using heuristics can lead to unimaginative linear solutions that closely resemble what has been done before.
