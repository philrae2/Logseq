	- The Relationship Between Work and the American Dream
	  
	  Transcript:
	  Speaker 2
	  Yeah, it's interesting because as you were talking about privilege, I do think that even people who don't come from privilege to see work as a means to achieving the American dream. Right? It's not necessarily the dream job, but it's providing for your family, sending your kids to college, putting them on a better path than you'd been on. So it does bridge a lot of socioeconomic strategy.
	  
	  Speaker 1
	  Yeah, definitely. And I think even just the conception of a job as a calling or a vocation or an identity is something that helps obfuscate the fact that a job, first and foremost, is an economic relationship. That is an exchange of time and labor for a paycheck. And I was talking to one academic and research for the book. And they were telling me how part of the reason why this affliction is so prevalent here in the United States is because so many workers really identify with the ownership class. They don't actually see themselves as workers. They see themselves as one break away from being a millionaire or being the boss. And therefore, the sort of voting habits and lack of collective organizing is the result of thinking that, oh, I'm not a worker working in solidarity with other workers across the economy. I am just one lucky break away from being the boss. ([TimeÂ 0:10:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/75868892-cbbb-4291-bdd0-c1c1844f7eb5))
