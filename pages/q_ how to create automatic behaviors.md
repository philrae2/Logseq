- Create a checklist or process list:
	 - We can use our knowledge of biases and our types of thinking: [[System 1 and System 2 Thinking]] and create automatic behavioral triggers and processes 
		 - When we are ((cd1a3e6f-5246-4ca9-91c2-8837a36dffbf)) look for experts to help and make sure to validate your information. Be humble and skeptical of how much you really know. 

		 - Don't be married to a specific outcome. Be openminded to other possibilities.

	 - When in a meeting and making decisions:
		 - Take stock of your emotions. Be in the correct mood, focused, and undistracted when executing tasks that require intense focus.
			 - What are your biases and judgments with the people whom you're working with? Have a positive outlook of them, get rid of your biases. Start with a blank slate.

		 - Make sure everyone agrees to the same definition of the problem

		 - Promote equal voice. A decision is only as good or correct as the information it's based on. Everyone should feel they can freely contribute.
			 - Take stock of everyone's needs and that they are, at minimum heard and acknowledged, if not met.

		 - When in the presence of a group be careful of groupthink. Try to tease out disagreements, when everyone agrees too quickly without justification.

		 - Have a skeptical mind when an "expert" or authority figure is making decisions or giving out recommendations. Don't defer to their authority blindly. Make sure that the decision is sound and based on the correct framework or the most current information.

	 - Create opportunities for deliberate practice of goal motivated behaviors

		 - We can use the act of writing to make our thinking tangible and manipulatable to improve both our thinking and writing. By creating plentiful opportunities to practice deliberate writing, we can improve our writing skills. 
			 - Deliberate and intentional note taking is one opportunity to provide us practice with writing and thinking. Instead of lazily and mindlessly copying the ideas we consume, we can take an active role in our reading. Critically assess the information we consume whether it lines up with the truth or observations of reality.

	 - Create Triggers for next action steps
		 - When we create goals we also need to create a corresponding plan to enact our goals. A goal is not a plan, and the goal is useless without one. A trigger to start the next step or first step of the plan is helpful to get started. We can also think of creating automatic behaviors based on those triggers to fuel our forward momentum towards our goal. 

	 - Revisit and re-evaluate your practices and proceses
		 - Constantly reanalyze and assess the value of your processes. Are thy productive or unproductive?
