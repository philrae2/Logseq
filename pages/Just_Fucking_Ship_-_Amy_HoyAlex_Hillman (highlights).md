	- But so often we, the creators, get so wrapped up in making
	  that we forget to ask the most important questions of all:
	  – What do these people like?
	  – What do they need?
	  – What would be the worst ﬁt for them?
	  – What drives them crazy?
	  – What, metaphorically, makes their airways close up? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwsxanedqe52nkf8pq6wr9j))
	- And when we don’t ask these questions, we end up making:
	  – products nobody wants
	  – products that just don’t ﬁt your audience
	  – products that offend/repel the very people you want to
	  attract
	  – products so wide-ranging and vague that they almost
	  seem… suspicious ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwsxfpvere5qhmhc7my534b))
	- Remember: Your customers aren’t Everyone.
	  Your customers are bedeviled by speciﬁc problems. They have
	  things to get done, things they need & want to achieve. They
	  have tools they already use, and others they hate. They prefer
	  video… or they prefer to read. They like self-serve… or they
	  like hand-holding. They want to DIY, they love hard work, they
	  want to know everything… or just want to pay to make the
	  problem go away. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwsy1kxacvgjpfq61rpaz23))
	- Don’t tell them “Get rid of Excel forever!” when they actually
	  love Excel. Don’t offer to take away all their pain — like magic!
	  — when they’re controlling, by-the-numbers folks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwt3cxvp916e1ajwt1hafmx))
	- Always focus on the customer. Your customer.
	  Learn what they need & want. Learn what they hate, what
	  makes them sick, what they never value enough to pay for.
	  Learn what they do buy.
	  Apply it to your paid products and your free stuff, too — from
	  blog posts to apps to books to conferences.
	  That’s how you craft a menu (and a product) that will appeal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwt3qy7937vy1627c0j8df2))
	- Set a deadline… and mean it
	  “Hey, I’m having a dinner party. Wanna come? When? Oh,
	  probably next week. Maybe Thursday. Whenever I get done.”
	  Yep… that’s a nonstarter. It’s a nonstarter for products, too.
	  Your guests — your customers — need to know when to show
	  up.
	  You need to know when you’ll be done. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwt418crerpbq8t7d5jszz1))
	- A cut-off date is good for everyone.
	  Product launches require anticipation, and anticipation
	  requires a date & time. And you can’t launch what you haven’t
	  ﬁnished.
	  So pick a deadline. And mean it.
	  Even if you don’t hit it dead on perfect — and it may take a
	  while to get good at this — you’ll have made signiﬁcant
	  progress, simply by taking it seriously. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwt4k67g646aer50ns2kr1s))
	- That’s the power of a backwards plan
	  The same approach applies to your book, your app, your
	  workshop, your conference… whatever creative thing you’re
	  about to undertake.
	  Like for the dinner party, you ﬁrst have to know what Done™
	  looks like — you’ve got to set your “menu” in advance (more
	  on that later). Then you have your deadline (from our previous
	  chapter).
	  It’s time to put on your planning cap and draw your
	  roadmap… in reverse. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwtf02zsvs2jwvqc8eh8v28))
	- Questions to ask for your
	  backwards plan
	  When you sit down to make your backwards plan, you have to
	  ﬁgure out what you have to ﬁgure out. Nope, not even
	  kidding.
	  These questions are the place to start:
	  – What’s the end result look like, exactly?
	  – How many chapters/videos/features?
	  – What is absolutely required, what’s nice to have?
	  – How perfect does it have to be?
	  – How long will each of these take?
	  – What has to come ﬁrst?
	  – What do I need to prepare?
	  – How long will that take?
	  – What do I need to ﬁnd out?
	  – How long will that take?
	  – How much, or how little, deﬁnes success? And who
	  controls that? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwtkwb1b6rs6ayssgrbpkpc))
	- Take a hint and break it down
	  When you’re working on your backwards plan, break it into
	  separate components — the dishes, if you will, for your dinner
	  party. Whether it’s sections, chapters, lessons, individual
	  features a single blog post, or a small set of bug ﬁxes… Break
	  it into stages. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwtmnh0n0nxezzsje8103mx))
	- Sidebar: One thing can mean a lot of things
	  A component may not be as obvious as cranberry sauce vs
	  gravy. With creative work, our components are often stages of
	  what appears to be “the same” thing:
	  – ﬁrst outline, then write
	  – ﬁrst write, then edit
	  – tests ﬁrst, then reload, then more tests, then reload
	  – a ﬁrst iteration, then a second iteration
	  32 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwtnvpvdar36eftck55k6pb))
	- – a design draft, then a revision
	  When you work in discrete stages and take credit for each
	  stage, huge projects will seem a lot less daunting.
	  Processes can be components, too. A launch is a
	  component: there’s a strategy, the content, the timing… and
	  you can build and even ship a product without having built
	  the launch component (more on which later).
	  This book is only being laid out professionally when I’m
	  done writing it.
	  So keep your eyes peeled for “hidden” components. And
	  break ‘em down. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwtp0wd8yxra8rc4g9cb6s8))
	- You need to get speciﬁc
	  You need to know what you're going to make in speciﬁc detail
	  so that you can go shopping, get all the right ingredients, plan
	  your attack, start it with enough time til dinner, etc. You need
	  to ﬁgure out what skills it demands, so you can know if it’s
	  something you can achieve.
	  Everybody knows this. They ask, “What’s for dinner?” and
	  “What are you in the mood for?” And recipes have difﬁculty
	  settings and the activities listed right there.
	  And yet, how many times have you heard someone say, “I’m
	  writing a Book About X”?
	  Even given the most modest and boring topic in the world,
	  you could go on for hundreds and hundreds… and
	  hundreds… and hundreds… of pages.
	  Charles Darwin wrote a 673-page book on barnacles. And
	  that was just volume 1! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwtq39rv1ex3a20kvw996p5))
	- The solution? Get crispy.
	  Crispy is the opposite of soggy. Crispy is speciﬁc, vivid,
	  detailed. Crispy things have hard edges and that’s how you
	  know when you’re done.
	  When you deﬁne a crispy problem, you can come up with a
	  crispy solution.
	  Crispy products are easier to start and easier to ﬁnish, and
	  much, much easier to sell.
	  DON’T write a a book “about consulting.” DO focus on a
	  speciﬁc, crispy problem: Double Your Freelancing Rate, or Get
	  Clients Now.
	  DON’T promise that "you'll learn CSS.” DO offer, "How to
	  use the new ﬂexbox module to get exactly the layout you
	  want."
	  DON’T call your app “user friendly.” DO explain that your
	  new customer could "Log time with 4 key strokes."
	  DON’T set out to create “a project management app” or “an
	  email marketing tool” — there are a million of those…
	  DO Consider Your Guest ﬁrst and foremost, and solve a
	  speciﬁc problem they have, to their taste. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwtrd20sh5p436f168j48n8))
	- Start small ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwts8s86krk7060yj8k4qev))
	- So start small, and easy
	  Don’t start with the product equivalent of a 7-course meal. Or
	  a 3-course. Stick to one course: one main dish, and maybe a
	  side if you’re feeling ambitious. Get it right. Get a win under
	  your belt.
	  Don’t set out to write a book on day 1. Write blog posts,
	  instead. Answer questions. Share your knowledge in crispy
	  bits. If your blog posts turn out well, you can roll them into
	  your future book at any time. You don’t lose a thing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwtsqpgxrpg5k814zpw9294))
	- Don’t set out to build a huge web app on day 1. Write about
	  the problem space. Do drawings. Create a small library.
	  Create & ship a single feature app (like a micro-site). You’ll
	  learn a lot about what it’s like to work with complete
	  independence, and if you play your cards right, even your
	  writing and your single-feature app could be very useful to
	  your future users. You can always roll it into a bigger app later.
	  You don’t lose a thing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwtsvhrmv5arem2hv471hg4))
	- Start on the atoms, not on the
	  edges ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwtt70rspsbdmmdw8173m36))
	- You have to write before you can edit; you have to code
	  before you can compile. Yes, I’m Captain Obvious, but there is
	  an order to things.
	  When there’s more than one place you could start, where
	  should you choose?
	  Start with the small things you can ﬁnish, now. Start with
	  things that will move you forward towards your goal of
	  shipping, both tactically and emotionally.
	  You’ve already broken your work apart into components,
	  right? And each component into still smaller bits of work,
	  right?
	  You did that so you could identify & pick the smallest units
	  of work that will move you forward to that next, slightly bigger
	  step in your backwards plan.
	  Start with those little things that you can ﬁnish. Start with
	  atoms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwttkcf8y2d84x10yfhgw1p))
	- An atom can be ﬁnished, used & reused ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwttr0dypnf1fd8egbyp7vh))
	- Start with the tiny little things you can ﬁnish, and especially
	  those you can use to make bigger things, and make you feel
	  good about making actual forward motion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwtvcbg0h0dvtgv0nzyvamz))
	- Track your progress ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwv8n7gcjx47rtt1vgzfd1k))
	- You can make your work tangible. Create milestones. Give
	  yourself the joy of watching the progress bar move, of saying
	  “Hey! I ﬁnished something!”, even when it doesn’t feel like it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwv95295ww5fp98c3qkyr2d))
	- Always consider the customer
	  Remember — your job isn’t to just “make a thing the bestest” —
	  it’s to just fucking ship, because the goal is to get your project
	  or product into the hands of someone who will use it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwvv4ss3w19ws89ymyr14yw))
	- If a thing doesn’t help or even impact the customer, does it
	  matter? Should it be done?
	  If a developer creates a brand new ecommerce platform,
	  does it sell more software? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwvvekyp5ythz5r1e06k260))
	- You’ve got enough to do already
	  Makers make, right? Why wouldn’t you do everything exactly
	  the way you’ve dreamt it?
	  Simple: You’ve got enough work on your plate already.
	  The product itself? Plenty of work. Loads. Always more than
	  you imagine when you start.
	  It’s the product that gives value to your customers, not the
	  little details around it.
	  Think of those “little details” as their own projects.
	  Exponentially increasing your risk of never ﬁnishing at all.
	  Don’t be afraid to shop off the shelf ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwvwx1he8b73vhwzwagpyx4))
	- When the component isn’t part of the core value your
	  customer needs, use the best available thing. Good enough,
	  shipped, is far better than perfect, not shipped. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grwvxtaspg0byzv0dfea73ze))
