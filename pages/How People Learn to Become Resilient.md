- Resiliency is developed through how we view our challenges. If we hold a strong internal focus and believe we have the ability to shape the outcomes of our environment we become more antifragile. However, if we cede control to external factors we control, we grow less resilient. It is us, not our circumstances that control our achievements.

- Resilient people are autonomous and independent, they seek out new experiences, and have a positive social orientation.

- Resilience can be broken if the stressors are too overwhelming.

- One central element of resiliency is the perception of our experiences. We can see "negative" events as traumatic or we can see them as opportunities for growth and learning. 
	 - Traumatic events are only predictive of negative outcomes if we see them as negative experiences.
