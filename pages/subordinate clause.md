- Type:: #definition

- Definition:
	 - n English grammar, a __subordinate clause__ is a group of words that has both a [subject](https://www.thoughtco.com/subject-grammar-1692150) and a [verb](https://www.thoughtco.com/verb-definition-1692592) but (unlike an [independent clause](https://www.thoughtco.com/independent-clause-grammar-1691159)) cannot stand alone as a [sentence](https://www.thoughtco.com/sentence-grammar-1692087). Also known as a [__dependent clause__](https://www.thoughtco.com/dependent-clause-grammar-1690437). Contrast this with a [main clause](https://www.thoughtco.com/main-clause-grammar-term-1691584) and [coordinate clause](https://www.thoughtco.com/coordinate-clause-grammar-1689804).

	 - Subordinate clauses are usually attached to main clauses or embedded in [matrix clauses](https://www.thoughtco.com/matrix-clause-grammar-1691371).

- Examples and Observations
	 - "__Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority,__ it is time to pause and reflect."(Mark Twain)

	 - "That spring, __when I had a great deal of potential and no money at all__, I took a job as a janitor."(James Alan McPherson, "Gold Coast," 1969)

	 - "Memory is deceptive __because it is colored by today's events__."(Albert Einstein)

	 - "Bailey and I did arithmetic at a mature level __because of our work in the store__, and we read well __because in Stamps there wasn't anything else to do__."

	 - (Maya Angelou, __I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings__, 1969)

	 - "__If you can't leave in a taxi__ you can leave in a huff. __If that's too soon__, you can leave in a minute and a huff.

	 - (Groucho Marx, __Duck Soup__)

	 - "__If a free society cannot help the many who are poor,__ it cannot save the few __who are rich__."(John F. Kennedy)

	 - "__When you lose your laugh,__ you lose your footing."(Ken Kesey)

	 - "Every book is a children's book __if the kid can read__."(Mitch Hedberg)

- Grammatical Juniors
	 - "Subordinate clauses are 'grammatical juniors,' dependent on the main 
clause for complete sense. They are not subordinate in any other way; 
they need not be stylistically inferior, and indeed may be more 
informative than the main clause they depend on, as in this example:

	 - If you go on with a diet that consists exclusively of cottage cheese, dry toast, and Brazil nuts, I shall worry.

	 - The main clause is 'I shall worry': it is, I think, rather feeble in 
view of what precedes it, a sad anticlimax to what was promising to be a
 fairly arresting sentence. But although that previous clause is much 
more interesting in every other way, it remains grammatically 
subordinate: it could not stand on its own."
