	- Outsiders always assume consulting firms offer answers and recommendations. They usually don’t or, at least, should not. They analyze options and give the board the facts to make an informed decision. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087CK6ZLP&location=705))
	- “Luis, we are not here to check work that is obviously wrong. Andres and I are busy. I should have not roped in Andres unless I had heard you out, but you should not be sending documents to me unless they are airtight. My job is not to check things you know are not perfect. I don’t have the time,” added Gustavo. ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087CK6ZLP&location=735))
	- Luis knew Gustavo was right. They were both extremely busy. It was not good for anyone for these two senior leaders to be checking such basic things. A minute spent checking the reports, like an analyst, was a minute they could not spend on much more important issues. Luis should be seeking their feedback for things he could not possibly do on his own, nor with the support of his peers.

	- He knew that a business plan is always a set of assumptions since it is a plan for a business that does not exist. The assumptions and inputs are always speculation. The world’s most sophisticated financial models, built with AI, approved by all the bank’s experts, were still only models projecting what could happen. A sophisticated engine powered by the jet fuel of uncontested assumptions. ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087CK6ZLP&location=964))
	- Typically, a study would commence with a top-down analysis to check that the correct issues were being analyzed and to determine the size of the problem. Using that approach, Jim would have needed to conduct: Financial analyses (not financial modeling) Case studies Focus interviews Benchmarks and gap analyses ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087CK6ZLP&location=988))
	- Jim realized the first thing they needed to determine was if the new venture was profitable and/or created value. Only if it was profitable would they need to complete the full top-down analyses, followed by updating the financial model and finding opportunities for improvement. If the venture was not profitable, they would report this to the board in the first client update and the board would need to make a decision on whether or not to move from the pilot stage to full implementation. ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087CK6ZLP&location=992))
	- Jim could infer a lot from just observing everything around him. Too many consultants never did that. They ignored their judgment and the signals around them. They jumped to analyses when they did not know what to analyze. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087CK6ZLP&location=1378))
	- In a higher fixed cost (vs. higher variable cost) operation, a business usually needs lots of sales volume over which to spread the fixed costs. This implies lower pricing and/or margins to drive up sales and it usually means the business model is business to consumer. In this situation, you are likely to see a lot of sales traffic, like in a large supermarket. ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087CK6ZLP&location=1390))
	- On the other hand, a business with a higher fixed cost (vs. higher variable cost) operation could be selling lots of volume to a single large customer. Again, this could imply lower pricing and/or margins to drive up sales, but the business model is business to business, since the customer is a business. In this situation, you are likely to see less sales traffic, like the offices of a luxurious private bank branch.

	- diplomat always wants to solve the problems in a new country. That only creates resentment and hurts everyone in the long term. We should respect the local law enforcement and help them. We should make them better. If you do that, you will fail in the short term as a diplomat, but the host country will be better off in the long term. And that is the point of being a diplomat. ([Location 2341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087CK6ZLP&location=2341))
	- Using the traditional problem-solving approach requires executives to be reactive. This is both a costly and time-consuming approach to managing a business. It punishes shareholders, employees and the broader community. ([Location 3254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B087CK6ZLP&location=3254))
