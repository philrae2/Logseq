- **Note:**
	 - At OBI we are predominantly relying on measuring time, cost, and quality as key indicators of performance but they may not provide a wholistic picture.
		 - We should also take note and identify specific key performance indicators that are both qualitative and quantitative.(Example: Number of user stories delivered that were requested by the Product Owner)

		 - Keep  in mind lagging indicators and leading indicators. Lagging indicators measures performance. 

		 - Leading indicators measures progress and performance towards events. They help us ask how to produce our desired results
			 - They are sometimes described as inputs for example the percent of customers that sign up or use products. 

			 - They lead us to ask questions like what processes can we create to ensure success, what skills and talents we need, and steps to take for speeding up production.

		 - Lagging indicators measures current performance. They measure output that's already occurred to gain insights for building future success. (ex. profit, expenses, revenue, renewal rate)
