- **Types of notes:**
	- __Question notes__ express an open question.  (e .g. ,  “What is the effect of analogical distance of inspirations on creative output?”). They can be readily mapped to research questions in research projects.
	- __Synthesis notes__ articulate a single, generalized idea, such as a claim (e .g. , “Inspirations that are of intermediate distance from the problem domain strike the best balance between benefits for novelty and quality of ideas”). In some cases, a synthesis note can encapsulate a more complex single idea, such as a theory (e .g. , “Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection”), high-level argument (“Scientific observations are theory-laden”), or problem (e .g. , “The demarcation problem in philosophy of science”)
		- Synthesis notes can be mapped to citation statements in academic publications, which are typically generalized and drawing on more than a single source. They are also similar in flavor to “claims” in the 
		  micropublications model (Clark, Ciccarese, & Goble, 2014) (although it can encompass more complex things than a simple assertion), and “permanent notes” in the Zettelkasten method.
	- __Observation notes__ articulate a single, highly contextualized observation (e .g. , “the finches on the island had different colored beaks after two generations”). By contextualized, we mean that observation notes should tend towards being bounded in the particulars of time, authorship, and setting, as opposed to trying to describe a generalized claim that holds over an equivalence class (that is the function of synthesis notes).
		- The intuition is that observation notes should be as close to “the data” as possible. They should be similar to how results are described in results sections of academic publications. By convention, we write them in the past tense (to ground them in time), bind them to an assertor where possible (to ground them in the standpoint of the author), and tend towards lower levels of 
		  abstraction (to ground them in relevant particulars).
		- Observation notes can be mapped to “literature notes” in the Zettelkasten method, or “lines of evidence” in models of scholarly argumentation like the SEPIO model (Brush, Shefchek, & Haendel, 
		  2016)
	- __Context snippet notes__ capture (and optionally describe) contextual details that ground the observation note. Contextual detail is a broad term, but generally includes things like specific figures, data items, tables, or quotes that are the basis for observation, as well as metadata (e .g. , authors, year, publication) and methodological details that are important for understanding and evaluating an observation note.
		- As a practical matter, I’ve found it more useful to use screenshots as context snippets, rather than plain text grabs. I find that this gives me the freedom to be a bit more sloppy and inclusive in the context of the quote (vs. very precisely specifying something), easier handling of images/figures/tables, and forces me to redescribe the context snippet, which enhances comprehension and recall. I also don’t need to waste time fixing up text (OCR mistakes, formatting, etc.)!

- The process
	- Phase 1: Articulate Questions
	- Phase 2: Create observation notes from papers
	- Phase 3: Develop synthesis notes
	- Phase 4: Compose synthesis notes into arguments or theories
