- #[[Reference Notes]]
	- Chapter 1. Introduction
		- PRINCE2 has been designed to be generic so that it can be applied to any project regardless of project scale, type, organization, geography or culture. It achieves this by:
			- separating the management of project work from the specialist contributions, such as design or construction. The specialist aspects of any type of project are easily integrated with the PRINCE2 method and, used alongside PRINCE2, provide a secure overall framework for the project work focusing on describing what needs to be done, rather than prescribing how everything is done.
	- Chapter 2
		- 2.2. What is project management?
		- Project management is the planning, delegating, monitoring and control of all aspects of the project, and the motivation of those involved, to achieve the project objectives within the expected performance targets for time, cost, quality, scope, benefits and risk.
		- 2.3. What is it we wish to control?
			- There are six variables involved in any project, and therefore six aspects of project performance to be managed. These are:
				- Costs The project has to be affordable and, though we may start out with a particular budget in mind, there will be many factors which can lead to overspending and, perhaps, some opportunities to cut costs.
				- Timescales Closely linked to costs, and probably one of the questions project managers are most frequently asked, is: When will it be finished?
				- Quality Finishing on time and within budget is not much consolation if the result of the project does not work. In PRINCE2 terms, the project’s products must be fit for purpose.
				- Scope Exactly what will the project deliver? Without knowing it, the various parties involved in a project can very often be talking at cross-purposes about this. The customer may assume that, for instance, a fitted kitchen and/or bathroom is included in the price of the house, whereas the supplier views these as ‘extras’. On large-scale projects, scope definition is much more subtle and complex. ^^There must be agreement on the project’s scope and the project manager needs to have a sufficient understanding of what is and what is not within the scope. The project manager should take care not to deliver beyond the scope as this is a common source of delays, overspends and uncontrolled change (‘scope creep’)^^.
				- ^^**Benefits** Perhaps most often overlooked is the question: Why are we doing this? It is not enough to build the house successfully on time, within budget and to quality specifications if, in the end, we cannot sell or rent it at a profit or live in it happily. The project manager has to have a clear understanding of the purpose of the project as an investment and make sure that what the project delivers is c^^^^onsistent with achieving the desired return.^^
				- Risk All projects entail risks but exactly how much risk are we prepared to accept? Should we build the house near the site of a disused mine, which may be prone to subsidence? If we decide to go ahead, is there something we can do about the risk? Maybe insure against it, enhance (underpin) the house foundations or simply monitor with ongoing surveys?
		- 2.6. Applying PRINCE2
		- The traditional approach to measuring time, cost and quality may still have its place but it does not necessarily tell the whole story. ^^The best way to summarize the project status at a point in time is to identify key performance indicators^^ (KPIs)
		  id:: d84f74f2-9889-4d3d-a323-92c70ac00d26
		- 2.6. Applying PRINCE2
		- ^^When designing KPIs, a balance should be struck between qualitative and quantitative measures, leading and lagging indicators, and project inputs and outputs. The number of KPIs should be balanced to create only information that is necessary and sufficient.^^
		  id:: 09ca7ff0-b6f6-4c06-a486-b529328eba16
		- 2.6. Applying PRINCE2
			- Objectives are what the project needs to achieve, whereas KPIs are the measures that indicate whether or not progress is being made towards achieving the objectives
			  id:: 01f4d877-bf76-49ac-86e9-f5ad7e99176f
		- 2.6. Applying PRINCE2
			- Lagging indicators
			  id:: a2c4e2fa-ae85-46a0-aa08-78f897b4c04c
				- Measure performance that follows events, and allow management to track how well actual performance matches that which was expected. An example could be the number of unexpected errors reported after a particular software release.
				  id:: 71f0becc-23d5-4e5a-8750-5777e10fe604
		- 2.6. Applying PRINCE2
			- Leading indicators
			  id:: 59385811-a635-452e-bf61-74c3af20c607
				- Measure progress towards events, and allow management to track whether it is on course to achieve the expected performance. An example would be the persistent failure of a supplier to meet quality requirements early in the project.
				  id:: 16e030b4-d42a-40c1-a048-9aaa04036d43
		- 2.6. Applying PRINCE2
			- The KPIs should be aligned with the quality expectations and acceptance criteria defined in the project product description, and the project tolerances (time, cost, quality, scope, benefits and risk) defined in the PID.
			  id:: 6838ebf7-4614-439f-b340-2fa076b691e9
		- 2.6. Applying PRINCE2
			- One way to show project progress is through a project dashboard that uses graphical representations such as pie charts and histograms to display the status and trends of performance indicators. These can show the status for quantitative KPIs and are easy to understand by relevant stakeholders at all levels.
		- **Risk **All projects entail risks but exactly how much risk are we prepared to accept? Should we build the house near the site of a disused mine, which may be prone to subsidence? If we decide to go ahead, is there something we can do about the risk? Maybe insure against it, enhance (underpin) the house foundations or simply monitor with ongoing surveys?
	- Chapter 3 3.1. Continued business justification
		- PRINCE2 requires that for all projects:
		  id:: 2e34475d-da01-4d54-9608-1ff113096b90
			- there is a justifiable reason for starting the project
			  id:: aa456968-51e3-4a00-ad31-b6137975389d
			- that justification is recorded and approved
			  id:: bc76f97a-1a9d-44be-bcbb-d703da3390b2
			- the justification remains valid, and is revalidated, throughout the life of the project.
			  id:: 22f1c2b2-5e05-41a4-99ba-28bd93b91900
		- PRINCE2 project teams learn from experience: lessons are sought, recorded and acted upon throughout the life of the project.
		  id:: ac900db1-37c6-4ff4-83cf-e9adc509b125
			- When starting a project Previous or similar projects should be reviewed to see if lessons could be applied. If the project is a ‘first’ for the people within the organization, then it is even more important to learn from others and the project should consider seeking external experience.
			  id:: a4627769-7362-48c2-a2de-faa6843245a8
			- As the project progresses The project should continue to learn. Lessons should be included in relevant reports and reviews. The goal is to seek opportunities to implement improvements during the life of the project.
			  id:: 88070ba7-4b16-479e-a2a8-5289c15d2b92
			- As the project closes The project should pass on lessons. Unless lessons provoke change, they are only lessons identified (not learned).
			  id:: 1f36da13-12e2-422c-86db-cba913cd56ab
			- It is the responsibility of everyone involved with the project to look for lessons rather than wait for someone else to provide them.
		- Projects involve people. No amount of scheduling or control will help if the wrong people are involved, if the right people are not involved, or if people involved do not know what is expected of them or what to expect of others.
		  id:: 30b78a08-0cad-48b7-9b00-944c68ac38af
		- 3.3. Defined roles and responsibilities
			- To be successful, projects must have an explicit project management team structure consisting of defined and agreed roles and responsibilities for the people involved in the project and a means for effective communication between them.
			  id:: 3ceeb988-187b-4fd3-916e-a79ddf528321
		- Projects that focus on what the project needs to produce are generally more successful than projects whose primary focus is the work activity. This is because the purpose of a project is to fulfill stakeholder expectations in accordance with the business justification, and to do this there must be a common understanding of the products required and the quality expectations for them. 
		  id:: 32473b62-2da3-4835-aecb-da9f945bdf7f
			- The purpose of a project can be interpreted in many different ways unless there is an explicit understanding of the products to be produced and the criteria against which they will be individually approved.
		- This focus on products: ensures that the project only carries out work that directly contributes to the delivery of a product; that is, the project does no more work than it needs to deliver its agreed products helps manage uncontrolled change (‘scope creep’) by ensuring that all changes are agreed in terms of how they will impact project products and the business justification for the project reduces the risk of user dissatisfaction and acceptance disputes by agreeing, at the start, what will be produced by the project.
		  id:: 5c0bf45d-44c0-44b3-9a30-069f92c8dd65
			- A PRINCE2 project uses product descriptions to provide such clarity by defining each product’s purpose, composition, derivation, format, quality criteria and quality method. They provide the means to determine effort estimates, resource requirements, dependencies and activity schedules.
		- Using timeboxes/sprints in agile delivery enables fast detection of possible failure of products. This fail fast effect reduces waste of resources and can be a useful learning experience.
	- 4.3. Tailoring PRINCE2 to suit different projects
		- PRINCE2’s manage by exception principle should be implemented correctly and should be at the heart of empowering people to self-organize and stay in control. Tolerances are set around quality criteria so that everything that is delivered must be delivered to at least the minimum acceptable level of quality
		  id:: a06afbee-c11e-4863-95e2-e3b2c77916f9
		- Product descriptions (sometimes written as epics or user stories), quality criteria and quality tolerances can be prioritized and decomposed to provide flexibility in what is being delivered. This makes it easier to stay in control and focus on the delivery of value (or benefit) in a timely manner without compromising quality.
		- When the project is being sponsored by a number of separate organizations, ensure governance is unambiguously defined, especially with respect to who can make which decisions, how risk is allocated and what happens in the case of non-performance.
	- 4.4. Adopting PRINCE2 in an organizational environment
		- There are many models for managing change; however, at the heart of them all is gaining the support of the individuals who are required to change their way of working. This involves: understanding the current situation (current state) designing how the organization will work when the transformation is completed (future state) identifying what changes are needed to move from the current state to the future state developing the necessary capabilities to meet the organization’s needs (roles, processes, systems, behaviours) engaging those affected by the change and winning their support or, at least, consent.
		  id:: b86ec0c4-b0d0-4b2c-9c85-78eb54de6c1e
	- 6.1. The business case theme
		- It is a PRINCE2 principle that a project must have continued business justification. This requires that the business justification is not just developed at the beginning of the project, but that it is kept under regular review and updated in response to decisions and events that might impact the desirability, viability or achievability of the project
		  id:: d8214f38-e697-4bbc-bf60-b4f3c76d2fcd
			- To be following PRINCE2, a project must, as a minimum:create and maintain a business justification for the project; usually a business case (PRINCE2’s continued business justification principle)review and update the business justification in response to decisions and events that might impact desirability, viability or achievability of the project (PRINCE2’s continued business justification principle)define the management actions that will be put in place to ensure that the project’s outcomes are achieved and confirm that the project’s benefits are realized (PRINCE2’s continued business justification principle)define and document the roles and responsibilities for the business case and benefits management (PRINCE2’s defined roles and responsibilities principle).
			  id:: c7e41341-206a-4278-9210-79221d3f2d3a
			- PRINCE2 requires that two products are produced and maintained for the business case theme: Business case Provides the costs, benefits, expected dis-benefits, risks and timescales against which viability is justified and continuing viability is tested.  It is acceptable to use an alternative document such as a corporate business plan to replace the business case for part of the project lifecycle.
		- 6.2. PRINCE2’s requirements for the business case
			- The business case is at the centre of any impact assessment of risks, issues and changes by asking the question: How will this risk, issue or change affect the viability of the business case and the business objectives and benefits being sought?
			- Continued business justification drives all decision-making by ensuring that the business objectives and benefits being sought can be realized. The business justification must be reviewed and verified: at the end of the starting up a project process by the project board, to authorize project initiation based on a reasonable justification at the end of the initiating a project process by the project board, to authorize the project as part of any impact assessment by the project manager of any new or revised issues or risks in tandem with an exception plan by the project board, to authorize the revised management stage and the continuation of the project at the end of each management stage by the project manager, to determine whether any of the costs, timescales, risks or benefits need to be updated at the end of each management stage by the project board, to authorize the next management stage and the continuation of the project during the final management stage by the project manager, to assess the project’s performance against its requirements and the likelihood that the outcomes will provide the expected benefits as part of the benefits reviews (possibly by corporate, programme management or the customer), to determine the success of the project outcomes in realizing their benefits.
		- 6.3. Guidance for effective business case management
			- The link from the project’s outputs to outcomes and benefits needs to be clearly identified and made visible to those involved in the project, otherwise there is a danger that the original purpose of the project can get lost and benefits will not be realized
			  id:: 6d69e924-d978-43e3-91d1-a8576af800e2
			- When creating a business case, it is important to understand how incremental delivery of a product, and the value associated with it, could impact project viability (positively or negatively) and also the ability to achieve the early realization of some benefits. If there is a high level of uncertainty, the business case should be developed very quickly and the assumptions tested quickly.
			  id:: 0e28c873-fb66-4057-be66-bead6bd54a81
		- 6.4. Techniques: investment appraisal
			- Examples of investment appraisal techniques
				- Whole-life costs Analysing the total cost of implementation and any incremental transitional, operational and maintenance costs.
				- Net benefits Analysing the total value of the benefits less the cost of implementation, transition and ongoing operation, calculated over a defined period.
				- Return on investment (ROI) Profits or savings resulting from investments expressed as a percentage of the initial investment.
				- Payback period A calculation of the period of time required for the ROI to repay the sum of the original investment.
				- Discounted cash flow A means of expressing future benefits based on the current value of money. Sometimes discounted cash flows include risk adjustments as the business may not be confident that all the benefits will materialize.
				- Net present value The total value of discounted future cash inflows less the initial investment. For example, if the discount rate is 6 per cent, the value of money halves approximately every 12 years. If a project is forecasting a £500 000 benefit to materialize in year 12, then it is only worth £250 000 in today’s money.
	- 7.1. The organization theme
		- Every project needs effective direction, management, control and communication. Establishing an effective project management team structure and approach for communication at the beginning of a project, and maintaining these throughout the project’s life, are essential elements of a project’s success
		  id:: 93c56fe8-efeb-4b2e-bed7-f6040d0611ea
		- PRINCE2 identifies three principal categories of project stakeholders (business, user and supplier; see Figure 7.1), although there may be a wide range of other stakeholders with an interest in the project (e.g. government, regulator or unions). Each of the three principal categories of stakeholders has a specific interest in, or viewpoint on, the project, and each category of stakeholders also has specific roles on the project in order to ensure that their interests are met, as detailed below:
		  id:: 26744c1f-ff3e-4667-82ff-37ec7f1cd8c5
			- ^^Business^^ The products of the project should meet a business need that justifies the investment in the project. The project should also provide value for money. The business viewpoint therefore should be represented to ensure that these two prerequisites exist before a project commences and remain in existence throughout the project. PRINCE2 defines an executive role to represent business interests on the project.
			  id:: 5cbaf66d-1e44-45db-9f4f-02cf8da0a018
			- ^^User^^ PRINCE2 makes a distinction between the business interests and the requirements of those who will use the project’s outputs. The user viewpoint represents those individuals or groups for whom some or all of the following will apply: 
			  id:: 7777c077-ba4b-44d0-9b4d-ffffeffeb5d0
				- they will use the outputs of the project to realize the benefits
				  id:: b9fe269d-0a64-47d6-93f9-89b47b14717a
				- they will operate, maintain or support the project’s outputs
				  id:: 5c31d543-d853-4680-9c6a-463887dfe20f
				- the outputs of the project will impact th
				  id:: 17ccab45-1fd3-4ddd-a221-77400ccb7679
				- The user presence is needed to specify the desired outputs and ensure that the project delivers them through the supplier. PRINCE2 defines a senior user(s) role to represent user interests on the project.
				  id:: 96286011-cb99-4625-a4be-f7ffef0b2696
				- The senior user is responsible for specifying the needs of those (including operations and maintenance) who will use the project’s products for user liaison with the project management team and for monitoring that the solution will meet those needs within the constraints of the business case in terms of quality, functionality and ease of use.
				  id:: 8037f825-d9be-4577-a88a-4adc5c3d4f60
					- The role represents the interests of all those who will use the project’s products, those for whom the products will achieve an objective, or those who will use the products to deliver benefits. The senior user role commits user resources and monitors products against requirements. For the sake of effectiveness the role should not be split between too many people
					  id:: 9d3bff37-4b0d-42fc-b59a-9dab4ed7ae69
					- The senior user(s) specifies the benefits and is held to account by demonstrating to corporate, programme management or the customer that the forecasted benefits that were the basis of project approval are in fact realized. This is likely to involve a commitment beyond the end of the project’s life.
					  id:: 1cf88092-1df7-41d5-8204-e9572ad67232
					- If necessary, more than one person may be required to represent the users.
					  id:: c116261b-8ad7-47ef-a0b6-791aff2af6fb
			- ^^Supplier^^ The creation of the project’s outputs will need resources with certain skills. The supplier viewpoint should represent those who will provide the necessary skills and produce the project product. 
			  id:: 1dfdbe11-f5a2-442c-a9d1-b1b4e7db95c1
				- The supplier needs to have an understanding of all the relevant standards with which the output (product) needs to comply, and the project may need to use both in-house and external supplier teams to construct the project product. PRINCE2 defines a senior supplier(s) role to represent supplier interest on the project.
				  id:: 712d448a-afaf-4e88-97ec-a997e56778c0
				- In PRINCE2, the business, user and supplier interests are brought together on the project board, which is accountable for the success of the project 
				  id:: d15c406e-fd81-47c7-9668-d0af9e6470e6
		- To be following PRINCE2, a project must, as a minimum:
			- define its organization structure and roles.
				- This must minimally ensure that all of the responsibilities in PRINCE2’s role descriptions are fulfilled (PRINCE2’s defined roles and responsibilities principle) document the rules for delegating change authority responsibilities, if required define its approach to communicating and engaging with stakeholders.
			- PRINCE2 requires that two products are produced and maintained for the organization theme:
				- PID In the context of the organization theme, this provides the single source of reference for how the project is to be managed. The PID sets out the project management team structure and roles.
				- Communication management approach This describes the means and frequency of communication to stakeholders both internal and external to the project.
				- Both these products should be created during the initiating a project process.
		- All PRINCE2 projects must have a project board.
			- The project board has authority and responsibility for the project within the instructions (initially contained in the project mandate) set by corporate, programme management or the customer.
			- The roles and responsibilities of the project board are described in Appendix C, section C.1. They include:
				- being accountable for the success or failure of the project in terms of the business, user and supplier interests
				- providing unified direction to the project
				- delegating, using the PRINCE2 organizational structure and controls designed for this purpose
				- facilitating integration of the project management team with the functional units of the participating corporate, programme management or customer organizations
				- providing the resources and authorizing the funds necessary for the successful completion of the project
				- effective decision-making
				- providing visible and sustained support for the project manager
				- ensuring effective communication both within the project team and with external stakeholders
			- Although the project board is responsible for the project, the executive, supported by the senior user(s) and senior supplier(s), is ultimately accountable for the project’s success and is the key decision maker. The project board is not a democracy controlled by votes.
				- The executive’s role is to ensure that the project is focused throughout its life on achieving its objectives and delivering a product that will achieve the forecasted benefits. The executive has to ensure that the project gives value for money, ensuring a cost-conscious approach to the project, balancing the demands of the business, user and supplier.
				- The executive is appointed by corporate, programme management or the customer during the pre-project process of starting up a project. The role of the executive is vested in one individual, so that there is a single point of accountability for the project. The executive will then be responsible for designing and appointing the rest of the project management team, including the other members of the project board. If the project is part of a programme then corporate, programme management or the customer may appoint some or all of the project board members.
				- The executive secures funding for the project and is responsible for the business case and continued business justification of the project.
			- The project board is responsible, via its project assurance role, for monitoring all aspects of the project’s performance and products independently of the project manager.
				- Project board members are responsible for the aspects of the project assurance role aligned with their respective areas of concern (business, user or supplier). If they have sufficient time available, and the appropriate level of skills and knowledge, they may conduct their own project assurance tasks; otherwise they may appoint separate individuals to perform these.
				- Project support and project assurance roles must be kept separate in order to maintain the independence of project assurance
		- PRINCE2 allows the above roles to be combined within the following constraints:
			- the executive and project manager roles cannot be combined
			- there cannot be more than one executive or project manager
			- the executive’s accountability for project success cannot be delegated
			- the project board should not assign any project assurance roles to the project manager, team manager or project support.
		- 7.3. Guidance for effective project organization
			- What is a PMO?
				- This is a commonly used abbreviation for the office an organization may set up to provide support for its programmes and projects. It is variously called the programme management office, portfolio management office or project management office. It may also be viewed  Creating and analysing stakeholder profiles (Why and What?) Gaining an understanding of the influences, interests and attitudes of the stakeholders towards the project and the importance and power of each stakeholder. For instance, is a particular group likely to be negative, irrespective of the message, and therefore require particular care? Stakeholders’ influence and interests, whether rational or emotional, must all be taken into account. They have the potential to affect the success of the project. Perceptions may be mistaken, but they must be addressed. The stakeholders’ perceptions of the benefits should be quantified where possible.by progressive organizations as a centre of excellence.

			  id:: 2b395608-b1be-4089-85a2-4fc8ab68d3ef
				- **Defining the stakeholder engagement approach (How?)** Defining how the project can effectively engage with the stakeholders, including defining the responsibilities for communication and the key messages that need to be conveyed. For each interested party, agree the: 
				  id:: b95808e0-a766-4284-a8ff-c694d45af4c7
					- information the party needs from the project
					  id:: 579a3e53-5770-45ad-ae4c-1759eabfb3cc
					- information the party needs to provide to the project method, format and frequency of communication sender and recipient of the communication.
					  id:: b75842d9-0614-4a20-9de6-b01b0034511f
				- **Planning the engagements (When?)** Defining the methods and timings of the communications. These are best planned after defining how the project will engage with the different stakeholders. When selecting the senders of information, it is important to select communicators who have the respect and trust of the audience. Their position in the corporate, programme management or customer organization and expertise in the subject matter will greatly influence their credibility. Many projects have a formal commencement meeting to introduce the project and its aims to the corporate, programme management or customer organization. If this type of meeting is used, it is important that the members of the project board attend to show their support and commitment to the project
				  id:: 4016c68a-4de0-423b-92cc-f8fe28d49c06
			- **Measuring effectiveness (Results)** Checking the effectiveness of the engagements. Project assurance could be involved in checking all the key stakeholders, their information needs and that the most appropriate communication channels are covered.
	- 8.1. The quality theme
		- Quality is concerned with ensuring that the project’s products meet business expectations and enable the desired benefits to be realized.
		  id:: 258d2bd4-bbd0-4ef5-84a5-15a60cc52a6b
			- Underestimating or omitting quality management activities is likely to lead to slippages, overspends and/or poor quality results. The quality theme addresses the quality methods and responsibilities not only for the specification, development and approval of the project’s products, but also for the management of the project
			  id:: 0af75cb6-5ed6-420e-b85c-75ae447b7f08
			- PRINCE2’s focus on products principle is central to its approach to quality. PRINCE2 requires systematic activities to:
			  id:: e3d42d5a-b668-4a2e-b475-c98e246b7eb6
				- explicitly agree the customer’s quality expectations and acceptance criteria for the project product
				  id:: c767c616-649a-4a1c-bbf8-52d802682302
				- identify the project’s products (i.e. to the level at which the project intends to exert control)

				- define the project’s products in product descriptions including the quality criteria by which they will be assessed, the quality methods to be used in designing, developing and approving them, and the quality responsibilities of those involved
				  id:: 2e99633e-f3fa-4740-8620-dab109b05704
				- implement and track the quality methods employed throughout the project.
				  id:: 1fd15249-8400-4968-ac0e-8d8a175e2bb0
			- Definition: ^^Acceptance criteria^^
			  id:: e60efe9e-bf10-4443-b827-cd7491230b08
				- A prioritized list of criteria that the project product must meet before the customer will accept it (i.e. measurable definitions of the attributes required for the set of products to be acceptable to key stakeholders).
				  id:: 7f5e67f0-28b4-4eab-8fe8-96b3492561a3
				- PRINCE2 explicitly addresses the two activities of quality planning and quality control.
				  id:: fb415c2d-ea2b-4a7a-9b04-1186865f52b6
					- Quality planning is about defining the project’s products, with their respective quality criteria, quality methods (including effort required for quality control and product approval) and the quality responsibilities of those involved.
					  id:: 095981d1-9065-4a14-a433-6824a11a9bd8
					- The purpose of quality planning is to provide a secure basis:
					  id:: 7ec345d7-a853-414d-b64c-2ed66358be1c
						- to obtain agreement by the project board on the overall quality expectations, the products required with their associated quality criteria (including corporate and other standards to be observed), the means by which quality will be achieved and assessed and, ultimately, the acceptance criteria by which the project’s product will be judged
						  id:: fd8b5b1d-a5ac-4983-a985-51eb74aa773f
						- to communicate these agreements unambiguously so that all the project stakeholders have a common understanding of what the project is setting out to achieve for control (i.e. establishing an effective baseline for the project’s quality controls, including the quality tolerances) and a secure means of achieving products that are fit for purpose
						  id:: e8212cf0-bc89-49e4-b2ce-0a75d6f552d8
				- Identifying the acceptance methods is crucial because they address the question: How do we prove whether and when the project product has been completed and is it acceptable to the customer? This is particularly relevant in commercial customer/supplier arrangements, where acceptance criteria may be stated as part of a contractual agreement.
				  id:: c326090b-109a-4313-bda0-a7e11c6502a7
					- Where possible, the customer’s quality expectations should be prioritized as they will be used as inputs to define quality tolerances for the project’s products.
					  id:: d165e807-e636-4137-a4d4-2822e453880e
					- The customer’s quality expectations should be reviewed at the end of each management stage in case any external factors have changed them
					  id:: 481364dd-70da-4565-a31e-c3f1934db4b2
				- The project’s acceptance criteria form a list of measurable definitions of the attributes required for a set of products to be acceptable to key stakeholders. Examples are ease of use, ease of support, ease of maintenance, appearance, major functions, development costs, running costs, capacity, availability, reliability, security, accuracy and performance. When the project can demonstrate that all the acceptance criteria have been met (according to the priorities set), the project’s obligations are fulfilled and the project can be closed.
				- Quality criteria specified in product descriptions need to be both specific and measurable
				-
			- Quality assurance provides a check that the project’s direction and management are adequate for the nature of the project and that it complies with relevant corporate, programme management or customer standards and policies. Quality assurance is therefore independent of the project.
			  id:: 57a30fb6-d386-4001-9890-0f2c62be2838
			- Project assurance is the project board’s responsibility to assure itself that the project is being conducted correctly. The project board members each have a specific area of focus for project assurance, namely business assurance for the executive, user assurance for the senior user(s) and supplier assurance for the senior supplier(s). Project assurance is therefore independent of the project manager but not independent of the project.
			- ^^Quality register^^ A quality register is used to summarize all the quality management activities that are planned or have taken place, and provides information for the end stage reports and end project report
			  id:: e0a1f801-3c5f-467d-8779-23b06e2a6f05
				- The quality management approach should be created during the initiating a project process and reviewed, and possibly updated, at the end of each management stage. The quality management approach will define how and when the quality register is reviewed and updated.
				- The quality register is effectively a diary of the quality events planned and undertaken (e.g. workshops, reviews, inspections, testing, pilots, acceptance and audits). It is created during the initiating a project process as the products and quality control measures are being defined. It is then maintained (in line with the current baseline plans) throughout the project.
				  id:: a951d68e-b0f9-45e8-bc7c-d628b41f3404
				- As the project progresses and records of the quality activities are received, the quality register is updated to reflect (in summary form) the actual results from the quality activities. The quality register provides key audit and assurance information, relating what was planned and agreed (in the quality management approach and product descriptions) to the quality activities actually performed
				  id:: e0854a11-7eb8-49a7-b483-a3e787d789da
				- It is much easier and cheaper to correct quality issues and flaws early in the project lifecycle, rather than when the finished product is being tested or, worse, when the product is already in operational use.
				  id:: e99506a0-c6e1-40c5-8a66-ff567493b5a2
				- The customer’s quality expectations should be agreed early in the starting up a project process. The expectations are captured in discussions with the customer and then refined for inclusion in the project product description
				  id:: 36f06820-13bd-4f1f-b5d7-2c7319114bed
				- To avoid misinterpretations and inaccurate assumptions about the project’s quality requirements the customer’s quality expectations should cover:
					- the key quality requirements for the project product
					- any standards and processes that will need to be applied to achieve the specified quality requirements, including the extent to which the customer’s and/or supplier’s quality management system should be used
					- any measurements that may be useful to assess whether the project product meets the quality requirements (e.g. existing customer satisfaction measures).
					- The key quality requirements will drive the choice of solution and, in turn, influence the time, cost, scope, benefits and risk performance targets of the project.
				- The objectives of a PRINCE2 quality review are to:
				  id:: fd5c11c7-a0cc-407e-b68d-0192e80f7359
					- assess the conformity of a product against the quality criteria documented in the product description
					  id:: 000a601c-51e9-444e-aa1d-243d04a90453
					- involve key interested parties in checking the product’s quality and in promoting wider acceptance of the product
					  id:: 7b897aec-ad9f-4f15-9623-a72fa752c287
					- provide confirmation that the product is complete and ready for approval
					  id:: 9f8e3c5c-89fd-4966-86ae-8740b25e37c1
					- baseline the product for future change control
					  id:: 5f5e4425-3f17-4c81-b64a-a52e3df59f01
			- Product Descriptions:
				- Care should be taken to write product descriptions in sufficient detail but not in too much detail. Product descriptions that are too detailed can lead to an unnecessary increase in the cost of quality for the project, whereas incomplete or inaccurate product descriptions can lead to acceptance disputes if the delivered results do not match the customer’s expectations.
	- 9.1. The plans theme
		- Plans provide the backbone of the management information required for any project; without a plan there can be no control.
		- A plan enables the project team to understand:
		  id:: 45592b7a-e04f-45b7-a67f-be6d6fb4ec78
			- the risks; both opportunities and threats
			  id:: 801ddfb2-7787-47fd-a9c5-087de66c7c8c
			- any issues with the definition of scope
			  id:: 021913e9-343d-4591-8d36-55ccb99a4aad
			- which people, specialist equipment and resources are needed
			  id:: 4bf8ce5d-3d18-47dc-82c9-e3a45ed7d554
			- when activities and events should happen
			  id:: f75d1264-e751-4141-9e21-8f9632569682
			- whether targets (for time, cost, quality, scope, benefits and risk) are achievable.
			  id:: 67f3c249-8cdb-4c32-ad5c-d1e9d5887035
		- A PRINCE2 plan must describe not only timescales but also what will be delivered, how and by whom. Poorly planned projects cause frustration, waste and rework. It is therefore essential to allocate sufficient time for planning to take place
		  id:: 25a56b8a-c9f5-4dde-881b-7a60d9c84bd3
			- A detailed proposal for doing or achieving something which specifies the what, when, how and by whom it will be achieved. In PRINCE2 there are only the following types of plan: project plan, stage plan, team plan and exception plan
			  id:: 4d9d92ca-e467-4da6-b469-8694f92b9480
			- A plan provides a baseline against which progress can be measured and is the basis for securing support for the project, agreeing the scope and gaining commitment to provide the required resources.
			  id:: e13cf781-1820-4956-ac07-37eb43077774
			- PRINCE2 addresses the planning horizon issue by requiring that both high-level and detailed plans are created and maintained at the same time, reflecting the relative certainty and uncertainty on either side of the planning horizon. These are:
			  id:: 60dce76f-ada1-4de1-99cb-f210098e6118
				- a project plan for the project as a whole. This will usually be a high-level plan, providing indicative timescales, milestones, cost and resource requirements based on estimates
				  id:: 0306ca8f-5cd1-42b6-a6c2-11fa486f3839
					- A high-level plan showing the major products of the project, when they will be delivered and at what cost. An initial project plan is presented as part of the PID. This is revised as information on actual progress appears. It is a major control document for the project board to measure actual progress against expectations
					  id:: e65fb34a-b870-43f1-8a08-f3819615e3a2
				- a detailed stage plan for the current management stage, aligned with the overall project plan timescales. This plan is produced before the start of that stage, and must not extend beyond the planning horizon.
				  id:: 15e0bba4-c037-4cea-b4f9-521b3f24cc9d
			- PRINCE2 has a principle to focus on products. The philosophy behind this is that what needs to be delivered (the products) must be identified before deciding what activities, dependencies and resources are required to deliver those products. This approach is called product-based planning.
			  id:: c99d24e5-3ad7-41a6-8075-696880f1fffc
			- The benefits of product-based planning include:
			  id:: 009913eb-574c-43ea-a21c-287c14d1536a
				- clearly and consistently identifying and documenting the plan’s products and the interdependencies between them: this reduces the risk of important scope aspects being neglected or overlooked
				  id:: 4c9f2774-f140-44d3-b7f3-6c225de81f4e
				- removing any ambiguity over what the project is expected to produce
				  id:: ee4cdb28-35bc-4c68-9dec-15f08a41196a
				- involving users in specifying the product requirements, thus increasing buy-in and reducing approval disputes
				  id:: b962a312-a1dd-4aa5-9ccb-4aec7e3576f1
				- improving communication: the product breakdown structure and product flow diagram provide simple and powerful means of sharing and discussing options for the scope and approach to be adopted for the project
				  id:: e6118275-44ad-4385-8b39-b37cfe36308e
				- clarifying the scope boundary: defining products that are in and out of the scope for the plan and providing a foundation for change control, thus avoiding uncontrolled change or ‘scope creep’
				  id:: d055dec1-9b19-4602-bc4f-7fc0bad88308
				- identifying products that are external to the plan’s scope but are necessary for it to proceed, and allocating them to other projects or organizations
				  id:: 8e4baabe-c9c1-4245-8f85-d618fec0d2b3
				- preparing the way for the production of work packages for suppliers
				  id:: f32501f6-cf2c-42e0-a5cb-97a7e518acd8
				- gaining a clear agreement on production, review and approval responsibilities
				  id:: 54194ba7-8ef1-45dd-8162-53edecddeead
		- PRINCE2 requires that four products are produced and maintained:
		  id:: 1bece312-7e02-4e51-b6cf-df54294754f0
			- ^^Project product description^^ A description of the overall project’s output, including the customer’s quality expectations, together with the acceptance criteria and acceptance methods for the project. As such it applies to a project plan only.
			  id:: 057fc076-25ae-4178-8ccb-4a08a1c6f8f5
				- The project product description defines what the customer is expecting the project to deliver and the project approach defines the solution or method to be used by the supplier to create the project product. Every effort should be made to make the project product description as complete as possible at the outset. See Appendix A, section A.21, for the suggested composition of the project product description.
				  id:: 9afc63da-2fea-4c41-a97c-cced3bcc23fe
				- Writing a project product description
				  id:: dbe762ba-0885-4128-8f69-1f6500f81355
					- The project product description is created in the starting up a project process as part of the initial scoping activity. It may be refined during the initiating a project process when creating the project plan. It is subject to formal change control and should be checked at management stage boundaries (during the managing a stage boundary process) to see if any changes are required. It is used in the closing a project process as part of the verification that the project has delivered what was expected of it and that the acceptance criteria have been met.
					  id:: f0fd3a39-ecb0-486a-abfa-7b2354929aa5
				- Although the senior user is responsible for specifying the project product, in practice the project product description is often written by the project manager in consultation with the senior user and executive. The project product description is included as a component of the project brief and is used to help select the project approach defined within the project brief. The project product description defines what the customer is expecting the project to deliver and the project approach defines the solution or method to be used by the supplier to create the project product.
				  id:: 03fe150f-3e75-4940-8cec-e6462514c550
					- Every effort should be made to make the project product description as complete as possible at the outset. See Appendix A, section A.21, for the suggested composition of the project product description.
					  id:: ca4e6bcd-ec54-446b-a13d-c8f1d2ba1555
			- ^^Product description^^ A description of each product’s purpose, composition, derivation and quality criteria.
			  id:: 2c5ebf41-405c-4a38-a1c1-0fe551688129
				- The product description is used to understand the detailed nature, purpose, function and appearance of a product. It is produced as soon as the need for the product is identified.
				  id:: b2829a2e-82b4-448d-be20-7f7f2a68617f
				- When creating a product description, consider the following:
				  id:: 72b12dc9-b562-46d5-aeb1-b1c35fe08432
					- Product descriptions should be written as soon as possible after the need for the product has been identified. Initially, these may only be ‘skeletons’ with little more than the title and identifier as information. They will be refined and amended as the product becomes better understood and the later planning steps are done. Therefore, early in planning ‘write’ (as in write a product description) can mean ‘start to write and complete as soon as information becomes available’.
					  id:: 19c0eb55-b651-4c25-8eac-921d6b75e831
			- [[Product breakdown structure]] A hierarchy of all the products to be produced during a plan.
			  id:: cce38e63-8f3c-411b-89ac-fd4d9044c7e8
				- A product breakdown structure is a hierarchical breakdown of the products to be produced during a plan; in PRINCE2 a product breakdown structure contains just products
				  id:: 270a8d81-6507-449b-aedd-843955c02c35
				- When presenting the product breakdown structure, consider the use of different shapes, styles or colours for different types of product. For example, a rectangle could be used in a product breakdown structure to represent most types of product, but it may be helpful to use different shapes (such as ellipses or circles) to distinguish externally sourced products. Colours could be used to indicate which team is responsible for the product or in which management stage the product will be created.
				  id:: af241751-ce70-45ca-baf2-2ec01954a97f
				- [[A work breakdown structure]] is a hierarchical breakdown of the entire work that needs to be completed during a plan; in PRINCE2 a work breakdown structure contains just activities.
				  id:: 0fd70fa9-27be-486e-8232-081fb3dee29c
					- The PMI’s PMBOK® Guide (Project Management Institute, 2013) defines a work breakdown structure as: ‘A deliverable-oriented hierarchical decomposition of the work to be executed by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. It organizes and defines the total scope of work.’
					  id:: 9c8e4212-a0ca-44b8-87a0-bf87dd115b6e
					- Users of PRINCE2 from a PMI background might find it useful to substitute the phrase ‘product-oriented work breakdown structure’ when they see product breakdown structure in the PRINCE2 manual.
					  id:: 7b3c6cc3-d2de-46eb-b11c-deedd055ea74
					- Importantly, both uses of the terminology agree that project managers need to plan by breaking down the products or outputs of the project first and, only then, break down the activity needed to produce the products
					  id:: 10e88c5c-f9f4-40a7-9252-96e671941be5
				- Creating a product breakdown structure
				  id:: 4fc27186-6165-420f-bc4e-47a8236add88
					- The plan is broken down into its major products, which are then further broken down until an appropriate level of detail for the plan is reached. A lower-level product can be a component of only one higher-level product. The resultant hierarchy of products is known as a product breakdown structure.
					  id:: 1aaa7d1c-5313-40cc-b6c3-25ed5d96dd0f
					- The format and presentation of the product breakdown structure and product flow diagram are determined by personal preference. See Appendix D for examples.
					  id:: 4aa45712-5f12-4f6f-bc06-e5cfc2f8d446
					- When creating a product breakdown structure, consider the following:
					  id:: 0fc85e81-cf46-454c-8350-9be9679ba213
						- It is usual to involve a team of people in the creation of a product breakdown structure, perhaps representing the different interests and various skill sets involved in the plan’s output.
						  id:: 67188e34-0cf6-4cbc-9161-b25171304b81
						- It is common to identify products by running a structured brainstorming session (e.g. using sticky notes or a whiteboard) to capture each product as it is identified.
						  id:: 88c8ea51-9ea3-4405-91d7-7b999ec76449
						- When a team is creating a product breakdown structure, there are likely to be different opinions on how to break down the products. For example, if the output of the plan is a computerized accounts system, users might want to separate the system into accounts payable, accounts receivable
						  id:: 7efd7bb4-9324-46c7-a407-6041e472f8ea
			- ^^Plan^^ Provides a statement of how and when objectives are to be achieved, by showing the major products, activities and resources required for the scope of the plan. In PRINCE2, there are three levels of plan: project, stage and team. In addition, PRINCE2 has exception plans, which are created at the same level as the plan they are replacing.
			  id:: 18e6a18f-36cb-4a8b-876f-51cead8fae93
				- When using product-based planning, it is important to consider whether to include different states of a particular product. An example of product states is ‘dismantled machinery, moved machinery and reassembled machinery’. It could be appropriate to identify the different states as separate products, where each state would require its own product description with different quality criteria and quality controls. This may be particularly useful when the responsibility for creating each state will pass from one team to another. Alternatively, a single product description could be used with a set of quality criteria that the product needs to meet in order to gain approval for each state
				  id:: 48e510c4-c9a9-4e39-8736-2e7b94bbb903
			- PRINCE2 recommends, but does not require, that an additional product is created and maintained: ^^the product flow diagram^^. This is a diagram showing the sequence of production and interdependencies of the products listed in a product breakdown structure.
			  id:: 118448ea-c107-4c1f-a35d-de0c577dd0e6
				- A product flow diagram may be helpful in identifying and defining the sequence in which the products of the plan will be developed and any dependencies between them (see Figure D.4 in Appendix D for an example of a product flow diagram).
				  id:: ad89b003-106e-4a1f-bbf0-d2061c5aa86c
				- The product flow diagram also helps to identify dependencies on any products outside the scope of the plan. It leads naturally to the consideration of the activities required, and provides the information for other planning techniques, such as estimating and schedu
				  id:: 027f292f-8503-45af-8b8e-880a4e546977
				- The activities should include management and quality checking activities as well as the activities needed to develop the specialist products. The activities should include any that are required to interact with external parties; for example, obtaining a product from an external source or converting such externally sourced products into something that the plan requires.
				  id:: 9254673e-bd87-496b-94fc-09535371e671
				- After the activities have been identified, any dependencies between activities (and products) should also be identified. It is important that dependencies are captured (e.g. on the product flow diagram or some form of register) and that someone responsible for managing the dependency is identified (the project manager or some other nominated person). Key dependencies should be noted in the project plan. Consideration should be given to identifying threats to the plan related to dependencies
				  id:: 60c3472f-8db7-43a9-8659-0b3a936d3244
		- A ^^stage plan^^ is required for each management stage. The stage plan is similar to the project plan in content, but each element is broken down to the level of detail required for day-to-day control by the project manager.
			- A product description is required for all products identified in a stage plan.
			- The initiation stage plan is created during the starting up a project process, prior to the project plan in the initiating a project process. It is influenced by the corporate, programme management or customer plan (or equivalent) from the organization commissioning the project. All subsequent stage plans are produced near the end of the current management stage when preparing for the next management stage. This approach allows the stage plan to:
				- be produced close to the time when the planned events will take place
				- exist for a much shorter duration than the project plan, overcoming the planning horizon issue
				- be produced with the knowledge of the performance of earlier management stages.
		- [[Exemption Plans]]
		  id:: 3f6b3b2d-0240-4389-90b9-228b4b3779a4
			- A plan that often follows an exception report. For a stage plan exception, it covers the period from the present to the end of the current management stage. If the exception is at project level, the project plan will be replaced.
			  id:: 26d47c4c-d56b-451f-b3d2-5c2cb903d9f0
			- Exception plans must be produced to show the actions required to recover from or avoid a forecast deviation from agreed tolerances in the project plan or a stage plan. See Chapter 12 for more explanation of the use of tolerance in PRINCE2. Exception plans are prepared to the same level of detail as the plan they replace. If approved, the exception plan replaces the plan that is in exception and becomes the new baselined plan.
			  id:: baee8b23-00a7-4dd2-a7c4-d9be46a62ede
			- If a stage plan is being replaced, this needs the approval of the project board. Replacement of a project plan should be referred by the project board to corporate, programme management or the customer if it is beyond the authority of the project board.
			  id:: cd55085a-f264-4922-a4dc-af9271d6a4d6
			- Exception plans are not produced for team plans used to manage the delivery of work packages
			  id:: 1135bd61-e040-4f56-a4bd-4ea219665b4d
		- Definition: [[Work package]]
			- The set of information relevant to the creation of one or more products. It will contain a description of the work, the product description(s), details of any constraints on production, and confirmation of the agreement between the project manager and the person or team manager who is to implement the work package that the work can be done within the constraints.
		- 9.4. Techniques: prioritization, estimation and scheduling
		  id:: 8dbbd345-af24-45f6-b28d-ae715ad410ed
			- Projects seldom have the money, time or resources to deliver everything wanted by the business, users or suppliers, even if delivery of everything has a business justification.
			  id:: 5aa86a0c-0a9b-42b9-abd5-4d47fd225a07
			- This means that on most projects acceptance criteria and quality criteria need to be prioritized, with the project attempting to deliver as much as is possible and for which there is a business justification.
			  id:: bee547de-3d0b-4fbb-8c25-b4e7898fd8f7
			- In the absence of any other approach, PRINCE2 recommends the use of a technique called MoSCoW as a general prioritization technique. MoSCoW stands for:
			  id:: c21f2358-4755-4fad-b011-48cf05830f56
				- Must have
				  id:: efec5c5a-1658-452a-b8a7-7e9d4e2bbdd3
				- Should have
				  id:: f7e22b24-f646-4141-b32e-33dc38ff4cde
				- Could have

				- Won’t have.
				  id:: 76db3bdd-d805-4ec6-ab56-13c58066e591
			- Only those things identified as ‘must have’ are guaranteed to be delivered by a project.

			- MoSCoW can be used in a range of prioritization contexts, such as prioritizing issues and changes. In the context of acceptance criteria and quality criteria the following definitions apply:
			  id:: dfa68cd4-a1fa-4371-9f54-b12df6cb8e6c
				- Must have The acceptance criteria or quality criteria define what is essential and critical to the business justification of the project. This would include failing to meet a legal or regulatory requirement. 
				  id:: 6e14bf8f-3c1b-4b3a-ba4b-e6eaf6d3f9f0
					- If the business justification for the project is viable without the criteria, even if it would involve undesirable workarounds, then the criteria are not ‘must haves’.
					  id:: cbfe13b4-04ae-40cc-b097-d7f96684a404
				- Should have The acceptance or quality criteria define what is important, but not critical, to the business justification of the project. Their absence materially weakens the business justification.
				  id:: d278b8b9-0325-490b-9928-dcc18c6c36fc
				- Could have The acceptance or quality criteria define what is useful, but not critical, to the business justification of the project. Their absence does not weaken the business justification. 
				  id:: 06f67cfa-e43e-4ee3-b642-79ba3b75bb81
					- In practical terms the distinction between should have and could have can be difficult to make. In practice it is often determined by:
					  id:: a13e7862-187b-4c12-88a1-58a95dfad292
						- a level of impact on the business justification. For example, a criterion might be considered ‘should have’ if it has greater than 1 per cent impact on benefits
						  id:: 37431509-ac9d-47d7-b690-b1b4375afe5e
						- an assessment of the actual or perceived impact of not having satisfied the requirement. For example, a ‘no manual workarounds’ restriction might be the difference between should have and could have.
						  id:: 313ee321-f736-41be-8971-5e78e8313e6a
				- Won’t have The acceptance criteria or quality criteria define what has been considered but will not be delivered. Even though it might appear strange to record what is not going to be delivered by a project, doing so is often powerful as it formalizes an agreement to not deliver something. This acts as a reminder that something has been consciously considered and can avoid the requirements being reintroduced at a later date.

			- MoSCoW can be used for other types of prioritization, such as prioritizing changes, by adapting the criteria as necessary. When MoSCoW is used in this way, the criteria for must have, should have and could have should always be based on the impact on business justification, in line with PRINCE2’s continued business justification principle.

			- The MoSCoW technique can also help to define scope tolerances, supporting the manage by exception principle.

	- 10.1. The risk theme
		- Definition: Risk
		  id:: f2a2636a-4c24-4c33-aa06-cc12a59c6757
			- An uncertain event or set of events that, should it occur, will have an effect on the achievement of objectives. A risk is measured by a combination of the probability of a perceived threat or opportunity occurring, and the magnitude of its impact on objectives.
			  id:: a7cd5b9e-232f-4770-b833-06f5eeb15a69
				- Risks can have either a negative or positive impact on objectives if they occur. PRINCE2 uses the terms:
				  id:: 3b7cd437-4ecd-4a2c-8d78-ddcacce5ddcc
					- Threat For uncertain events that would have a negative impact on objectives.
					  id:: 355417bb-186b-4c7a-9af3-8536265a1578
					- Opportunity For uncertain events that would have a positive impact on objectives.
					  id:: 23467fff-a45c-480d-8d64-6cf9fda0215c
			- For risk management to be effective: risks that might affect the project achieving its objectives need to be identified, captured and described each risk needs to be assessed to understand its probability, impact and timing (proximity) so that it can be prioritized. The overall risk exposure needs to be kept under review, together with the impact of risk on the overall business justification for the project responses to each risk need to be planned, and assigned to people to action and to own risk responses need to be implemented, monitored and controlled.
			  id:: 015df86a-57f8-45f0-a3b8-9d348592deda
			- To be following PRINCE2, a project must, as a minimum:
				- define its risk management approach, which must minimally cover:
				- how risks are identified and assessed, how risk management responses are planned and implemented and how the management of risk is communicated throughout the project lifecycle
				- assessing whether identified risks might have a material impact on the business justification of the project (PRINCE2’s continued business justification principle)
				- the roles and responsibilities for risk management (PRINCE2’s defined roles and responsibilities principle)
				- maintain some form of risk register to record identified risks and decisions relating to their analysis, management and review
				- ensure that project risks are identified, assessed, managed and reviewed throughout the project lifecycle
				- use lessons to inform risk identification and management (PRINCE2’s learn from experience principle).
			- PRINCE2 requires that two products are produced and maintained:
				- Risk management approach Describes how risk will be managed on the project. This includes the specific processes, procedures, techniques, standards and responsibilities to be applied.
				- Risk register Provides a record of identified risks relating to the project, including their status and history. It is used to capture and maintain information on all the identified threats and opportunities relating to the project.
