- Notes
	 - [Metacognition]([[metacognition]])
		 - Is thinking about thinking

		 - Going above the material you're learning and intentionally aware of how you learn and its continual improvement
			 - Example I'm learning more easily about decision making than computer programming

		 - Identifying successful approaches to learning

		 - Three type of knowledge in metacognition
			 - [[Declarative Knowledge]]
				 - Consists of what you as a learner, other people as learners and universal facts about learning. 
					 - For example immersion is a more effective method in language learning than studying

			 - [[Procedural  Knowledge]]
				 - Knowledge specific to the task at hand and what you know how to complete it
					 - In language learning we need to master speaking, reading and writing. 

			 - [[Strategic Knowledge]]
				 - The methods you know for learning and the insights you have on problem solving. 

			 - [[The four levels of metacognitive learning]]
				 - [[Tacit Learning]]
					 - Not thinking metacognitively.

					 - They know what they do or don't know but are not engaging on the quality of their knowledge. (How well they understand their own knowledge)

				 - [[Aware Learning]]
					 - Some awareness of the learning process but lacking full understanding and follow through on the awareness

				 - [[Strategic Learning]]
					 - Awareness of how to organize learning and seeking out methodologies to improve it

					 - They are aware that some methods are more efficacious than others depending on the type of knowledge being learned, therefore they are more willing to experiment

				 - [[Reflecting Learning]]
					 - The same as [[Strategic Learning]] but monitoring the efficacy through the learning process and modifying the methods through the process. [[Double Loop Learning]]

		 - Improving Metacognition
			 - Be cognizant of your learning processes and gain constant awareness during the learning experience

			 - Reflect and take notes after learning sessions
				 - Make those notes on learning actionable

				 - The muddiest point
					 - Take note of when learning is the hardest and try to find solutions 

			 - Keep a learning diary
				 - Record the decision making process and its outcomes

				 - Reflect on how certain methodologies and frameworks work for each certain type of decision
