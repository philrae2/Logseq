		 - No experience is itself a cause of our success or failure. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences—the so-called trauma—but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes. We are not determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining.

		 - No matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how you live from now on.

- **Note:**
	 - Our interpretation of the stimulus from our past and present environment affects our emotions and outward behaviors. If we carefully think through them and choose to interpret these events in a positive way and therefore behave constructively. Usually if we are reactive to our present stimulus we can act rashly and may live to regret our actions.

	 - Our emotions are tools for communication. We can still communicate with others without using negative emotions.
