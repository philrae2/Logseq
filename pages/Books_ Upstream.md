- Chapter 1 - Moving Upstream
	 - Look for inefficiencies in the systems and processes. Not only look at your possible improvements but other teams, divisions, and offices.
		 - If it's measurable then it can be prevented or reduced, therefore shows some level of inefficiency?

		 - > Specialization creates efficiencies but deters efforts to integrate in new, advantageous ways

	 - Upstream work or [[preventative]] work is difficult to measure and therefore not as visible as reactionary work, as that work is visible and measurable.

	 - Upstream or [[preventative]] thinking requires [[Systems Thinking]] to understand and engage in. We can build [[efficiency]] at several points of the system and timeline

	 - Our attention to [[problem solving]] is asymmetrical looking at problems at a reactionary point of view rather than upstream

- Barriers to upstream thinking
	 - __Problem blindness__ - is when we believe negative outcomes are natural or inevitable like the weather and therefore we don't try to prevent them
		 - Look for signals for risk when analyzing systems for improvement and then take action #[[q: How to be proactive]]

		 - Problems we have are due to its design

		 - To solve upstream problems, leaders must detect problems early, target leverage points in complex systems, find reliable ways to measure success, pioneer new ways of working together, and embed their successes into systems to give them permanence.

		 - We may have inattentional blindness due to the narrow focus of our work and siloed teams. This is exacerbated when we are crunched for time.
			 - Once something is coded as a problem, it demands a solution. It creates an implied obligation. 

- A Lack of Ownership
	 - A fragmented role and responsibility can lead to lack of ownership to problems. 

	 - When we see a problem, first frame the situation as if you caused it to see the leverage points where you can take action to improve the situation and environment.

- Tunneling
	 - When people are juggling many problems, we give up trying to solve all of them. We lose sight of the long-term planning and there's no strategic prioritization of issues. It confines us to short-term, reactive thinking. 

	 - An environment of scarcity (resources like time and money) promotes a state of tunneling. People who tunnel can't engage in systems thinking; they can't prevent problems.  They just react.

	 - Tunneling feels good because it solves problems right away at the expense of delaying long-term consequences. Tunneling is like taking a pay-day loan that we'll eventually have to pay back in the future with significant interest.

	 - Slack can be used to get out of tunneling. It is time spent out of the tunnel to think about upstream solutions to problem. It should be collaborative and disciplined.
		 - > Escaping a tunnel can be difficult, because it is organizational structure resists it. When we give people focus we create a state of myopia. Focus is both an enemy and an ally. It makes accelerates and creates efficient work but it also blinds people. 

- No sense of urgency
	 - We can create a sense of urgency to get a problem noticed and fixed.
		 - Create urgency by messaging out the consequences of inaction.

- 5. How will you unite the right people (to solve a problem) #[[q: How to build a good working group]]
	 - The right people are the ones who have influence to change the situation and each person has a role and a job to do.
		 - The right people are the ones able to address all the key dimensions of the issue. 

		 - Create a compelling and important goal for the group, a shared goal that keeps them contributing even in stressful situations

	 - Provide a stream of data that is used for learning, not inspection. The data design should point out where the gaps are in the problem and help solve the issue. Data design for inspection is not helpful other than blaming. 
		 - When data is used for inspection it sounds like __"Smith, you didn't meet your sales target last quarterâ€”What happened?"__

	 - Everyone in the group should believe that the problem is solvable.

- 6. How will you change the system? 
	 - Changing the system requires power and influence

- 7. Where can you find a point of leverage
	 - Finding the right lever and fulcrum is the hard part when preventing problems in complex systems. 
		 - To find the correct levers, we have to immerse ourselves in the problem

- 8. How will you get an early warning of the problem
	 - Signals maybe harmful if they lead you to take a wrong action, such as false positives (which may or may not be bad depending on the risk/benefit ratio)

- 9. How will you know you're succeeding?
	 - Downstream intervention success are easier to measure because it restores to the previous desired state. 

	 - Upstream success is not always self-evident because feedback loops take longer to provide information and usually the loop is too complicated with different variables.
		 - The complex feedback loop for upstream interventions can return false successes that may cloak failure, again due to complex variables intertwined with the upstream effect. 

		 - To measure success and interpret feedback loops correctly we have to make sure we are asking the right questions.
			 - We have to measure the predictive short-term measures correctly (which is a difficult task to accomplish)

			 - We should receive timely data that allows us to adapt and learn. 

		 - Creating measurement tools and predictive tools must be done with care as not to incentivize people to game measures instead of pursuing the end goals. (i.e., choosing easy to treat patients over difficult cases to increase your work count)
			 - People will cheat  when people are incentivized or punished for meeting or failing to meet a number.
				 - Tests and questions to ask to prevent gaming the system:
					 - 1. Rising tides test. If you think you are achieving success on our short term measures, what else might explain that success. Other than our own metrics are we tracking other contributory factors?

					 - 2. The misalignment test: Examine if we are measuring the correct short term factors that lead to the direction of our wanted goals. Is there a better metric that gives better direction?

					 - 3. The lazy bureaucrat test: If a lazy leader wants to game the system by taking the least effort to achieve numbers, what would they do?

					 - 4. The defiling the mission test: What can we do ensure that our measurements are achieving our intended goal and not creating disruptive behavior?

					 - 5. What are the unintended consequences of or short-term measurements.

- 10. How will you avoid doing harm?
	 - When solving system problems make sure we are at a vantage point to see all part of the system to best predict the downstream effects of our upstream actions. 
		 - Know that while short-term changes for the good of the system may run counter to the interests of the part of the system. (i.e., Cost savings in environmental upkeep may end up costing us in unintended settlements to injury lawsuits due to delipidated environment created by cost containment strategies)

	 - Test your knowledge and information. What you know and what other people know are only models. We should validate and experiment to test our assumed models. We can invite others to challenge our models and add to them. 
		 - We don't succeed by predicting the future correctly, but through correct feedback loops.

- 11. Who will pay for what does not happen? 
	 - Upstream work can benefit many different people, however, incentivizing upstream work can be complex because the beneficiaries may not be the ones who are solving the problems. How can we spread the cost of preventative work when they benefit the ones not doing the work, when they benefit the downstream actors? 

- 12. The Chicken Little Problem: Distant and Improbable Threat

- 13. You, Upstream
	 - When working with whole systems we need to balance it with knowing how to help or address the individual level as well. To understand the system we also need to understand the individual component level. 

	 - Make constant improvements and build feedback loops to track your progress when implementing upstream intervention
