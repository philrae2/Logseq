- **Note:** 
	 - Often we end up prioritizing our prevent tasks over useful gain tasks that improve our lives, skills, and intelligence.

	 - Just because something is urgent doesn't mean urgent things should make up the bulk of our daily activities. We will never move forward in improving our lives if all we do is prevention tasks.
