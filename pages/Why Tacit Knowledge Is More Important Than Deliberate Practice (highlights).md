	- Tacit knowledge is knowledge that **cannot be captured through words alone**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2sjpkztgnkqmaqt6h6rh2rh))
	- In pedagogy, this is known as ‘[transmissionism](https://andymatuschak.org/books/)’, and it is regarded amongst serious educators with the same sort of derision you and I might have about flat-earth theories today. It goes something like this: some people believe that it is possible to teach technique by *explaining* things to others. They think that if you can find just the right combinations of words with the right sorts of analogies; if you can really break things down into the right level of atomic details, things will magically click in their students’s heads and they will succeed.

	- tacit knowledge instruction happens through things like imitation, emulation, and apprenticeship. You learn by copying what the master does, blindly, until you internalise the principles behind the actions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2sjp9n1sev75sgz4fqwysf3))

	- giving people a list of procedures to execute, blindly, denies them the ability to build expertise, which in turns prevents them from doing the sorts of creative problem solving that is common amongst expert operators. It also means that when something goes drastically wrong — and something *always* goes drastically wrong in the real world — they would not be able to adapt. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2vv2wtq30a4y5gas3rb2j41))
	- deliberate practice is defined as possible *only* in domains with a long history of well-established pedagogy. In other words, deliberate practice **can only exist in fields like music and math and chess**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2vvb98f7kaf09fsyjg36ett))
