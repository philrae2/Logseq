title: P: One of the ways to build on your [[competitive advantage]] is to build [[resiliency]] and [[self-organization]] into your system and workflow processes
---

- To improve the quality of our products and outputs we need to invest resources and time reexamining our workflow processes. One of our default approaches for process improvement is to pay evaluate and assess the individual parts of the system for improvements.

- However, according to System's thinking, efforts to change or improve individual components of the system provides the least return of attention or investment of time and resources. Systems Thinking instead recommends investing time and effort in analyzing the system holistically and examine its inter-connected relationships-the feedback loops and important players, such as the system owner(s), of the systems.

- An approaching to building or strengthening resilient processes is to combat prioritization of short term gains over long-term goals.  ((9a6b65c0-54bd-4aa2-95b5-a2c8fe437574))
	 - Examples would be error checking or feedback loops that promote internal improvements for the system--seeking feedback from employees on what the organization is doing well or what can be made better.
		 - [[Resilient systems]] built as [[automatic behaviors]] would also provide low maintenance and continual value, ensuring prioritization of future gains. SOPs, [[standardization]], and [[modular solutions]] are examples of automatic resilient systems, if built and designed correctly, promote strong workflow processes

- ((b98713aa-66b7-4f2b-b90d-348b279c07ec)) and this can be leveraged build competitive advantage to prevent organizational stagnancy. Similar to building resiliency, we can employ Systems thinking to cultivate a culture primed for self-organization.
