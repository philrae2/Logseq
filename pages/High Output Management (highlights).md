		- We need to plan our organization like a fire department that can quickly and effectively respond to fires that we cannot anticipate or predict.
		- A responsive company should have fewer levels of managers. This should be easier to apply because of electronic communications have made dissemination of information quicker and efficient.
		- The gaps found today are from decisions and failure of planning from the past. Don't blindly fix symptoms of poor decision making processes.

		- You are not an employee, you are in a business with one employee and that is yourself. You are in competition with millions of other businesses, pickup up the pace, capable of doing the same work that you can do and perhaps more eager to do it. Your fellow workers are not your rivals, they are outnumbered by other workers from other rival firms. So if you want to work and continue to work, you must continually dedicate yourself to retaining your individual competitive advantage.

		- A manager creates value by translating their skills and knowledge to increase the team's performance and output. It's not about how smart you are or how well you know your business.
		- ((643dc388-9070-4642-b071-71fd07722d99))
			- A manager's individual work, even if done well, is not their output. If the manager has a group of people reporting to him or a circle of people influenced by him, the manager's output must be measured by the output of his sphere of influence.
			- If the manager is a knowledge specialist, a know-how manager, his output potential is measured by the influence of his neighboring colleagues or teams or even neighboring organizations. The organization creates the output, not the manager.
		- High Leverage Activities are when:
			- When many people are affected
			- When an activity has a long lasting affect
			- When knowledge shared affects many people
		- The manager not only gathers information but is also the source of it. They must be excellent in communicating  objectives, priorities, and preferences.

		- #[[leading indicators]]
			- Leading indicators give you a way to look inside the "black box" of your process by showing you in advance what the future might look like. They can give you time to take corrective action and make it possible to avoid problems. Examples would be burndown charts, completion of user feedback activities, etc.
			- Trend indicators show output (software modules completed, vouchers processed, people served) measured against time (performance this month versus over a series of previous months)
			- Stagger charts forecasts an output over the next several months. The chart is updated monthly, so that each month you will have an updated version of the then-current forecast information as compared to several prior forecasts.

	- Leverage is the output generated by a specific type of work activity. An activity with high leverage will generate a high level of output.
	  collapsed:: true
		- It becomes very important to arrange the processes in our workflow as high leverage activities—activities that have high output.
		- Automation is one option to increase leverage by using machines.
		- Simplification of the work processes is another option for increasing leverage. Simplification first needs a current-state flow chart of the production process. Every single step must be shown and no omissions made to pretty up the process. Then set a target for reduction of the number of steps.
			- To perform the simplification, you must ask why each step is performed.
		- Simplification for knowledge workers—administration and management—is new and slow to take hold. The major problem is defining what the output of such work is and should be. For these professions it is difficult to distinguish between activity and output.
		- A significant portion of a manager's activity has to do with allocating resources: manpower, money, and capital. But the single most important resource is our own time—it is the absolute finite resource we have. Therefore how we handle our own time is the single most important aspect of being a role model and leader.

			- Increase the rate of performance for activities, speeding up the work

	- #[[Decision Making]]
		- Decisions can be categorized into two buckets: decisions that look forward and ones that we make in response to crises and problems.
		- The quality of decision-making is dependent on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business.
		- Information gathering is the basis of all other managerial work.

		  collapsed:: true
			- ((6442d1ce-dd8c-4a68-972b-4ac7dc214ea0))
			- Free discussion - where all points of view and all aspects of the issue are openly welcomed and debated. The greater the disagreement and controversy the more important becomes the word free.
			- The next stage is clear decision making. Again, the greater the disagreement about the issue, the more important it is for everyone to have a clear understanding of the issue.
			- The last stage is the full support of a decision. Not everyone must agree on the plan, but participants commit to back the decision. Many people have trouble supporting a decision with which they do not agree, but that they need to do so is simply inevitable.
		- Blockers of good decision-making
			- Fear of looking bad. Each time an insight or fact is withheld an an appropriate question is suppressed, the decision-making process is less good than it might have been.
			- Find right balance for the timing of decision-making. Don't push for pre-mature decision without having considered and heard the real issues rather than the superficial comments that often dominate the early part of a meeting.

	- You need to try to do the impossible, to anticipate the unexpected. And when the unexpected happens, you should double your efforts to make order from the disorder it creates in your life. The motto I’m advocating is *“Let chaos reign, then rein in chaos.”* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxch03vscvqxqp6fm2jap79e))
	  id:: 643dc388-17ed-4930-aba0-4f6f01b52663
	- As a *micro CEO,* you can improve your own and your group’s performance and productivity, whether or not the rest of the company follows suit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxch10ztw4adpegdzn3cbt9z))
	- We must recognize that no amount of formal planning can anticipate changes such as globalization and the information revolution we’ve referred to above. Does that mean that you shouldn’t plan? Not at all. You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcj7cf3y2af3yf32t5tj137))
	- Second, a responsive company should have fewer levels of managers. This concept is easier to apply today as electronic mail can carry information to anyone in the organization. One basic role of management—the role of disseminating information—is no longer as important a managerial function as it was in the past. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcj7z9adjny2sm7jgh9cqgj))
	- Nor do you need to rely on one-on-ones to catch up with what your subordinates have found in their lab, factory, or sales region; you’ve already read about those developments on your computer screen, minutes after they chose to inform you ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcj991azmmpx1746j32tztc))
	- As a general rule, you have to accept that no matter where you work, you are not an employee—you are in a business with one employee: yourself. You are in competition with millions of similar businesses. There are millions of others all over the world, picking up the pace, capable of doing the same work that you can do and perhaps more eager to do it. Now, you may be tempted to look around your workplace and point to your fellow workers as rivals, but they are not. They are outnumbered—a thousand to one, one hundred thousand to one, a million to one—by people who work for organizations that compete with your firm. So if you want to work and continue to work, you must continually dedicate yourself to retaining your *individual* competitive advantage ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcjbdwsp1sqhm7sqbr5px9c))
	- The point is, the clichés of globalization and the information revolution have real meaning—potentially deadly meaning—for your career. The sad news is, nobody owes you a career. You own it as a sole proprietor. You must compete with millions of individuals every day, and every day you must enhance your value, hone your competitive advantage, learn, adapt, get out of the way, move from job to job, even from industry to industry if you must and retrench if you need to do so in order to start again. The key task is to manage your career so that you do not become a casualty.
		- I can offer you no surefire formula. But here are a few questions to ponder:
			- Are you adding real value or merely passing information along? How do you add more value? By continually looking for ways to make things truly better in your department. You are a manager. The central thought of my book is that the output of a manager is the output of his organization. In principle, every hour of your day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people whom you’re responsible for.
			  id:: 643eccf5-e4fa-4c30-a4f4-8e9479160ae0
			- Are you plugged into what’s happening around you? And that includes what’s happening inside your company as well as inside your industry as a whole. Or do you wait for a supervisor or others to interpret whatever is happening? Are you a node connected to a network of plugged-in people or are you floating by yourself?
			  id:: 643eccfb-972d-4b86-8ce8-2a5c91be60ef
			- Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies, and I mean personally trying them, not just reading about them? Or are you waiting for others to figure out how they can re-engineer your workplace—and you out of that workplace ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcjdvhsk0rzffpxdxcf8d04))

	- Andy introduces management with this classic equation:
	  id:: 643dc388-81f9-4fba-86aa-62acfb046754
	  
	  > A manager’s output = the output of his organization + the output of the neighboring organizations under his influence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcjhtm0bsr6gpcd1e594fx7))
	- A manager’s skills and knowledge are only valuable if she uses them to get more leverage from her people. So, Ms. Manager, you know more about our product’s viral loop than anyone in the company? That’s worth exactly nothing unless you can effectively transfer that knowledge to the rest of the organization. That’s what being a manager is about. It’s not about how smart you are or how well you know your business; it’s about how that translates to the team’s performance and output ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcjja4949zmnmdqegfmygmt))
	- “I have seen far too many people who upon recognizing today’s gap try very hard to determine what decision has to be made to close it. But today’s gap represents a failure of planning sometime in the past.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcjme3fm8fk36s00jx34hk4))
		- **Note**: What do you do with this information?
	- If you only understand one thing about building products, you must understand that energy put in early in the process pays off tenfold and energy put in at the end of the program pays off negative tenfold ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcjmtps779z9j96zbhb8p88))
	- > Everyone must decide for himself what is professional and appropriate here. A test might be to imagine yourself delivering a tough performance review to your friend. Do you cringe at the thought? If so, don’t make friends at work. If your stomach remains unaffected, you are likely to be someone whose personal relationships will strengthen work relationships.
	  
	  By breaking down the process, he makes hard things manageable.
	  
	  Ultimately, the power of *High Output Management* is that it creates expert rather than merely competent managers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcjpnz75fvgy4dfbgvpy3fv))
	- *Is it better to be a hands-on or hands-off manager?”*
	  
	  It seems like a simple enough question, but it sorts out the 95 percent of managers who never think deeply about their craft from the 5 percent who do. The answer, as Andy explains, is that it depends. Specifically, it depends on the employee. If the employee is immature in the task, then hands-on training is essential. If the employee is more mature, then a delegate approach is warranted. Andy presents a great example of this: “The subordinate did poor work. My associate’s reaction: ‘He has to make his own mistakes. That’s how he learns!’ The problem with this is that the subordinate’s tuition is paid by his customers. And that is absolutely wrong.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcjr3j7apmgx1pxwjyqhf7d))
	- Finally, he reiterates his thesis that there are only two ways in which a manager can impact an employee’s output: motivation and training. If you are not training, then you are basically neglecting half the job. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcjsb2ssdgfc2ty07f7ww50))

	- “In order to build anything great, you have to be an optimist, because by definition you are trying to do something that most people would consider impossible. Optimists most certainly do not listen to leading indicators of bad news.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcjw0gnwzc9k1w4z5xka59e))
	- The Peter Principle is a concept in management theory in which the selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate’s performance in their current role, rather than on abilities related to the intended role.

	- How would our model reflect the change in manufacturing flow? Working back from the time of breakfast delivery, let’s see how the production is affected, as illustrated opposite. The egg cycle remains the same, as does the one for coffee. But limited toaster capacity makes for quite a difference. Now you must account for the delivery time of the toast and the wait for a free toaster. This means the whole production process has to be conceived differently. Toaster capacity has become the limiting step, and what you do has to be reworked around it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcksq7vma4akfm897yqdfzj))
		- **Note**: Without considering capacity for the toaster, making eggs would be the rate limiting step.

	- Because each alternative costs money, your task is to find the *most cost-effective* way to deploy your resources—the key to optimizing all types of productive work. Bear in mind that in this and in other such situations there is a right answer, the one that can give you the best delivery time and product quality at the lowest possible cost. To find that right answer, you must develop a clear understanding of the trade-offs between the various factors—manpower, capacity, and inventory—and you must reduce the understanding to a quantifiable set of relationships. You probably won’t use a stopwatch to conduct a time-and-motion study of the person behind a toaster; nor will you calculate the precise trade-off between the cost of toast inventory and the added toaster capacity in mathematical terms. What is important is the thinking you force yourself to go through to understand the relationship between the various aspects of your production process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxckxwbswpb3z55z0td55tna))
	- How do you minimize the risk of a breakdown of this sort? Performing a *functional test* is one way. From time to time you open an egg as it comes out of the machine and check its quality. But you will have to throw away the egg tested. A second way involves *in-process inspection,* which can take many forms. You could, for example, simply insert a thermometer into the water so that the temperature could be easily and frequently checked. To avoid having to pay someone to read the thermometer, you could connect an electronic gadget to it that would set off bells anytime the temperature varied by a degree or two. The point is that whenever possible, you should choose in-process tests over those that destroy product ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxckzv7jnt51hrykps6e4qhy))

	- What else could go wrong with our continuous egg-machine? The eggs going into it could be cracked or rotten, or they could be over- or undersized, which would affect how fast they cook. To avoid such problems, you will want to look at the eggs at the time of receipt, something called *incoming* or *receiving inspection.* If the eggs are unacceptable in some way, you are going to have to send them back, leaving you with none. Now you have to shut down. To avoid that, you need a *raw material inventory.* But how large should it be? The principle to be applied here is that you should have enough to cover your consumption rate for the length of time it takes to replace your raw material. That means if your egg man comes by and delivers once a day, you want to keep a day’s worth of inventory on hand to protect yourself. But remember, inventory costs money, so you have to weigh the advantage of carrying a day’s supply against the cost of carrying it. Besides the cost of the raw material and the cost of money, you should also try to gauge the *opportunity at risk:* what would it cost if you had to shut your egg machine down for a day? How many customers would you lose? How much would it cost to lure them back? Such questions define the opportunity at risk. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxejz25hmf7a6xntv0aetdgz))
		- **Note**: Does this concept have relevance to software development? Difficult to tie tangible manufacturing that includes material goods with software delivery.
	- *Adding Value*
	  
	  All production flows have a basic characteristic: the material becomes more valuable as it moves through the process. A boiled egg is more valuable than a raw one, a fully assembled breakfast is more valuable than its constituent parts, and finally, the breakfast placed in front of the customer is more valuable still. The last carries the perceived value the customer associates with the establishment when he drives into the parking lot after seeing the sign “Andy’s Better Breakfasts.” Similarly, a finished compiler is more valuable than the constituent parts of semantic analysis, code generation, and run time, and a college graduate to whom we are ready to extend an employment offer is more valuable to us than the college student we meet on campus for the first time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxek304vkagpm7x2w3evt19v))
	- A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the *lowest-value* stage possible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxek3d5yt79pmsd5wvjxs9xv))
	- Let’s say that as manager of the breakfast factory, you will work with five indicators to meet your production goals on a daily basis. Which five would they be? Put another way, which five pieces of information would you want to look at each day, immediately upon arriving at your office? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxekjkc1bjtxhjp3dayrtwp5))
	- To assess how much confidence you should place in your forecast, you would want to know how many you delivered yesterday compared to how many you planned on delivering—in other words, the *variance* between your plan and the actual delivery of breakfasts for the preceding day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxekk5da0b93zgber5hxacgz))
	- Your next key indicator is *raw material inventory.* Do you have enough eggs, bread, and coffee on hand to keep your factory running today? If you find you have too little inventory, you can still order more. If you find you have too much, you may want to cancel today’s egg delivery. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxekkdepk50q5rgkmv5be0zf))
	- Another important piece of information is the condition of your *equipment.* If anything broke down yesterday, you will want to get it repaired or rearrange your production line to meet your forecast for the day ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxekkqzd807t80eekhpgzca6))
	- Finally, you want to have some kind of *quality* indicator. It is not enough to monitor the number of breakfasts each waiter delivers, because the waiters could have been rude to the customers even as they served a record number of breakfasts. Because your business depends on people wanting what you sell, you must be concerned with the public’s opinion of your service. Perhaps you should set up a “customer complaint log” maintained by the cashier. If one of your waiters elicited more than the usual number of complaints yesterday, you will want to speak to him first thing today. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxeknz1rgzjqtb2p2r16gmxw))
	- Indicators tend to direct your attention toward what they are monitoring. It is like riding a bicycle: you will probably steer it where you are looking. If, for example, you start measuring your inventory levels carefully, you are likely to take action to drive your inventory levels down, which is good up to a point. But your inventories could become so lean that you can’t react to changes in demand without creating shortages. So because indicators direct one’s activities, you should guard against overreacting. This you can do by *pairing* indicators, so that together both effect and counter-effect are measured. Thus, in the inventory example, you need to monitor both inventory levels and the incidence of shortages. A rise in the latter will obviously lead you to do things to keep inventories from becoming too low. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxekqmpdpge443agjs3dsbzc))
	- The principle here was evident many times in the development of a compiler. Measuring the completion date of each software unit against its capability is one example. Watching this pair of indicators should help us to avoid working on the perfect compiler that will never be ready, and also to avoid rushing to finish one that is inadequate. In sum, joint monitoring is likely to keep things in the optimum middle ground. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxekqfechrwwthqbpkae0b1w))
	- Nowhere can indicators—and paired indicators—be of more help than in administrative work. Having come to this realization, our company has been using measurements as a key tool to improve the productivity of administrative work for several years. The first rule is that a measurement—any measurement—is better than none. But a genuinely effective indicator will cover the *output* of the work unit and not simply the *activity* involved. Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxekrkkgeyz6h0scr33yybj6))
	- The second criterion for a good indicator is that what you measure should be a *physical, countable* thing. Examples of effective measures of administrative output are shown below. Because those listed here are all quantity or output indicators, their paired counterparts should stress the *quality* of work. Thus, in accounts payable, the number of vouchers processed should be paired with the number of errors found either by auditing or by our suppliers. For another example, the number of square feet cleaned by a custodial group should be paired with a partially objective/partially subjective rating of the quality of work as assessed by a senior manager with an office in that building.
	  
	  ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION
	  
	  WORK OUTPUT INDICATOR
	  
	  Accounts payable
	- Such indicators have many uses. First, they spell out very clearly what the objectives of an individual or group are. Second, they provide a degree of objectivity when measuring an administrative function. Third, and as important as any, they give us a measure by which various administrative groups performing the same function in different organizations can be compared with each other ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxem7jve0g87xqce1m0ythme))

	- *Leading indicators* give you one way to look inside the black box by showing you in advance what the future might look like. And because they give you time to take corrective action, they make it possible for you to avoid problems. Of course, for leading indicators to do you any good, *you must believe in their validity.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxenrcrnd3k4v59waz4g0amx))

	- Leading indicators might include the daily monitors we use to run our breakfast factory, from machine downtime records to an index of customer satisfaction—both of which can tell us if problems lie down the road. A generally applicable example of a “window” cut into the black box is the *linearity indicator* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxeqat1cfmd3c0fz4wvcaenz))
	- Thus, the linearity indicator flashes an early warning, allowing us time to take corrective action. Without it, we would discover that we had missed our target in June, when nothing can be done about it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxeqb7twf81z2jh74nngea6h))

	- The linearity indicator can give us an early warning that we are likely to miss our target. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxeqbj36hh7eadkctpnfxnsd))
	- Also valuable are *trend indicators.* These show output (breakfasts delivered, software modules completed, vouchers processed) measured against time (performance this month versus performance over a series of previous months), and also against some standard or expected level. A display of trends forces you to look at the future as you are led to extrapolate almost automatically from the past. This extrapolation gives us another window in our black box. Also, measurement against a standard makes you think through *why* the results were what they were, and not what the standard said they would be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxeqcnkxzsxsg5z5kcv5b0sf))
	- Another sound way to anticipate the future is through the use of the *stagger chart,* which forecasts an output over the next several months. The chart is updated monthly, so that each month you will have an updated version of the then-current forecast information as compared to several prior forecasts. You can readily see the variation of one forecast from the next, which can help you anticipate future trends better than if you used a simple trend chart. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxer728j2wmf4vqcxzvpe0p2))
	- In my experience, nowhere has the stagger chart been more productive than in forecasting economic trends. The way it works is shown in the figure below, which gives us forecasted rates of incoming orders for an Intel division. The stagger chart then provides the same forecast prepared in the following month, in the month after that, and so on. Such a chart shows not only your outlook for business month by month but also how your outlook varied from one month to the next. This way of looking at incoming business, of course, makes whoever does the forecasting take his task very seriously, because he knows that his forecast for any given month will be routinely compared with future forecasts and eventually with the actual result. But even more important, the improvement or deterioration of the forecasted outlook from one month to the next provides the most valuable indicator of business trends that I have ever seen. I would go as far as to say that it’s too bad that all economists and investment advisers aren’t obliged to display their forecasts in a stagger chart form. Then we could really have a way to evaluate whatever any one of them chooses to say.

	- *Controlling Future Output*
	  
	  There are two ways to control the output of any factory. Some industries *build to order.* For example, when you go shopping for a sofa, you are going to have to wait a long time to get what you bought, unless you buy it right off the floor. A furniture factory builds to order. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxerb6wyryq4szyzymp1kz09))
	- But if your competition in the sofa business makes the same product but has it ready in four weeks while you need four months, you are not going to have many customers. So even though you would much rather build to order, you will have to use another way to control the output of your factory. In short, you will have to *build to forecast,* which is a *contemplation of future orders.* To do this, the manufacturer sets up his activities around a reasoned speculation that orders will materialize for specific products within a certain time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxerbpskp0yds4jm709m7rae))
	- Delivering a product that was built to forecast to a customer consists of two simultaneous processes, each with a separate time cycle. A manufacturing flow must occur in which the raw material moves through various production steps and finally enters the finished goods warehouse, as illustrated below. Simultaneously, a salesman finds a prospect and sells to that prospect, who eventually places an order with the manufacturer. Ideally, the order for the product and the product itself should arrive on the shipping dock at the same time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxercve1n501prmv0yw18bxc))

	  id:: 643dc388-b14c-44d6-8a43-bb9069367051
	- The ideal is rarely found in the real world. More often, customer orders don’t develop in time or the customer changes his mind. As for the other flow, manufacturing could miss deadlines, or make mistakes, or encounter unforeseen problems. Because neither the sales flow nor the manufacturing flow is completely predictable, we should deliberately build a reasonable amount of *“slack”* into the system. And inventory is the most obvious place for it. Clearly, the more inventory we have, the more change we can cope with and still satisfy orders. But inventory costs money to build and keep, and therefore should be controlled carefully. Ideally, inventory should be kept at the *lowest-value stage,* as we’ve learned before, like raw eggs kept at the breakfast factory. Also, the lower the value, the more production flexibility we obtain for a given inventory cost ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxerebjnjsxac351r1phxdf3))
	- It is a good idea to use stagger charts in both the manufacturing and sales forecasts. As noted, they will show the trend of change from one forecast to another, as well as the actual results. By repeatedly observing the variance of one forecast from another, you will continually pin down the causes of inaccuracy and improve your ability to forecast both orders and the availability of product ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxerh09fsjgvyrn3yd5hxb9t))
	- To get acceptable quality at the lowest cost, it is vitally important to reject defective material at a stage where its accumulated value is at the lowest possible level. Thus, as noted, we are better off catching a bad raw egg than a cooked one, and screening out our college applicant before he visits Intel. In short, reject before investing further value ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxerjqgkv4t66z172p42xsyz))
	- In the language of production, the lowest-value-point inspection where we inspect raw material is called *incoming material inspection* or *receiving inspection.* If we again use a black box to represent our production process, inspections that occur at intervening points within it are called, logically enough, *in-process* inspections. Finally, the last possible point of inspection, when the product is ready to be shipped to the customer, is called *final inspection* or *outgoing quality inspection.* The three types are depicted below.

	- There is a *gate-like* inspection and a *monitoring* step. In the former, all material is held at the “gate” until the inspection tests are completed. If the material passes, it is moved on to the next stage in the production process; if the material fails, it will be returned to an earlier stage, where it will be reworked or scrapped. In the latter, a sample of the material is taken, and if it fails, a notation is made from which a failure rate is calculated. The bulk of the material is not held as the sample is taken but continues to move through the manufacturing process. The smoothness of the flow is maintained, but if, for example, three successive samples fail the monitoring test, we can stop the line. What is the trade-off here? If we hold all the material, we add to throughput time and slow down the manufacturing process. A monitor produces no comparable slowdown but might let some bad material escape before we can act on the monitor’s results and shut things down, which means that we might have to reject material later at a higher-value stage. Clearly, for the same money we can do a lot more monitoring than gate-type inspections; if we do the former, we may well contribute more to the overall quality of the product than if we choose less frequent gate-like inspections. The trade-off here is not obvious, and any choice has to be made with a specific case in mind. As a rule of thumb, we should lean toward monitoring when experience shows we are not likely to encounter big problems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxes62q701n40k3s0yd0fn4q))
	- Another way to lower the cost of quality assurance is to use *variable inspections.* Because quality levels vary over time, it is only common sense to vary how often we inspect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxes6db7mma92n99c11875np))

	- Here I’d like to introduce the concept of *leverage,* which is the output generated by a specific type of work activity. An activity with high leverage will generate a high level of output; an activity with low leverage, a low level of output. For example, a waiter able to boil two eggs and operate two toasters can deliver two breakfasts for almost the same amount of work as one. His output per activity, and therefore his leverage, is high. A waiter who can handle only one egg and one toaster at a time possesses lower output and leverage ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxesbamtr06ht0x4t0swgkdr))
	- Thus, a very important way to increase productivity is to arrange the work flow inside our black box so that it will be characterized by high output per activity, which is to say high-leverage activities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxescdg41n5j8sh8rp9d3j4z))
	- Automation is certainly one way to improve the leverage of all types of work. Having machines to help them, human beings can create more output. But in both widget manufacturing and administrative work, something else can also increase the productivity of the black box. This is called *work simplification.* To get leverage this way, you first need to create a flow chart of the production process as it exists. Every single step must be shown on it; no step should be omitted in order to pretty things up on paper. Second, count the number of steps in the flow chart so that you know how many you started with. Third, set a rough target for reduction of the number of steps. In the first round of work simplification, our experience shows that you can reasonably expect a 30 to 50 percent reduction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxesgtvss03axx5sed704evh))
	- To implement the actual simplification, you must question *why* each step is performed. Typically, you will find that many steps exist in your work flow for no good reason. Often they are there by tradition or because formal procedure ordains it, and nothing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxeshagmzyxhz779xyzy8vdy))
	- But the application of the principle to improve the productivity of the “soft professions”—the administrative, professional, and managerial workplace—is new and slow to take hold. The major problem to be overcome is defining what the output of such work is or should be. As we will see, in the work of the soft professions, it becomes very difficult to distinguish between output and activity. And as noted, stressing output is the key to improving productivity, while looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxesj7fcsa1v2nc3vrczxhxa))
	- A manager’s output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxeskjj8tnegmffqfc5p671t))

	- A manager can do his “own” job, his individual work, and do it well, but that does not constitute his output. If the manager has a group of people reporting to him or a circle of people influenced by him, the manager’s output must be measured by the output created by his subordinates and associates. If the manager is a knowledge specialist, a *know-how manager,* his potential for influencing “neighboring” organizations is enormous. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxesmd6wgwzettz0z480mra8))
	- But the key definition here is that the output of a manager is a result achieved by a group either under her supervision or under her influence. While the manager’s own work is clearly very important, that in itself does not create output. Her organization does. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxesr6sy2hhbg79jyy4jc7wy))

	- I have to confess that the information most useful to me, and I suspect most useful to all managers, comes from quick, often casual verbal exchanges.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxet9a6nm1yjc7473dt6jn2a))
	- So why are written reports necessary at all? They obviously can’t provide timely information. What they do is constitute an archive of data, help to validate ad hoc inputs, and catch, in safety-net fashion, anything you may have missed. But reports also have another totally different function. As they are formulated and written, the author is forced to be more precise than he might be verbally. Hence their value stems from the discipline and the thinking the writer is forced to impose upon himself as he identifies and deals with trouble spots in his presentation. Reports are more a *medium* of *self-discipline* than a way to communicate information. *Writing* the report is important; reading it often is not.

	- As can be seen from my schedule, a manager not only gathers information but is also a source of it. He must convey his knowledge to members of his own organization and to other groups he influences. Beyond relaying facts, a manager must also communicate his objectives, priorities, and preferences as they bear on the way certain tasks are approached. This is extremely important, because only if the manager imparts these will his subordinates know how to make decisions themselves that will be acceptable to the manager, their supervisor. Thus, transmitting objectives and preferred approaches constitutes a key to successful delegation. As we will see later, a shared corporate culture becomes indispensable to a business. Someone adhering to the values of a corporate culture—an intelligent corporate citizen—will behave in consistent fashion under similar conditions, which means that managers don’t have to suffer the inefficiencies engendered by formal rules, procedures, and regulations that are sometimes used to get the same result. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxev0ryxz7jejnwap7tcrcf7))
	- Just how decisions should be made, we’ll talk about later. Meanwhile, let’s say that decisions can be separated into two kinds. The forward-looking sort are made, for example, in the capital authorization process. Here we allocate the financial resources of the company among various future undertakings. The second type is made as we respond to a developing problem or a crisis, which can either be technical (a quality control problem, for example) or involve people (talking somebody out of quitting) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxev7f25021mjrcvbha15qqq))

	- All managers need to act so that they can be seen exerting influence, but they should do so in their own way. Some of us feel comfortable dealing with large groups and talking about our feelings and values openly in that fashion. Others prefer working one-on-one with people in a quieter, more intellectual environment. These and other styles of leadership will work, but only if we recognize and consciously stress the need for us to be role models for people in our organization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpbrzwt05p7qbbkmwyrhnqk))
	- A great deal of a manager’s work has to do with allocating resources: manpower, money, and capital. But the single most important resource that we allocate from one day to the next is our own time. In principle more money, more manpower, or more capital can always be made available, but our own time is the one absolutely finite resource we each have. Its allocation and use therefore deserve considerable attention. How you handle your own time is, in my view, the single most important aspect of being a role model and leader.

	- *Leverage of Managerial Activity*
	  
	  We’ve established that the output of a manager is the output of the various organizations under his control and his influence. What can a manager do to increase his output? To find out, let’s look at the concept of *leverage.* Leverage is the measure of the output generated by any given managerial activity. Accordingly, managerial output can be linked to managerial activity by the equation:
	  
	  Managerial Output = Output of organization = L1 × A1 + L2 × A2 +…
	  
	  This equation says that for every activity a manager performs—A1, A2, and so on—the output of the organization should increase by some degree. The extent to which that output is thereby increased is determined by the leverage of that activity—L1, L2, and so on. A manager’s output is thus the sum of the result of individual activities having varying degrees of leverage. Clearly the key to high output means being sensitive to the *leverage* of what you do during the day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpbydcjyx925eqew628ah7v))
	- Managerial productivity—that is, the output of a manager per unit of time worked—can be increased in three ways:
	  
	  > 1.  Increasing the rate with which a manager performs his activities, speeding up his work.
	  > 
	  > 2.  Increasing the leverage associated with the various managerial activities.
	  > 
	  > 3.  Shifting the mix of a manager’s activities from those with lower to those with higher leverage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpbytpjxz183ksqcxme8ff4))
	- HIGH-LEVERAGE ACTIVITIES
	  
	  These can be achieved in three basic ways:
	  
	  > •  When many people are affected by one manager.
	  > 
	  > •  When a person’s activity or behavior over a long period of time is affected by a manager’s brief, well-focused set of words or actions.
	  > 
	  > •  When a large group’s work is affected by an individual supplying a unique, key piece of knowledge or information. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpbz6vjnrp30jygc0vg3vmb))
	- *Managerial meddling* is also an example of negative leverage. This occurs when a supervisor uses his superior knowledge and experience of a subordinate’s responsibilities to assume command of a situation rather than letting the subordinate work things through himself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpc25shwwjb9287g32gcg4c))
	- The third kind of managerial activity with high leverage is exercised by a person with *unique skills* and *knowledge.* One such person is an Intel marketing engineer responsible for setting prices for the product line ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpc2q7r911df8gcpqc4z7m2))
	- delegation without follow-through is *abdication.* You can never wash your hands of a task. Even after you delegate it, you are still responsible for its accomplishment, and monitoring the delegated task is the only practical way for you to ensure a result. Monitoring is not meddling, but means checking to make sure an activity is proceeding in line with expectations. Because it is easier to monitor something with which you are familiar, if you have a choice you should delegate those activities you know best ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpc8p76mkkdbxcv5yb0hnrz))
	- Monitoring the results of delegation resembles the monitoring used in quality assurance. We should apply quality assurance principles and monitor at the lowest-added-value stage of the process. For example, review *rough drafts* of reports that you have delegated; don’t wait until your subordinates have spent time polishing them into final form before you find out that you have a basic problem with the contents. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpca7axrv1cfdw6v3wf8j0s))
	- To use quality assurance principles effectively, the manager should only go into details randomly, just enough to try to ensure that the subordinate is moving ahead satisfactorily. To check into *all* the details of a delegated task would be like quality assurance testing 100 percent of what manufacturing turned out. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpcbd4hb5eptvrcjczq1hhe))
	- *Increasing Managerial Activity Rate: Speeding Up the Line*
	  
	  Of course, the most obvious way to increase managerial output is to increase the *rate,* or speed, of performing work. The relationship here is:
		- ![](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/reader/parsed_document_assets/45288898/id16-00014.jpeg)![](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/reader/parsed_document_assets/45288898/id16-00014_Jjs7HGC.jpeg)
		  
		  where L is the leverage of the activity.
		  
		  The most common approach to increasing a manager’s productivity—his output over time—has been time-management techniques, which try to reduce the denominator on both sides of this equation. Any number of consultants will tell a manager that the way to higher productivity is to handle a piece of paper only once, to hold only stand-up meetings (which will presumably be short), and to turn his desk so that he presents his back to the door. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpcg20mytf057mjf30rsmgz))
	- A second production principle we can apply to managerial work is *batching* similar tasks. Any manufacturing operation requires a certain amount of set-up time. So for managerial work to proceed efficiently, we should use the same set-up effort to apply across a group of similar activities ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpcr7bat74gxz9jkfw1ekvt))
	- Set-up time has many parallels in managerial work. For example, once we have prepared a set of illustrations for a training class, we will obviously increase our productivity if we can use the same set over and over again with other classes or groups. Similarly, if a manager has a number of reports to read or a number of performance reviews to approve, he should set aside a block of time and do a batch of them together, one after the other, to maximize the use of the *mental* set-up time needed for the task. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpcrsqr906r1tg82eskgb3q))
	- From my experience a large portion of managerial work *can be* forecasted. Accordingly, forecasting those things you can and setting yourself up to do them is only common sense and an important way to minimize the feeling and the reality of fragmentation experienced in managerial work. Forecasting and planning your time around key events are literally like running an efficient factory ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpcsvh0r571vqamy06hqxrr))
	- To use your calendar as a production-planning tool, you must accept responsibility for two things:
	  
	  > 1.  You should move toward the *active* use of your calendar, taking the initiative to fill the holes between the time-critical events with non-time-critical though necessary activities.
	  > 
	  > 2.  You should say “no” at the outset to work beyond your capacity to handle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpcvm0zhgz1qd1qy2x2jaw9))
	- The next production principle you can apply is to allow *slack*—a bit of looseness in your scheduling ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpcwc0sbgsnhvzd33xqcxp6))
	- Another production principle is very nearly the opposite. A manager should carry a raw material *inventory* in terms of projects. This is not to be confused with his work-in-process inventory, because that, like eggs in a continuous boiler, tends to spoil or become obsolete over time. Instead this inventory should consist of things you need to do but don’t need to finish right away—discretionary projects, the kind the manager can work on to increase his group’s productivity over the long term. Without such an inventory of projects, a manager will most probably use his free time *meddling* in his subordinates’ work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpcxh5z8htxsc1xfdp6v9yf))
	- As we become more consistent, we should also remember that the value of an administrative procedure is contained not in formal statements but in the real thinking that led to its establishment. This means that even as we try to standardize what we do, we should continue to think critically about what we do and the approaches we use ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpcy4wvw4twfm2ab8rqfnt2))
	- *Built-In Leverage: How Many Subordinates Should You Have*…
	  
	  An important component of managerial leverage is the number of subordinates a manager has. If he does not have enough, his leverage is obviously reduced. If he has too many, he gets bogged down—with the same result. As a rule of thumb, a manager whose work is largely supervisory should have six to eight subordinates; three or four are too few and ten are too many. This range comes from a guideline that a manager should allocate about a half day per week to each of his subordinates. (Two days a week per subordinate would probably lead to meddling; an hour a week does not provide enough opportunity for monitoring.)
	  
	  The six to eight rule is right for the classically hierarchical manager whose primary work is the supervision of others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpda93et5dqxrzcm73j4psr))
	- Thus I will assert again that a meeting is nothing less than the *medium* through which managerial work is performed. That means we should not be fighting their very existence, but rather using the time spent in them as efficiently as possible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpeh5mes0wb291ppc1y7dhe))
	- The two basic managerial roles produce two basic kinds of meetings. In the first kind of meeting, called a *process-oriented* meeting, knowledge is shared and *information* is exchanged. Such meetings take place on a regularly scheduled basis. The purpose of the second kind of meeting is to solve a specific problem. Meetings of this sort, called *mission-oriented,* frequently produce a *decision.* They are ad hoc affairs, not scheduled long in advance, because they usually can’t be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpehsb7f3mxt8t08qmgy688))
	- How long should a one-on-one meeting last? There really is no answer to this, but the subordinate must feel that there is enough time to broach and get into thorny issues ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpeswwd35xb9mz9jypt6zaj))
	- Where should a one-on-one take place? In the supervisor’s office, in the subordinate’s office, or somewhere else? I think you should have the meeting in or near the subordinate’s work area if possible. A supervisor can learn a lot simply by going to his subordinate’s office. Is he organized or not? Does he repeatedly have to spend time looking for a document he wants? Does he get interrupted all the time? Never? And in general, how does the subordinate approach his work?
	  
	  A key point about a one-on-one: It should be regarded as the *subordinate’s* meeting, with its agenda and tone set by him. There’s good reason for this. Somebody needs to prepare for the meeting. The supervisor with eight subordinates would have to prepare eight times; the subordinate only once. So the latter should be asked to prepare an outline, which is very important because it forces him to think through in advance all of the issues and points he plans to raise. Moreover, with an outline, the supervisor knows at the outset what is to be covered and can therefore help to set the pace of the meeting according to the “meatiness” of the items on the agenda. An outline also provides a framework for supporting information, which the subordinate should prepare in advance. The subordinate should then walk the supervisor through all the material ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpesgkzva772y5bp78j9xqp))
	- What should be covered in a one-on-one? We can start with performance figures, indicators used by the subordinate, such as incoming order rates, production output, or project status. Emphasis should be on indicators that signal trouble. The meeting should also cover anything important that has happened since the last meeting: current hiring problems, people problems in general, organizational problems and future plans, and—very, very important—*potential* problems. Even when a problem isn’t tangible, even if it’s only an intuition that something’s wrong, a subordinate owes it to his supervisor to tell him, because it triggers a look into the organizational black box. The most important criterion governing matters to be talked about is that they be issues that preoccupy and nag the subordinate. These are often obscure and take time to surface, consider, and resolve. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpevkw02k9pzpd94k1836nh))
	- How is this done? By applying Grove’s Principle of Didactic Management, *“Ask one more question!”* When the supervisor thinks the subordinate has said all he wants to about a subject, he should ask another question. He should try to keep the flow of thoughts coming by prompting the subordinate with queries until *both* feel satisfied that they have gotten to the bottom of a problem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpfjsz2za0xjpfj29fyv9a7))
	- I’d like to suggest some mechanical hints for effective one-on-one meetings. First, both the supervisor and subordinate should have a copy of the outline and both should take notes on it, which serves a number of purposes. I take notes in just about all circumstances, and most often end up never looking at them again. I do it to keep my mind from drifting and also to help me digest the information I hear and see. Since I take notes in outline form, I am forced to categorize the information logically, which helps me to absorb it. Equally important is what “writing it down” symbolizes. Many issues in a one-on-one lead to action required on the part of the subordinate. When he takes a note immediately following the supervisor’s suggestion, the act implies a commitment, like a handshake, that something will be done. The supervisor, also having taken notes, can then follow up at the next one-on-one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpfk5r76j38eydbdcs4n5jn))
	- A real time-saver is using a “hold” file where both the supervisor and subordinate accumulate important but not altogether urgent issues for discussion at the next meeting. This kind of file applies the production principle of batching and saves time for both involved by minimizing the need for ad hoc contact—like phone calls, drop-in visits, and so on—which constitute the interruptions we considered earlier.

	- *Mission-Oriented Meetings*
	  
	  Unlike a process-oriented meeting, which is a regularly scheduled affair held to exchange knowledge and information, the mission-oriented meeting is usually held ad hoc and is designed to produce a specific output, frequently a decision. The key to success here is what the *chairman* does ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpfy0msfqdrk1ssawkmnht1))
	- Thus the chairman must have a clear understanding of the meeting’s objective—what needs to happen and what decision has to be made. The absolute truth is that if you don’t know what you want, you won’t get it. So before calling a meeting, ask yourself: What am I trying to accomplish? Then ask, is a meeting necessary? Or desirable? Or justifiable? Don’t call a meeting if all the answers aren’t yes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpfyd4n0tqgxpcp8944c349))
	- Assuming the meeting does need to be held, the chairman faces a set of obligations. The first one has to do with attendance. As the chairman, you must identify who should attend and then try to get those people to come. It is not enough to ask people and hope for the best; you need to follow up and get commitments. If someone invited can’t make it himself, see to it that he sends a person with the power to speak for him. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxpfz3hb0gdc1xza6274k2s3))

	- Once the meeting is over, the chairman must nail down exactly what happened by sending out minutes that summarize the discussion that occurred, the decision made, and the actions to be taken. And it’s very important that attendees get the minutes quickly, before they forget what happened. The minutes should also be as clear and as specific as possible, telling the reader what is to be done, who is to do it, and when ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxq4twn4dy21bpx961mbwxjv))

	- Illustrated on [this page](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/45288898#c05_01) is an ideal model of decision-making in a know-how business.

	- The ideal decision-making process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxq527wpcy8rj9vffyxw9vq8))
	- The next stage is reaching a *clear decision.* Again, the greater the disagreement about the issue, the more important becomes the word *clear.* In fact, particular pains should be taken to frame the terms of the decision with utter clarity. Again, our tendency is to do just the opposite: when we know a decision is controversial we want to obscure matters to avoid an argument. But the argument is not avoided by our being mealy-mouthed, merely postponed. People who don’t like a decision will be a lot madder if they don’t get a prompt and straight story about it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxq52zp1end817fhb7s06trm))
	- Finally, everyone involved must give the decision reached by the group *full support.* This does not necessarily mean agreement: so long as the participants commit to back the decision, that is a satisfactory outcome. Many people have trouble supporting a decision with which they do not agree, but that they need to do so is simply inevitable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxq53g2h584rdpx0b3nhec07))
	- But an organization does not live by its members agreeing with one another at all times about everything. It lives instead by people committing to support the decisions and the moves of the business. All a manager can expect is that the commitment to support is honestly present, and this is something he can and must get from everyone ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxq540hwnpsefng8pddvm1fa))
	- My answer was that this is not affectation but a matter of survival. In our business we have to mix knowledge-power people with position-power people daily, and together they make decisions that could affect us for years to come. If we don’t link our engineers with our managers in such a way as to get good decisions, we can’t succeed in our industry. Now, status symbols most certainly do not promote the flow of ideas, facts, and points of view. What appears to be a matter of style really is a matter of necessity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxq5pwbrcbsh6xm4k6wtreah))
	- One thing that paralyzes both knowledge and position power possessors is the fear of simply *sounding dumb.* For the senior person, this is likely to keep him from asking the questions he should ask. The same fear will make other participants merely think their thoughts privately rather than articulate them for all to hear; at best they will whisper what they have to say to a neighbor. As a manager, you should remind yourself that each time an insight or fact is withheld and an appropriate question is suppressed, the decision-making process is less good than it might have been. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxq5xepc087nqnh9b9jq9f34))
	- A related phenomenon influences lower-level people present in the meeting. This group has to overcome the fear of being *overruled,* which might mean embarrassment: if the rest of the group or a senior-level manager vetoed a junior person or opposed a position he was advocating, the junior manager might lose face in front of his peers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxq5y77ja9mx9qjm6jnqj1j7))
	- If you either enter the decision-making stage too early or wait too long, you won’t derive the full benefit of open discussion. The criterion to follow is this: don’t push for a decision prematurely. Make sure you have heard and considered the real issues rather than the superficial comments that often dominate the early part of a meeting. But if you feel that you have already heard everything, that all sides of the issue have been raised, it is time to push for a consensus—and failing that, to step in and make a decision. Sometimes free discussion goes on in an unending search for consensus. But, if that happens, people can drift away from the near consensus when they are close to being right, diminishing the chances of reaching the correct decision. So moving on to make the decision at the right time is crucial ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxq60aq2p2p4wgh2abafavxc))

	- One last thing. If the final word has to be dramatically different from the expectations of the people who participated in the decision-making process (had I chosen, for example, to cancel the Philippine plant project altogether), make your announcement but don’t just walk away from the issue. People need time to adjust, rationalize, and in general put their heads back together. Adjourn, reconvene the meeting after people have had a chance to recover, and solicit their views of the decision at that time. This will help everybody accept and learn to live with the unexpected. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxra954ygbbxf7d36ereqhfa))
	- If good decision-making appears complicated, that’s because it is and has been for a long time. Let me quote from Alfred Sloan, who spent a lifetime preoccupied with decision-making: “Group decisions do not always come easily. There is a strong temptation for the leading officers to make decisions themselves without the sometimes onerous process of discussion.” Because the process is indeed onerous, people sometimes try to run away from it. A middle manager I once knew came straight from one of the better business schools and possessed what we might call a “John Wayne” mentality. Having become frustrated with the way Intel made decisions, he quit. He joined a company where his employers assured him during the interview that people were encouraged to make individual decisions which they were then free to implement. Four months later, he came back to Intel. He explained that if he could make decisions without consulting anybody, so could everybody else.

	- Planning: Today’s Actions for Tomorrow’s Output
	  
	  *The Planning Process* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxre805sz3ymw020n0t4p3v4))
	- Your general planning process should consist of analogous thinking. Step 1 is to establish projected need or demand: What will the environment demand from you, your business, or your organization? Step 2 is to establish your present status: What are you producing now? What will you be producing as your projects in the pipeline are completed? Put another way, where will your business be if you do nothing different from what you are now doing? Step 3 is to compare and reconcile steps 1 and 2. Namely, what more (or less) do you need to do to produce what your environment will demand? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxre97mt5j1cfxqjk3kmhnxp))
	- What should you look for when you examine your environment? You should attempt to determine your customers’ expectations and their perception of your performance. You should keep abreast of technological developments like electronic mail and other alternative ways of doing your job. You should evaluate the performance of your vendors. You should also evaluate the performance of other groups in the organization to which you belong. Does some other group (like the traffic department) affect how well you can do your work? Can that group meet your needs? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxrekqqs6jhw2hffmxwxgn65))
	- Once you have established what constitutes your environment, you need to examine it in two time frames—now, and sometime in the future, let’s say in a year. The questions then become: What do my customers want from me now? Am I satisfying them? What will they expect from me one year from now? You need to focus on the difference between what your environment demands from you now and what you expect it to demand from you a year from now. Such a *difference analysis* is crucial, because if your current activities satisfy the current demands placed on your business, anything more and new should be undertaken to match this difference. How you *react* to this difference is in fact the key outcome of the planning process ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxreme1zx083e9bvffck467k))
	- STEP 2—PRESENT STATUS
	  
	  The second step of planning is to determine your present status. You do this by listing your present capabilities and the projects you have in the works. As you account for them, be sure to use the same terms, or “currency,” in which you stated demand. For instance, if your demand is listed in terms of completed product designs, your work-in-process should be listed as partially completed product designs. You also need to look at timing; namely, when will these projects come out of your “pipeline”? You must ask yourself, will every project now moving through be completed? Chances are, no, some will get scrapped or aborted, and you have to factor this into your forecasted output. Statistically, in semiconductor manufacturing, only some 80 percent of the material started actually gets finished. Similarly, while it is impossible to be precise in every case, it is prudent to factor in some percentage of loss for managerial projects as well ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxres22ehh8362s9zxsvw54p))
	- STEP 3—WHAT TO DO TO CLOSE THE GAP
	  
	  The final step of planning consists of undertaking new tasks or modifying old ones to close the gap between your environmental demand and what your present activities will yield. The first question is, What do you *need* to do to close the gap? The second is, What *can* you do to close the gap? Consider each question separately, and then decide what you actually will do, evaluating *what* effect your actions will have on narrowing the gap, and *when.* The set of actions you decide upon is your *strategy.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxrgch9bnnhe75c4tqswgtw5))
	- Much confusion exists between what is strategy and what is tactics. Although the distinction is rarely of practical significance, here’s one that might be useful. As you formulate in words what you plan to do, the most abstract and general summary of those actions meaningful to you is your strategy. What you’ll do to implement the strategy is your tactics. Frequently, a strategy at one managerial level is the tactical concern of the next higher level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxrgd1yd6zea2h4gzf38dzej))

	- *The Output of the Planning Process*
	  
	  The key to both Bruce’s and Cindy’s efforts is that their planning produced tasks that had to be performed *now* in order to affect *future* events. I have seen far too many people who upon recognizing today’s gap try very hard to determine what decision has to be made to close it. But today’s gap represents a failure of planning sometime in the past. By analogy, forcing ourselves to concentrate on the decisions needed to fix today’s problem is like scurrying after our car has already run out of gas. Clearly we should have filled up earlier. To avoid such a fate, remember that as you plan you must answer the question: What do I have to do *today* to solve—or better, avoid—*tomorrow’s* problem? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxrhztn7842yn90k4zp4kjkw))
	- Thus, the true output of the planning process is the set of tasks it causes to be implemented ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxrk7b0wr8c6z0ysp25f4svn))
	- In other words, the output of the planning process is the *decisions* made and the *actions* taken as a result of the process ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxrk7f3pgy0mcfzjdxgyctxd))
	- How far ahead should the planners look? At Intel, we put ourselves through an annual strategic long-range planning effort in which we examine our future five years off. But what is really being influenced here? It is the *next year*—and only the next year. We will have another chance to replan the second of the five years in the next year’s long-range planning meeting, when that year will become the first year of the five. So, keep in mind that you implement only that portion of a plan that lies within the time window between now and the next time you go through the exercise. Everything else you can look at again. We should also be careful not to plan too frequently, allowing ourselves time to judge the impact of the decisions we made and to determine whether our decisions were on the right track or not. In other words, we need the feedback that will be indispensable to our planning the next time around. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxrk8g3ssa5y604ek5g9bgsb))

	- Finally, remember that by saying “yes”—to projects, a course of action, or whatever—you are implicitly saying “no” to something else. Each time you make a commitment, you forfeit your chance to commit to something else. This, of course, is an inevitable, inescapable consequence of allocating any finite resource. People who plan have to have the guts, honesty, and discipline to drop projects as well as to initiate them, to shake their heads “no” as well as to smile “yes.

	- *Management by Objectives: The Planning Process Applied to Daily Work*
	  
	  The system of management by objectives assumes that because our concerns here are short-range, we should know quite well what our environment demands from us. Thus, management by objectives—MBO—concentrates on steps 2 and 3 of the planning process and tries very hard to make them specific. The idea behind MBO is extremely simple: If you don’t know where you’re going, you will not get there. Or, as an old Indian saying puts it, “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.”
	  
	  A successful MBO system needs only to answer two questions:
	  
	  > 1.  Where do I want to go? (The answer provides the *objective.*)
	  > 
	  > 2.  How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or *key results.*) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxrx9mrh42qwzf1v8t7d6bm3))
	- MBO is largely designed to provide feedback relevant to the specific task at hand; it should tell us *how* we are doing so we can make adjustments in *whatever* we are doing if need be ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxrybe76jem03j2qek2ewd3q))
	- For the feedback to be effective, it must be received very soon after the activity it is measuring occurs. Accordingly, an MBO system should set objectives for a relatively short period. For example, if we plan on a yearly basis, the corresponding MBO system’s time frame should be at least as often as quarterly or perhaps even monthly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxrybrrpbqqed7gfpkhrf5xm))
	- The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. In practice, this is rare, and here, as elsewhere, we fall victim to our inability to say “no”—in this case, to too many objectives. We must realize—and act on the realization—that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. A few extremely well-chosen objectives impart a clear message about what we say “yes” to and what we say “no” to—which is what we must have if an MBO system is to work.

	- The MBO system is meant to pace a person—to put a stopwatch in his own hand so he can gauge his own performance. It is not a legal document upon which to base a performance review, but should be just one input used to determine how well an individual is doing. If the supervisor mechanically relies on the MBO system to evaluate his subordinate’s performance, or if the subordinate uses it rigidly and forgoes taking advantage of an emerging opportunity because it was not a specified objective or key result, then both are behaving in a petty and unprofessional fashion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvhks5xvk67nwyyzcmxmjvm))
	- Earlier, we established the fact that the game of management is a team game: a manager’s output is the output of the organizations under his supervision or influence. We now discover that management is not just a team game, it is a game in which we have to fashion a team of teams, where the various individual teams exist in some suitable and mutually supportive relationship with each other.

	- Though most are mixed, organizations can come in two extreme forms: in totally *mission-oriented* form or in totally *functional* form. The Breakfast Factory Corporation could be organized in one or the other extreme form, as shown on the next page. In the mission-oriented organization (a), which is completely decentralized, each individual business unit pursues what it does—its mission—with little tie-in to other units. Here, each Breakfast Factory is responsible for all elements of its operation: determining its own location and constructing its own building, doing its own merchandising, acquiring and maintaining its own personnel, and doing its own purchasing. In the end it submits monthly financial statements to the corporate executive office. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvje3bn8dxbydwjvjvwes4w))

	- The desire to give the individual branch manager the power to respond to local conditions moves us toward a mission-oriented organization. But a similarly legitimate desire to take advantage of the obvious economies of scale and to increase the leverage of the expertise we have in each operational area across the entire corporation would push us toward a functional organization. In the real world, of course, we look for a compromise between the two extremes. In fact, the search for the appropriate compromise has preoccupied managers for a long, long time. Alfred Sloan summed up decades of experience at General Motors by saying, “Good management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization.” Or, we might say, on a balancing act to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxvjwxbn9bj1wynxz2s7eyz6))
	- Let’s now look at Intel’s organization form, as shown on the next page. We are a *hybrid* organization. Our hybrid nature comes from the fact that the form of the overall corporate organization results from a mix of the business divisions, which are mission-oriented, and the functional groups. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxwd61szgaesqe176e4yk2f6))
	- The business divisions are analogous to individual fighting units, which are provided with blankets, paychecks, aerial surveillance, intelligence, and so forth by the functional organizations, which supply such services to all fighting units. Because each such unit does not have to maintain its own support groups, it can concentrate on a specific mission, like taking a hill in a battle. And for that, each unit has all the necessary freedom of action and independence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxwd6hgq9y4r0chhn2vhqd5q))
	- The functional groups can be viewed as if they were internal subcontractors. Let’s take a sales organization as an example. Though a lot of companies use outside sales representatives, an internal group presumably provides the service at less expense and with greater responsiveness. Likewise, manufacturing, finance, or data processing can all be regarded as functional groups, which, as internal subcontractors, provide services to all the business units ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxwd7a5ddxet4tz5v79gtee2))

	- Some two thirds of Intel’s employees work in the functional units, indicating their enormous importance. What are some of the advantages of organizing so much of the company in such groups? The first is the economies of scale that can be achieved ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxwdmfzyn9nf45hn86p7ms0p))
	- Another important advantage is that resources can be shifted and reallocated to respond to changes in corporate-wide priorities. For instance, because manufacturing is organized functionally, we can change the mix of product being made to match need as perceived by the entire corporation. If each business unit did its own manufacturing, shifting capacity away from one unit to another would be a cumbersome and sticky exercise. And the advantage here is that the expertise of specialists—know-how managers, such as the research engineers who work in technology development—can be applied across the breadth of the entire corporation, giving their knowledge and work enormous leverage. Finally, Intel’s functional groups allow the business units to concentrate on mastering their specific trades rather than having to worry about computers, production, technology, and so forth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxwdngqhehcqg4px94ezyhk9))
	- Having so much of Intel organized in functional units also has its disadvantages. The most important is the information overload hitting a functional group when it must respond to the demands made on it by diverse and numerous business units. Even conveying needs and demands often becomes very difficult—a business unit has to go through a number of management layers to influence decision-making in a functional group. Nowhere is this more evident than in the negotiations that go on to secure a portion of centralized—and limited—resources of the corporation, be it production capacity, computer time, or space in a shared building. Indeed, things often move beyond negotiation to intense and open competition among business units for the resources controlled by the functional groups. The bottom line here is that both the negotiation and competition waste time and energy because neither contributes to the output or the general good of the company. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxwdpgcqrdavyjr2440kdnz2))
	- What are some of the advantages of organizing much of a company in a mission-oriented form? There is only one. It is that the individual units can stay in touch with the needs of their business or product areas and initiate changes rapidly when those needs change. *That is it.* All other considerations favor the functional-type of organization. But the business of any business is to respond to the demands and needs of its environment, and the need to be responsive is so important that it always leads to much of any organization being grouped in mission-oriented units.

	- In our business culture, the allocation of shared resources and the reconciliation of the conflicting needs and desires of the independent business units are theoretically the function of corporate management.

	- Instead, the answer lies with middle managers. Within a company, they are, in the first place, numerous enough to cover the entire range of operation; and, in the second place, very close to the problem we’re talking about—namely, generating internal resources and consuming those resources. For middle managers to succeed at this high-leverage task, two things are necessary. First, they must accept the inevitability of the hybrid organizational form if they are to serve its workings. Second, they must develop and master the practice through which a hybrid organization can be managed. This is *dual reporting,* the subject of our next chapter ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxwf0gbd9q8sfjjxtb6qwt4y))
	- Dual Reporting
	  
	  To put a man on the moon, NASA asked several major contractors and many subcontractors to work together, each on a different aspect of the project. An unintended consequence of the moon shot was the development of a new organizational approach: *matrix management.* This provided the means through which the work of various contractors could be coordinated and managed so that if problems developed in one place, they did not subvert the entire schedule. Resources could be diverted, for example, from a strong organization to one that was slipping in order to help the latter make up lost time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxwf1bq8s3swawvq4zdmcq6y))
	- Matrix management is a complicated affair. Books have been written about it and entire courses of instruction devoted to it.

	- The point is that a strong and positive corporate culture is absolutely essential if dual reporting and decision-making by peers are to work.
	  
	  This system makes a manager’s life ambiguous, and most people don’t like ambiguity. Nevertheless, the system is needed to make hybrid organizations work, and while people will strive to find something simpler, the reality is that it doesn’t exist. A strictly functional organization, which is clear conceptually, tends to remove engineering and manufacturing (or the equivalent groups in your firm) from the marketplace, leaving them with no idea of what the customers want. A highly mission-oriented organization, in turn, may have definite crisp reporting relationships and clear and unambiguous objectives at all times. However, the fragmented state of affairs that results causes inefficiency and poor overall performance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy00x8jxtejx831crv7hthrq))
	- It’s not because Intel loved ambiguity that we became a hybrid organization. We have tried everything else, and while other models may have been less ambiguous, they simply didn’t work. Hybrid organizations and the accompanying dual reporting principle, like a democracy, are not great in and of themselves. They just happen to be the best way for any business to be organized.

	- *Making Hybrid Organizations Work*
	  
	  To make hybrid organizations work, you need a way to coordinate the mission-oriented units and the functional groups so that the resources of the latter are allocated and delivered to meet the needs of the former. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy00yhyt6fgf6412kc6xvc2c))

	- As with much else in a hybrid organization, the optimum solution here calls for the use of dual reporting. The divisional marketing managers should control most of their own advertising messages. But a coordinating body of peers consisting of the various divisional marketing managers and perhaps chaired by the corporate merchandising manager should provide the necessary functional supervision for all involved ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0ckm9pkfhyxtktmv1w345x))
	- Dual reporting can certainly tax the patience of the marketing managers, as they are now also required to understand the needs and thought processes of their peers. But no real alternative exists when you need to communicate individual product and market messages and maintain a corporate identity at the same time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0cm3hpv55kjzhntqw2xzp8))
	- The point is that the two- (or multi-) plane organization is very useful. Without it I could only participate if I were in charge of everything I was part of. I don’t have that kind of time, and often I’m not the most qualified person around to lead. The multi-plane organization enables me to serve as a foot soldier rather than as a general when appropriate and useful. This gives the organization important flexibility. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0dgyg31f0jp6xnvj2gpqt4))
	- Similarly, our behavior in a work environment can be controlled by three invisible and pervasive means. These are:
	  
	  > •  free-market forces
	  > 
	  > •  contractual obligations
	  > 
	  > •  cultural values ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0dm1mkke88gnw8jayhezrp))
	- *Free-Market Forces*
	  
	  When you bought your tires, your actions were governed by free-market forces, which are based on price: goods and services are being exchanged between two entities (individuals, organizational units, or corporations), with each seeking only to enrich himself or itself. This is very simple. It is a matter of “I want to buy the tire at the lowest price I can get” versus “I want to sell the tire at the highest price I can get.” Neither party here cares if the other goes bankrupt, nor do they pretend to. This is a very efficient way to buy and sell tires. No one is needed to oversee the transaction because everyone is openly serving his own self-interest. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0dn1xp67ajjepbkxpxm81m))
	- So why aren’t the forces of the marketplace used all the time in all circumstances? Because to work, the goods and services bought and sold must possess a very clearly defined dollar value. The free market can easily establish a price for something as simple as tires. But for much else that changes hands in a work or business environment, value is hard to establish. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0dnf16h6qrykttc1h66hn2))
	- Contractual Obligations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0dqxmz1c473xp22s6254yj))
	- The nature of control is now based on contractual obligations, which define the kind of work you will do and the standards that will govern it. Because I can’t specify in advance exactly what you will do from day to day, I must have a fair amount of generalized authority over your work. So you must give to me as part of the contract the right to monitor and evaluate and, if necessary, correct your work. We agree on other guidelines and work out rules that we will both obey. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0drvb3zgjh8eykpfh034pq))
	- In return for stopping at a red light, we count on other drivers to do the same thing, and we can drive through green lights. But for lawbreakers we need policemen, and with them, as with supervisors, we introduce *overhead* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0dsqh1r3vd03qek3v09rdx))
	- *Cultural Values*
	  
	  When the environment changes more rapidly than one can change rules, or when a set of circumstances is so ambiguous and unclear that a contract between the parties that attempted to cover all possibilities would be prohibitively complicated, we need another mode of control, which is based on cultural values. Its most important characteristic is that the interest of the larger group to which an individual belongs takes precedence over the interest of the individual himself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0dts3h1whs544ar1f3ctwb))
	- When such values are at work, some emotionally loaded words come into play—words like *trust*—because you are surrendering to the group your ability to protect yourself. And for this to happen, you must believe that you all share a common set of *values,* a common set of *objectives,* and a common set of *methods.* These, in turn, can only be developed by a great deal of common, shared experience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0dv560qj7089py964f0hdn))
	- *The Role of Management*
	  
	  You don’t need management to supervise the workings of free-market forces; no one supervises sales made at a flea market. In a contractual obligation, management has a role in setting and modifying the rules, monitoring adherence to them, and evaluating and improving performance. As for cultural values, management has to develop and nurture the common set of values, objectives, and methods essential for the existence of trust. How do we do that? One way is by *articulation,* by spelling out these values, objectives, and methods. The other, even more important, way is by *example.* If our behavior at work will be regarded as in line with the values we profess, that fosters the development of a group culture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0dzc01ghtar4nsfk0wqqfc))
	- *The Most Appropriate Mode of Control*
	  
	  There is a temptation to idealize what I’ve called cultural values as a mode of control because it is so “nice,” even utopian, because everybody presumably cares about the common good and subjugates self-interest to that common good. But this is not the most efficient mode of control under all conditions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0e298tad149s1vnmk6ed3h))
	- Accordingly, given a certain set of conditions, there is always a *most appropriate* mode of control, which we as managers should find and use.
	  
	  How do we do that? There are two variables here: first, the nature of a person’s motivation; and second, the nature of the environment in which he works. An imaginary composite index can be applied to measure an environment’s complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity, which we’ll call the *CUA factor.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0e2jfdr138jd476k5rte7k))

	- It is our task as managers to identify which mode of control is most appropriate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0e1h4ej2bhm616syq5tyqa))
	- Put another way, this means that management is a team activity. But no matter how well a team is put together, no matter how well it is directed, the team will perform only as well as the individuals on it. In other words, everything we’ve considered so far is useless unless the members of our team will continually try to offer the best they can do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0evct5q3z9g30q1ebx969j))
	- When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can’t do it or won’t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated. To determine which, we can employ a simple mental test: if the person’s life depended on doing the work, could he do it? If the answer is yes, that person is not motivated; if the answer is no, he is not capable. If my life depended on playing the violin on command, I could not do it. But if I had to run a mile in six minutes, I probably could. Not that I would want to, but if my life depended on it, I probably could ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0ew0cv5wjdvgxts7wxb4b9))
	- The single most important task of a manager is to elicit peak performance from his subordinates. So if two things limit high output, a manager has two ways to tackle the issue: through *training* and *motivation.* Each, as we see in the next figure, can improve a person’s performance. In this chapter, our concern is motivation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0ewm6sda4c95m2vsazmrez))
	- ![](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/reader/parsed_document_assets/45288898/id26-00024_EGJOpqk.jpeg) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0ex5dt4yb2v6twkrj4hp63))
	- A manager has two ways to improve performance: training and motivation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0exa0f16kkbg9b1da8wfz9))
	- In an MBO system, for example, objectives should be set at a point high enough so that even if the individual (or organization) pushes himself hard, he will still only have a fifty-fifty chance of making them. Output will tend to be greater when everybody strives for a level of achievement beyond his immediate grasp, even though trying means failure half the time. Such goal-setting is extremely important if what you want is peak performance from yourself and your subordinates ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0fbwmkyvjqfkrjempvnk53))
	- Moreover, if we want to cultivate achievement-driven motivation, we need to create an environment that values and emphasizes *output.* My first job was with a research and development laboratory, where a lot of people were very highly motivated but tended to be knowledge-centered. They were driven to know more, but not necessarily to know more in order to produce concrete results. Consequently, relatively little was actually *achieved.* The value system at Intel is completely the reverse. The Ph.D. in computer science who knows an answer in the abstract, yet does not apply it to create some tangible output, gets little recognition, but a junior engineer who produces results is highly valued and esteemed. And that is how it should be ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0fck4pcstdstk74egfyyaq))
	- What are some of the feedback mechanisms or measures in the workplace? The most appropriate measures tie an employee’s performance to the workings of the organization. If performance indicators and milestones in a management-by-objectives system are linked to the performance of the individual, they will gauge his degree of success and will enhance his progress. An obvious and very important responsibility of a manager is to steer his people away from irrelevant and meaningless rewards, such as office size or decor, and toward relevant and significant ones. The most important form of such *task-relevant feedback* is the performance review every subordinate should receive from his supervisor. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0g64s19e1nmaxmy46xjjhx))
	- Is there a systematic way to lead people to self-actualization? For an answer, let’s ask another question. Why does a person who is not terribly interested in his work at the office stretch himself to the limit running a marathon? What makes him run? *He is trying to beat other people or the stopwatch.* This is a simple model of self-actualization, wherein people will exert themselves to previously undreamed heights, forcing themselves to run farther or faster, while their efforts fill barrels with sweat. They will do this not for money, but just to beat the distance, the clock, or other people ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0gbgvk4508tb85xdfrx6nr))
	- Imagine how productive our country would become if managers could endow all work with the characteristics of competitive sports.
	  
	  To try to do this, we must first overcome cultural prejudice. Our society respects someone’s throwing himself into sports, but anybody who works very long hours is regarded as sick, a *workaholic.* So the prejudices of the majority say that sports are good and fun, but work is drudgery, a necessary evil, and in no way a source of pleasure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0gbsmbm85zh3xexws80zb1))
	- Conversely, of course, when the competition is removed, motivation associated with it vanishes. Consider the example of a newspaper columnist reflecting on his past. This journalist “thrived on beating the competition in the column, and his pleasure in his work began to wane after [his paper and the competitive paper] merged. ‘I’ll never forget that day of the merger,’ the columnist said. ‘I walked out to get the train, and I just thought: There isn’t anyone else to beat.’ ” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0h2vchgmk3hkkmpjv6s6sg))
	- Comparing our work to sports may also teach us how to cope with failure. As noted, one of the big impediments to a fully committed, highly motivated state of mind is preoccupation with failure. Yet we know that in any competitive sport, at least 50 percent of all matches are lost. All participants know that from the outset, and yet rarely do they give up at any stage of a contest. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0h3n1qvrgnfekf3rsbb7qt))
	- The role of the manager here is also clear: it is that of the *coach.* First, an ideal coach takes no personal credit for the success of his team, and because of that his players trust him. Second, he is tough on his team. By being critical, he tries to get the best performance his team members can provide. Third, a good coach was likely a good player himself at one time. And having played the game well, he also understands it well.
	  
	  Turning the workplace into a playing field can turn our subordinates into “athletes” dedicated to performing at the limit of their capabilities—the key to making our team consistent winners. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0h3hb7b1mb31mq1mcpgy6d))
	- Task-Relevant Maturity
	  
	  I’ll say again that a manager’s most important responsibility is to elicit top performance from his subordinates. Assuming we understand what motivates an employee, the question becomes: Is there a single best management style, one approach that will work better than all others? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0h41n1wv4pjr6bdw3d361d))
	- none of the early intuitive presumptions could be borne out: the hard findings simply would not show that one style of leadership was better than another. It was hard to escape the conclusion that no optimal management style existed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0mtwqphf8xhg91d6nmfx6n))
	- My own observations bear this out. At Intel we frequently rotate middle managers from one group to another in order to broaden their experience. These groups tend to be similar in background and in the type of work that they do, although their output tends to vary greatly. Some managers and their groups demonstrate themselves to be higher producers; others do not. The result of moving the managers about is often surprising. Neither the managers nor the groups maintain the characteristic of being either high-producing or low-producing as the managers are switched around. The inevitable conclusion is that high output is associated with particular *combinations* of certain managers and certain groups of workers. This also suggests that a given managerial approach is not equally effective under all conditions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0mw5xz4tvbyk7j5q9djkz2))
	- Some researchers in this field argue that there is a fundamental variable that tells you what the best management style is in a particular situation. That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience. Moreover, all this is very specific to the task at hand, and it is entirely possible for a person or a group of people to have a TRM that is high in one job but low in another ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0my0cwqzrv6f0ttyc2q6fv))
	- Similarly, a person’s TRM can be very high given a certain level of complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity, but if the pace of the job accelerates or if the job itself abruptly changes, the TRM of that individual will drop. It’s a bit like a person with many years’ experience driving on small country roads being suddenly asked to drive on a crowded metropolitan freeway. His TRM driving his own car will drop precipitously ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0myp1b9xnxxywfqe3977kg))
	- The conclusion is that varying management styles are needed as task-relevant maturity varies. Specifically, when the TRM is low, the most effective approach is one that offers very precise and detailed instructions, wherein the supervisor tells the subordinate what needs to be done, when, and how: in other words, a highly structured approach. As the TRM of the subordinate grows, the most effective style moves from the structured to one more given to communication, emotional support, and encouragement, in which the manager pays more attention to the subordinate as an individual than to the task at hand. As the TRM becomes even greater, the effective management style changes again. Here the manager’s involvement should be kept to a minimum, and should primarily consist of making sure that the objectives toward which the subordinate is working are mutually agreed upon. But regardless of what the TRM may be, the manager should always monitor a subordinate’s work closely enough to avoid surprises. The presence or absence of monitoring, as we’ve said before, is the difference between a supervisor’s *delegating* a task and *abdicating* it. The characteristics of the effective management style for the supervisor given the varying degrees of TRM are summarized in the table below. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0mzy0fsvjwqqqxy259t12b))
	- A word of caution is in order: do not make a value judgment and consider a structured management style less worthy than a communication-oriented one. What is “nice” or “not nice” should have no place in how you think or what you do. Remember, we are after what is most *effective.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0n0fdj9dfdeg0cyeqckv6t))

	- As supervisors, we should try to raise the task-relevant maturity of our subordinates as rapidly as possible for obvious pragmatic reasons. The appropriate management style for an employee with high TRM takes less time than detailed, structured, supervision requires. Moreover, once operational values are learned and TRM is high enough, the supervisor can delegate tasks to the subordinate, thus increasing his *managerial leverage.* Finally, at the highest levels of TRM, the subordinate’s training is presumably complete, and motivation is likely to come from within, from self-actualization, which is the most powerful source of energy and effort a manager can harness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0n6n2x05076ww1y73fbg40))

	- A manager once told me that his supervisor definitely practiced an effective communicating style with him because they skied and drank together. He was wrong. There is a huge distinction between a social relationship and a communicating *management* style, which is a caring involvement in the *work* of the subordinate. Close relationships off the job may help to create an equivalent relationship on the job, but they should not be confused. Two people I knew had a supervisor-subordinate relationship. They spent one week each year by themselves, fishing in a remote area. When fishing, they never talked about work—it being tacitly understood that work was off conversational limits. Oddly enough, their work relationship remained distant, their personal friendship having no effect on it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyadz776fmgy2ay5z713pzaw))
	- Performance Appraisal: Manager as Judge and Jury ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyae606t6ghdtz6r9x5k4hmq))
	- it is *to improve the subordinate’s performance.* The review is usually dedicated to two things: first, the *skill level* of the subordinate, to determine what skills are missing and to find ways to remedy that lack; and second, to intensify the subordinate’s *motivation* in order to get him on a higher performance curve for the same skill level ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyae5r6r069zxvc59s44sqgt))
	- To make an assessment less difficult, a supervisor should clarify in his own mind in advance what it is that he expects from a subordinate and then attempt to judge whether he performed to expectations. The biggest problem with most reviews is that we don’t usually define what it is we want from our subordinates, and, as noted earlier, if we don’t know what we want, we are surely not going to get it.

	- Let’s think back to our concept of the managerial “black box.” Using it, we can characterize performance by *output measures* and *internal measures.* The first represent the output of the black box, and include such things as completing designs, meeting sales quotas, or increasing the yield in a production process—things we can and should plot on charts. The internal measures take into account activities that go on inside the black box: whatever is being done to create output for the period under review and also that which sets the stage for the output of future periods. Are we reaching our current production goals in such a way that two months from now we are likely to face a group of disgruntled production employees? Are we positioning and developing people in the organization in such a way that our business can handle its tasks in the future? Are we doing all of the things that add up to a well-run department?

	- A similar kind of trade-off also has to be considered here: weighing long-term-oriented against short-term-oriented performance ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyaetx0ah0gq1tms9r2x56v8))
	- One big pitfall to be avoided is the “potential trap.” At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential. By “potential” I mean form rather than substance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyaf318eb2x1wz294vrcz57c))
	- *the performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the one we would accord to his organization!* It is very important to assess actual performance, not appearances; real output, not good form. Had the manager been given a high rating, Intel would have signaled to all at the company that to do well, you must “act” like a good manager, talk like one, and emulate one—but you don’t need to perform like one ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyaf3b9qp9hwrvdb4g8pzxh7))
	- A decision to promote is often linked, as it should be, to the performance review. We must recognize that no action communicates a manager’s values to an organization more clearly and loudly than his choice of whom he promotes. By elevating someone, we are, in effect, creating role models for others in our organization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyaf42qx906y8tnqba8p85j5))

	- There are three L’s to keep in mind when delivering a review: Level, listen, and leave yourself out. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyafa9fgvkxvsperzana9vcc))
	- You must level with your subordinate—the credibility and integrity of the entire system depend on your being totally frank. And don’t be surprised to find that praising someone in a straightforward fashion can be just as hard as criticizing him without embarrassment.

	- Every good classroom teacher works in the same way. He knows when what he is saying is being understood by his students. If it isn’t, he takes heed and explains things again or explains things in a different way ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyaf9r5h2qg9safwptfytrzw))
	- The third L is “leave yourself out.” It is very important for you to understand that the performance review is about and for your subordinate. So your own insecurities, anxieties, guilt, or whatever should be kept out of it. At issue are the subordinate’s problems, not the supervisor’s, and it is the subordinate’s day in court. Anyone called upon to assess the performance of another person is likely to have strong emotions before and during the review, just as actors have stage fright. You should work to control these emotions so that they don’t affect your task, though they will well up no matter how many reviews you’ve given. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyafbzvjhmk8zbxrgq6vw54f))
	- The key is to recognize that your subordinate, like most people, has only a *finite capacity* to deal with facts, issues, and suggestions. You may possess seven truths about his performance, but if his capacity is only four, at best you’ll waste your breath on the other three.

	- Now let me say a final thing: if you do at least 100 points worth of what you find here, you’ll be a distinctly better manager for it.
	  
	  *Production*
	  
	  Points
	  
	  Identify the operations in your work most like process, assembly, and test production.
	  
	  10
	  
	  For a project you are working on, identify the limiting step and map out the flow of work around it.
	  
	  10
	  
	  Define the proper places for the equivalents of receiving inspection, in-process inspection, and final inspection in your work. Decide whether these inspections should be monitoring steps or gate-like. Identify the conditions under which you can relax things and move to a variable inspection scheme.
	  
	  10
	  
	  Identify half a dozen new indicators for your group’s output. They should measure both the quantity and quality of the output.
	  
	  10
	  
	  Install these new indicators as a routine in your work area, and establish their regular review in your staff meetings.
	  
	  20
	  
	  What is the most important strategy (plan of action) you are pursing now? Describe the environmental demand that prompted it and your current status or momentum. Is your strategy likely to result in a satisfactory state of affairs for you or your organization if successfully implemented?
	  
	  20
	  
	  *Leverage*
	  
	  Conduct work simplification on your most tedious, time-consuming task. Eliminate at least 30 percent of the total number of steps involved.
	  
	  10
	  
	  Define your output: What are the output elements of the organization you manage and the organizations you can influence? List them in order of importance.
	  
	  10
	  
	  Analyze your information- and knowledge-gathering system. Is it properly balanced among “headlines,” “newspaper articles,” and “weekly news magazines”? Is redundancy built in?
	  
	  10
	  
	  Take a “tour.” Afterward, list the transactions you got involved in during its course.
	  
	  10
	  
	  Create a once-a-month “excuse” for a tour.
	  
	  10
	  
	  Describe how you will monitor the next project you delegate to a subordinate. What will you look for? How? How frequently?
	  
	  10
	  
	  Generate an inventory of projects on which you can work at discretionary times.
	  
	  10
	  
	  Hold a scheduled one-on-one with each of your subordinates. (Explain to them in advance what a one-on-one is about. Have them prepare for it.)
	  
	  20
	  
	  Look at your calendar for the last week. Classify your activities as low-/medium-/high-leverage. Generate a plan of action to do more of the high-leverage category. (What activities will you reduce?)
	  
	  10
	  
	  Forecast the demand on your time for the next week. What portion of your time is likely to be spent in meetings? Which of these are process-oriented meetings? Mission-oriented meetings? If the latter are over 25 percent of your total time, what should you do to reduce them?
	  
	  10
	  
	  Define the three most important objectives for your organization for the next three months. Support them with key results.
	  
	  20
	  
	  Have your subordinates do the same for themselves, after a thorough discussion of the set generated above.
	  
	  20
	  
	  Generate an inventory of pending decisions you are responsible for. Take three and structure the decision-making process for them, using the six-question approach.
	  
	  10
	  
	  Evaluate your own motivational state in terms of the Maslow hierarchy. Do the same for each of your subordinates.
	  
	  10
	  
	  Give your subordinates a racetrack: define a set of performance indicators for each.
	  
	  20
	  
	  List the various forms of task-relevant feedback your subordinates receive. How well can they gauge their progress through them?
	  
	  10
	  
	  Classify the task-relevant maturity of each of your subordinates as low, medium, or high. Evaluate the management style that would be most appropriate for each. Compare what your own style is with what it should be.
	  
	  10
	  
	  Evaluate the last performance review you received and also the last set of reviews you gave to your subordinates as a means of delivering task-relevant feedback. How well did the reviews do to improve performance? What was the nature of the communication process during the delivery of each?
	  
	  20
	  
	  Redo one of these reviews as it should have been done.
