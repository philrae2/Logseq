	- Consider this analogy that Zhang uses with her students at Stanford: “Say you’re trying to test whether people like pizza. If you serve them burnt pizza, you’re not getting feedback on whether they like pizza. You only know that they don’t like burnt pizza. Similarly, **when you’re only relying on the MVP, the fastest and cheapest functional prototype, you risk not actually testing your product, but rather a poor or flawed version of it**.

	- The concept of the minimum lovable product (MLP) sounds easy enough to get behind: You can yield far more valuable insights if your learnings are based on an early product that’s closer to something users could love. But while the MLP is a familiar philosophy often bandied about in manifestos on product design, in order to build truly lovable products, founders and product designers need to take the concept from the theoretical to the concrete. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvet60d1zj176qbf2q36qeyk))
	- At a high level, it’s hard to disagree with the concept that we should build products that people love. **But actually putting in the** ***intention*** **to build those products and** ***understand*** **those people is another matter entirely. It’s not about slapping a few shiny features into your beta and calling it a day**,” says Zhang. “As product builders, we need to drill a layer deeper. What does love even mean? How do you identify what would make your product lovable? How do you do it in a way that’s fast and efficient?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvet49g31hhff4vmbeafv8c6))
	- Shipping MLPs can bring powerful advantages for companies of all sizes. “If you’re at an early-stage startup, you need to be able to make the case for your users to stay while you [build-measure-learn](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) on the way to strong product/market fit,” she says. “For larger companies, creating MLPs shows that you care about users enough to continue to invest in offerings and new product lines that remind them why they fell for your products in the first place." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvet6d01pksd949j4mag9prs))
	- Building a minimum lovable product should start with a strong foundation of understanding. “If you don’t have a firm grasp on how to put an MLP into practice, you can waste a lot of time building a product that you think is lovable, but ultimately isn’t,” says Zhang ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvet6qf5qsn3xtravhj5m9pr))
	- Whether you’re a scrappy startup or at an established org, the first step for putting the MLP approach into practice is the same: "**Start with a high-value problem for your users, then get deeply curious about your users' needs and motivations**," says Zhang. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvet8g1pzjfdqppffznj2tsp))
	- Zhang highlights the four principles that she uses to guide founders and product managers toward the problem:
	  
	  1. Start with the user’s why, not the business why.
	  
	  2. Separate the problem space from the solution space.
	  
	  3. Listen to your users — but don’t take their word as gospel.
	  
	  4. Enter the solution space and choose your game. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvet8vt82t8c66nwj48va6aq))
	- 1. Start with the user’s why, not the business why.
	  
	  "**If there's one pitfall that companies fall into, it's that they focus on the 'why for the business' instead of 'the why for the users**,'" says Zhang. “Companies will naturally start with a why for the business, just because of how they operate. But as a product leader, if you don’t pair it with a ‘why’ for the user, you won’t be able to set up an effective problem statement for your team.”
	  
	  If product managers aim their efforts toward creating a product that solves a “why” for the business, rather than a “why” for the customer, they'll miss lovability by a long shot ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvet9j5mwjr9227165j0vr4d))
	- 2. Separate the problem space from the solution space ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvetxcestw56s76v9svk8jv2))
	- **Being able to detach yourself from what you** ***think*** **your users need and what they're actually experiencing is often the hardest lesson for PMs to learn — but it's the cornerstone for building lovable products,"** says Zhang. "This is most challenging at early-stage startups, where the founder is very passionate about an idea. But if you don't loosen your grip on a proposed solution, you won't be able to take in valuable feedback about the problem.”
	  
	  Never start with solutions. Just because you prefer the hammer or the screwdriver doesn't mean it's the tool you need to fix what's broken.

	- Listen to your users — but don’t take their word as gospel.
	  
	  “In order to develop a nuanced understanding of their high-value problems and pain points, **you need to strike the balance between listening to your users** ***carefully*****, but not** ***literally***,” says Zhang. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvety2rkc4900e54b70naz6n))
	- Here, she flags common mistakes that teams tend to make when it comes to conducting user interviews ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvetz36n9jbhmq44rjdvs95r))
	- **Asking customers what they want.** “When you ask your users what they want, there’s a tendency for them to talk about solutions they *think* you could build for them. Taking your customer too literally limits the scope of ideation.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvetydfa6s0je2hh86abmwk5))
	- **Positioning yourself as the voice of authority.** "Users often see you, the product manager, as the expert on the problem. You're not. *They* are. Make that dynamic clear at the outset, or you won't be able to unearth what your user truly cares about. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvetytd2g6vn1t0ps50hpdtq))
	- **It’s hard to build a product that several different user types all** ***love*****, especially at the get-go.** Focus on talking to enough people to learn about that one user type, and make sure you’re [asking open-ended questions to ensure you’re getting the right data](https://firstround.com/review/why-qualitative-market-research-belongs-in-your-startup-toolkit-and-how-to-wield-it-effectively/),” she says. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvetzpy98dterhqt66wnzyea))
	- To yield the most fruitful insights from your users, Zhang suggests asking the following question: **What do you find tedious, stressful, or painful?** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvev0a7apc95hvzmxjsgshg5))
	- **Diverge first to understand the problem space. Converge on the most important problem. Diverge again to come up with solutions. Converge on the solution that’s both usable** ***and*** **lovable** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvev23x1w7qdjcgb25vf1jv2))
	- Strike the balance of minimum and lovable
	  
	  The hardest part of creating the minimum lovable product is in the name itself: How do you create the most lovable product while expending the least effort?
	  
	  "This is why cultivating deep understanding *beforehand* is so important: It lends you insight into your users*'* core problem. **When you start building, zero in on just one or two features that truly bring value and delight to the user. That's what makes the MLP ‘minimum,’ yet still lovable.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvev36y2bkr0k8sxtas8v2zr))
	- You already know you could do a million things to improve your product. But focus on what’s most important to the user and what you can deliver in a timely way ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvev5bmzntb3a6mqkw0h2ab3))
