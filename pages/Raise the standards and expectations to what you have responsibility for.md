		 - ^^ Alexa execs, like leaders elsewhere in Amazon, became frequent recipients of the CEOâ€™s escalation emails, in which he forwarded a customer complaint accompanied by a single question mark and then expected a response within twenty-four hours.^^ 

- **Note:**
	 - If you are not in an environment with high level thinking, raise the standards yourself. Can you create excellence in the space that you have Can you raise standards on yourself, grow accountable and learn to reflect on your decisions and actions? How do we drive and push for excellence when the environment you are in accepts mediocrity?

	 - Expect the best from the people that you work with. Don't settle for mediocrity because their work will become a reflection of you.
