- #[[Reference Notes]]
	- Meyer's book makes a compelling, if simple argument: do hospitality well, get service really really right, and you'll have the secret to his success.
		- Meyer is a successful restauranteur—owner of Shake Shack and high-end Michelin star rated restaurants
	- Meyer regarded quality service as top priority, and he sought methods to spread a certain hospitality culture that was uniquely his.
	- _The results indicate that Union Square Cafe achieves its differentiation strategy of ‘enlightened hospitality’ through a synergistic set of human resource management practices involving three key practices: selection of employees based on emotional capabilities, respectful treatment of employees, and management through a simple set of rules that stimulate complex and intricate behaviours benefiting customers (emphasis mine)._
	- Meyer's results come from a three-legged self-reinforcing system that could produce a culture with "enlightened hospitality" as its output.
		- Reinforce group identity that kept employees feeling nurtured and engaged
		- Taught catch phrases and heuristics to guide service behavior
		- Design hiring process that weeded out customer-facing staff with the wrong set of emotional capabilities
		- _After her MBA, Salgado offered to work full time for Meyer at USH. Her solution to this problem was to formalise all of Danny’s practices as a series of management training classes. There, they simulated difficult situations that managers would have to deal with on a day-to-day basis: how to reprimand an employee who kept making mistakes, how to pre-emptively notice a customer growing frustrated, and how to mediate the inevitable disputes between front-of-house staff and back-of-house kitchen crew. Formalising Danny’s intuitive practices helped USH scale their operations to an empire of incredibly successful restaurants._
	- When you find behavior that deviates from a set of mainstream incentive-motivated behaviors, take a s closer look. You may find a set of interlocking systems that together creates a different set of incentives that gives extraordinary results.
