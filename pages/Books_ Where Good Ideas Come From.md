- #[[Literature Notes]]
	- [[An innovative environment promotes creating new connections between different domains of knowledge]]
	- [[To foster innovation, build a diverse network full of people outside your fields of interests and knowledge]]
- Takeaways and questions:
	- Drivers of knowledge and creativity #[[Learning Culture]]
		- [[[knowledge]] and [[creativity ]]grows the more diverse people bump into each other. This is exhibited by the level of invention and innovation that a large city like New York can foster compared to small towns with fewer people and little diversity
		- [[Connectivity and openness may drive [[innovation]] more than competition when viewed over a long span of time]]
			- Environments and cultures that are open-ended are more innovative than those that build walls around good ideas to protect them

		- To foster [[innovation]] we have to create an environment or culture that promotes [[Experimentation]] and accepts failure. We are more innovative if we expose ourselves to new and diverse ideas, even if they are incomplete. We won't be innovative if we stay in isolation.
		  id:: 17d1ee39-bd9a-4025-8dd6-28fda11bc169
			- We need to surround ourselves where people are talking, discussing, and sharing knowledge and information about their latest work to promote group problem-solving and create new combinations of ideas
			  id:: b0d6f415-5409-4e31-b132-4354412ce32b
			- When we work in silos we can get trapped in our own silos.
			- If we can't expose ourselves to people that are thoughtful and experimental. We can invest time in reading books. ((842860d7-f5d2-45dd-aac8-103033128b37))
	- Barriers to new ideas and combinations of ideas
		- Categorizing ideas can build barriers between disparate ideas and restrict them to their own conceptual islands
	- If we are not privileged to have a communal discussion, can a person or two replicate the same flow of information where multiple are discussing an idea?
	- Can decision-making benefit a connected network of discussions and sharing problems and proposed solutions?
- Text Extracts:
- Kleiber’s law proved that as life gets bigger, it slows down. But West’s model demonstrated one crucial way in which human-built cities broke from the patterns of biological life: as cities get bigger, they generate ideas at a faster clip. This is what we call “superlinear scaling”: if creativity scaled with size in a straight, linear fashion, you would of course find more patents and inventions in a larger city, but the number of patents and inventions per capita would be stable. West’s power laws suggested something far more provocative: that despite all the noise and crowding and distraction, the average resident of a metropolis with a population of five million people was almost three times more creative than the average resident of a town of a hundred thousand. “Great cities are not like towns only larger,” Jane Jacobs wrote nearly fifty years ago. West’s positive quarter-power law gave that insight a mathematical foundation. Something about the environment of a big city was making its residents significantly more innovative than residents of smaller towns. But what was it?

- Our thought shapes the spaces we inhabit, and our spaces return the favor. The argument of this book is that a series of shared properties and patterns recur again and again in unusually fertile environments. I have distilled them down into seven patterns, each one occupying a separate chapter. The more we embrace these patterns—in our private work habits and hobbies, in our office environments, in the design of new software tools—the better we will be at tapping our extraordinary capacity for innovative thinking.
- As you descend toward the center of the glass, the biological scales contract: from the global, deep time of evolution to the microscopic exchanges of neurons or DNA. At the center of the glass, the perspective shifts from nature to culture, and the scales widen: from individual thoughts and private workspaces to immense cities and global information networks. When we look at the history of innovation from the vantage point of the long zoom, what we find is that unusually generative environments display similar patterns of creativity at multiple scales simultaneously. You can’t explain the bio-diversity of the coral reef by simply studying the genetics of the coral itself. The reef generates and sustains so many different forms of life because of patterns that recur on the scales of cells, organisms, and the wider ecosystem itself. The sources of innovation in the city and the Web are equally [[fractal]]. In this sense, seeing the problem of innovation from the long-zoom perspective does not just give us new metaphors. It gives us new facts.

	- The pattern of “competition” is an excellent case in point. Every economics textbook will tell you that competition between rival firms leads to innovation in their products and services. But when you look at innovation from the long-zoom perspective, competition turns out to be less central to the history of good ideas than we generally think.
	- Analyzing [[innovation]] on the scale of individuals and organizations—as the standard textbooks do—distorts our view. It creates a picture of innovation that overstates the role of proprietary research and “survival of the fittest” [[competition]]. The long-zoom approach lets us see that openness and connectivity may, in the end, be more valuable to innovation than purely competitive mechanisms.

		- **Those patterns (openness and connectivity) of innovation deserve recognition—in part because it’s intrinsically important to understand why good ideas emerge historically, and in part because by embracing these patterns we can build environments that do a better job of nurturing good ideas, whether those environments are schools, governments, software platforms, poetry seminars, or social movements. **We can think more creatively if we open our minds to the many connected environments that make creativity possible.
		- We are often better served by connecting ideas than we are by protecting them. When one looks at [[innovation]] in nature and in culture, environments that build walls around good ideas tend to be less innovative in the long run that more open-ended environments.

			- Good ideas may not want to be free, but they do want to connect, fuse, recombine. They want to reinvent themselves by crossing conceptual borders.
- Chapter 1 - The adjacent Possible
- Good [[idea]]s are [[constrained]] by the parts and skills that surround them, they are works of bricolage; they're built out of that detritus.
	- We take ideas we've inherited or that we've stumbled across, and we jigger them together into some new shape.  Ideas are more often than not sudden transformative leaps and bounds, but small steps built on existing ideas. 
	  id:: f80af23c-f31f-4545-bc4a-edd24c1f77c3
	- Usually, ideas that are transformative, that skipped iterative processes, are too ahead of their time that will end up failing to implementation due to lacking technology for creation.
		- The trick is to figure out ways to explore the edges of possibility that surround you. This can be as simple as changing the physical environment you work in, or cultivating a specific kind of social network, or maintaining certain habits in the way you seek out and store information. #innovation
			- ^^[[innovative]] [[environment]]s are better at helping their inhabitants explore the adjacent possible, because they expose a wide and diverse sample of spare sparts--mechanical or conceptual--and they encourage novel ways of recombining those parts.^^
			  id:: b35c27b3-1e46-4207-b8a4-dfa23d9d65fe
				- Environments that block or limit those new combinations—by punishing [[experimentation]], by obscuring certain branches of possibility, by making the current state so satisfying that no one bothers to explore the edges—will, on average, generate and circulate fewer innovations than environments that encourage [[exploration]].
				  id:: 59acaad9-ab70-45c1-ab82-5c7197ed00f8
				- The trick to good [[idea]]s is not to sit around in glorious isolation and try to think in big thoughts. The trick is to get more parts on the table.

- Chapter 2  - Liquid Networks
	- To make your mind more innovative, you have to place it inside environments that share that same network signature: networks of ideas or people that mimic the neural networks of a mind exploring the boundaries of the adjacent possible. Certain environments enhance the brain's natural capacity to make new links of association. 
	  id:: 92d3fa29-2a4b-4ead-a54a-7ddd8e7c2238
		- Examples: Cities and other densely populated environments; the internet?
		- It's not to say that networks are smart, but rather people connected in a network get smarter.
		- ^^Most important [[idea]]s emerged during regular lab meetings, where a dozen or so researchers would gather and informally present and discuss their their latest work. [[Innovation]] isn't in isolation but through [[communication]] and discussion.^^
			- The group environment helped re-contextualize problems, as questions from colleagues forced researchers to think about their experiments on a different scale or level. 
			  id:: 70a5b415-5f53-4da5-a6c3-b2dc05af4147
			- Group interactions challenged researchers' assumptions about their more surprising findings, making them less likely to dismiss them as experimental error. 
			  id:: e01cddd6-efb7-454b-9507-3c1a99c0327b
			- In group problem-solving sessions, Dunbar writes, "the results of one person's reasoning became the input to another person's reasoning...resulting in significant changes in all aspects of the way the research was conducted."
				- Meetings and discussions create an environment where new combinations can occur, where information can spill over from one project to another.
					- When you work alone in an office, peering into a microscope, your ideas can get trapped in place, stuck in your own initial biases.

- Chapter 3 - The Slow Hunch
	- [[Network]]s allow incomplete [[idea]]s to [[connect]] with each other to form a complete whole, that may fully form to a great idea.
		- Most [[hunch]]es that turn into important [[innovation]]s unfold over much longer time frames.
		- Keeping a slow [[hunch]] alive poses challenges on multiple scales. Most slow hunches never last long enough in our minds to turn into something useful and we get distracted by something else. ^^The antidote is to [[write]] everything down.^^ #[[Note taking]]
		- ^^You need a system for capturing hunches, but not necessarily categorizing them, because categories can build [[barriers]] between disparate ideas, restrict them to their own conceptual islands.^^ This is one way in which the human history of innovation deviates from natural history. New ideas do not thrive on archipelagos.
- Chapter 4 - Serendipity
- [[dreaming]] may form valuable connections in your mind that can lead to [[insight]]s and [[discovery]]
- the quickest path to [[innovation]] is making new [[connection]]s
- go for a walk to allow your brain to make serendipitous connections
  id:: 9d76ac2a-dbd7-4d55-aa73-226b6b47f88c
- ^^Reading is an unsurpassed vehicle for the transmission of interesting new ideas and perspectives. ^^
  id:: 842860d7-f5d2-45dd-aac8-103033128b37
	- Unfortunately, a greater investment of time reading is necessary to make efficient connections, only an hour or two here and there in the fringes of your schedule reading is limited by the reach of your memory
		- **There is no easy fix for this. You must invest in the necessary hours to make connections between different books in an optimal amount of time.**
		- Don't limit your [[curiosity]] to only one field.
- the secret to organizational inspiration is to build information networks that allow hunches/ideas/thoughts/solutions to persist and disperse and recombine
  id:: 0712f01e-d087-43c6-842a-8bd746ae6bb1
- ((d4e9ead3-9529-433a-af3d-a6f68f4f5cfa))
- [[mistake]]s can lead to a solution for a completely different problem. Don't be   afraid of making mistakes
  id:: d4fa04eb-600b-43a7-885d-399debe3c017
	- [[error]] often creates a path that leads you out of your comfortable [[assumption]]s. When we're wrong we have challenge our assumptions, adopt new [[strategies]]
	  id:: 0b0c7ede-f1e7-4620-acab-d3dc7df54cee
	- introducing noise (inaccurate [[information]]) in our environment can make us smarter because we're forced to rethink our biases, to contemplate an alternate model
	  id:: 65bffba2-b700-49a6-971c-50f1ed15bf6d
	- [[innovative]] environments thrive on useful mistakes, and suffer when demands of quality control overwhelm them like when big organizations follow  perfectionist regimes like Six Sigma, and Total Quality Management. But [[mistake]]s are inevitable step on the path to true innovation
	  id:: 7177744b-979f-439d-9324-0dbd0ced13d9
- Exaptation
	- ^^look for [[solution]]s to your problems by exposing yourself to other fields of sciences, arts, and philosophy. Immerse yourself in other view points to see what their problems and solutions are.^^
	  id:: fb752a24-4a35-4ccc-b9bf-67895477270a
	- Cities are environments ripe for exaptation due to the sheer size and population density that allows for cultivation and growth of ideas. Cities also house more diverse cultures, subcultures, interests, ideas, and thoughts. A world where a diverse mix of distinct professions and passions overlap is a world where exaptations thrive.
	- ^^Build a diverse network full of contacts that go beyond your field of industry.^^
	  id:: 4f8ccfbe-b85e-445d-9871-93ebbdc4d2e4
		- How can you replicate this environment in our lives of diversity if we don't have the opportunity for a wide social network?
		  id:: 8bf65768-47fb-4dc7-ba3b-0f1a3f3e4336
			- We can pursue varied interests and hobbies.
			  id:: dbd9a799-724d-4a0b-81c5-cca87d0521e2
			- Take on different projects from different fields
			  id:: 071a4c28-cdf3-4543-a5e8-5e504e78c603
- Platforms
	- Platforms foster new ideas through providing divergent bodies of thinking an environment to take root and grow freely or at low cost (e.g., coral reefs, cities, beavers)
	- ^^When you don't have to ask for [[permission]], [[innovation]] thrives^^
	- [[Capitalism]] is not the driver of [[innovation]]s rather through non-market connected environments where information is shared freely without restrictions like patents and intellectual property protections
