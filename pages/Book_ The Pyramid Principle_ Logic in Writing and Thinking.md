	- The key to clear writing is to slot your ideas into a pyramidal form and test them against the rules before you begin to write. If any of the rules are broken, it is an indication that there is a flaw in our thinking or the ideas have not been fully developed or they are not related in a way that will make their message instantly clear to the reader.
- Notes:
	- The key to clear writing is to structure your [[thinking]] into a pyramid and check it against the rules before you begin to write
	- ^^The [[pyramid principle]] is applicable to any document in which your purpose is to present your thinking clearly^^
	- Logic in Writing
		- [[Unclear [[writing]] ]]comes from style or order and structure of the sentences.
			- ^^The easiest [[order of knowledge]] for a reader is to receive the more abstract ideas before minor, supporting ones. ^^
			- The ideal [[order of ideas]] is a pyramid of group of ideas held together by single unifying thought.
			  id:: e88274df-b3a0-4f42-81dd-885e03fd7eac
				- **The ideas will relate vertically - in any point at any level will always summarize the ideas grouped below it**
				  id:: ddce47dc-3493-4930-81d9-0b886f44b1e3
				- horizontally - the ideas present a logical argument
				  id:: 27439767-a0e6-4a2a-b790-589e709b02be
				- The [[pyramid structure]] follows the question/answer. 
				  id:: 4278da68-0063-4cc2-9058-a76e2605c8e6
					- **The first level is the statement of major ideas that promotes the reader to form a question**
					  id:: 4b9307b4-81e0-4bd7-aa2e-7f4186124692
					- **The lower levels will answer the reader's question**
					  id:: ab4190bf-24c4-4ec6-b09d-81d7887d4796
		- The mind automatically imposes order on every information around it
		  id:: bdc8e574-a41e-42dc-9a67-0e20f45d4fc8
		- The mind is limited to the amount of information it can comprehend
			- ^^**If the brain encounters information rising above five, it will start to group those items together into some logical order/categories so they can be retained**^^
			  id:: 7836085f-bf90-4fca-883b-6edc2122e961
		- Controlling the sequence and order of how we present our ideas is the single important factor to clear writing. 
		  id:: ec285fc4-d892-4677-b64d-f0e96d11afa6
		- **If your writing doesn't tell your readers how the ideas you present should be group, they will create relationships on their own to group them**
		  id:: 7e00aecf-f1d5-4254-a238-771064f6feff
			- The reader will always create and look for structure connecting the ideas you provide.
			  id:: ba879581-ed49-4e54-89e2-cd9db88dd9bf
				- To make sure the reader makes the correct connection you have to tell in advance what to look for. __State the logic__ of the ordering of ideas.
				  id:: fe1cb669-2098-4de6-8539-2dcdae7ca255
		- ^^The clearest written documents will be those that consistently present their information from the top down, in a pyramidal structure, even though the original thinking will have been done from the bottom up.^^
		  id:: dfbc08ff-505b-4fb0-a1a8-26c4b9b187e8
		- **Every document, presentation, or meeting you create will always be structured to support only one single thought**
			- __We must recognize that a reader,  no matter how intelligent they are has a limited amount of mental energy available in the act of reading. We have to economize through presenting ideas with the least amount of mental to comprehend and to sequence them optimally. __
			- The single thought should be the major point you want to make and all the ideas grouped underneath - will explain or defend that point in greater detail.
	- ^^The purpose of presenting information is to share information that your audience doesn't know.^^
		- **The audience must also find the information needful and useful**
		- __Your presentation should address a question that already exists in the minds of your audience__
		- ^^The only justification to present information to your audience, together with others, is to help explain or defend a higher point. This higher point can only be legitimately derived from a grouping of ideas only if the ideas in the grouping are properly related, either inductively (similar subjects or predicates) or deductively (the second point comments on the first)^^
	- Chapter 2
		- **Introductory Flow**
			- The Introductory flow is a narrative that provides the situation to the reader and sets up the expected background information they should know. It also serves as a reminder to the reader the question they are interested in and to what we will provide an answer to.
			- Use the storytelling device and ordering of information __Situation, Complication, Question, and Answer__ as a way to place your reader on the same page as you. Since history is a narrative, it should follow a narrative sequencing.
			- To illustrate, here is an introduction of the kind normally seen in business:
				- The purpose of this memorandum is to pull together some ideas for further reflection 
				  and discussion in such questions as: 
				  1. Composition of the Board and its optimum size 
				  2. A conception of the broad roles of the Board and the Executive Committee, the 
				  specific responsibilities of each, and the relationship of one to the other 
				  3. Making the outside Board member an effective participant 
				  4. Some principles dealing with the selection of Board members and their tenure 
				  5. Alternate ways for the company to get from where it is to where it wants to be in 
				  Board and Executive Committee operations.
				- Note how much more easily you comprehend the memorandum's purpose and 
				  message when it is forced to fit the narrative mold:
					- The new organization installed in October places full authority and 
					  responsibility for running the day-to-day activities of the two divisions 
					  squarely on the shoulders of the managers of those divisions. This move frees 
					  the Board to deal entirely with the broad matters of policy and planning that 
					  are its exclusive responsibility.
					- However; the Board has for so long oriented itself to dealing ·with short-term 
					  operating problems that it is not presently in a position to focus its attention effectively on long-range strategy development. Consequently, it must consider the changes needed to permit itself to do so. Specifically, we believe  it should:
						- Relinquish responsibility for day-to-day operating matters to the 
						  Executive Committee
						- Broaden its composition to include outside members
						- Establish policies and procedures to formalize internal operations.

			  id:: f8447b87-5290-496b-9490-d780204533b1
			- **One.** Vertical Relationship:__ Ideas at any level must always summarize the ideas grouped below it__
			  id:: 4e03c79c-9c65-4bf1-bdbf-2f93da0337c2
				- **The vertical relationship helps to capture the reader's attention by setting up a question/answer dialogue**
				  id:: 84029dfb-ac54-4569-a973-322cea3427f3
					- Presenting a statement to a reader that they don't know will invite them to raise a logical question in their mind--for example "Why?" or "How"
					  id:: 0d89737c-0e9b-4f7b-b2dd-18a04f376f90
					- To keep the reader's [[attention]], don't present a [[question]] until you are ready to answer them or answer a question you haven't raised.
					  id:: 76e28256-8e12-461d-a25c-b800f2ffacdf
					- The [[pyramid structure]] forces the writer to only reveal information as the reader needs it. 
					  id:: 78eae63f-4c86-4f21-893c-63da5263aea3
			- **Two.** Horizontal Relationship: __Ideas in each grouping must always be the same kind of idea__
				- The information below the main point or question must answer logically
					- [[inductive]] grouping
						- If you answer using [[inductive]] grouping the ideas must be logically alike and can be designated by a [[plural noun]] (reasons for, reasons against, steps, problems. etc)
						  id:: 07e6f3fe-d8f0-43d7-806e-dc3bb5bad79a
							- For example all items must have the same category for example: steps in an action, reasons for doing something, types of fruit
						- The set of ideas are related simply by description by related reasons
						  id:: 182ef0b3-e3e2-4dba-81b2-112a6e6d2ff8
							- ((35b72c26-8c66-49c4-b59d-fb75caabbbe4))
							- example:
							  id:: 761aeb87-d4a5-4486-830e-7f02d6191643
								- French tanks are at the Polish border
								  id:: e207d75a-d3f8-47c5-8460-1cd131bbe425
								- German tanks are at the Polish border
								  id:: 9fd58104-5bb5-4828-97ec-e7cb96081d21
								- Russian tanks are at the Polish border
								  id:: 5d662cf2-fb32-451a-a424-c15ed91de420
								- The inference for this example is that they are warlike movements against Poland and therefore Poland is about to be invaded
								  id:: 3c3db07e-8181-4f1c-bf59-b57b5a1e65e3
					- [[deductive]] grouping presents an argument in successive steps #blck:red
					  id:: 5b04e4d2-71b5-41d9-9b85-073ccffca036
						- If you answer using [[deductive]] reasoning, then you must have an argument which the second point comments on the subject or predicate of the first, and the third point draws a "therefore" from the previous two. 
						  id:: 9855df07-d3df-428c-b97f-1759b448d9b1

			- **Three.** Ideas in each grouping must always be logically ordered
	- 3. Building a Pyramid Structure
		- The [[Top-Down]] Approach of structuring information
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FW0Tp-6Abk2.png?alt=media&token=8de47951-431f-47ff-ab4e-8b9d0b51057b)
			- 1. State the subject of the information you want to present
			- 2. Decide on the question that your reader may be interested in knowing. What question are you answering from your reader's mind?
			- 3. Write the answer
			- 4. Identify the situation
				- Prove that you have the clearest statement of the Question and the Answer that you can formulate. Take the subject, move up to the Situation, and make the first statement about it you can make.
			- 5. Develop the Complication
				- What happened in the situation to trigger the question.
			- 6. Recheck the Question and Answer
				- The Statement of the complication should restate the Question you have already written down.
			- The purpose of the [[Top-Down]] approach is to make sure we understand our own question that we're trying to answer.
		- [[Bottom-Up]] Approach: Useful when our thinking isn't fully fleshed out or we don't have all the pieces to start organizing [[Top-Down]]. Perhaps we don't know the subject or the question we want to answer. Sometimes we don't know what background information our reader already possesses.
			- List all the points you think you want to make
			- Work out the relationships between them
			- Draw conclusions
		- **When using "headings" in your writing, make sure they reflect ideas rather than categories.** #[[Lessons Learned]]
			- Avoid headings like "assumptions" or "conclusions"
		- **Caveat for beginners:**#blck:red
			- Use the [[Top-Down]] approach first.
			- Use the situation as the starting point for thinking through the introductory flow, even though we can reorder the different elements like Complication, Question, and Answer. The order of these elements depends on the tone we want to create and the type of document we are creating.
			- Think through your introduction first so we have a strong foundation for our supporting ideas to stand non.
			- Always put historical chronology in the introduction.
				- The body can only contain ideas and simple historical ideas are not derived from logical thought. We can talk about events only if we are spelling a cause-effect relationship since those are derived through analytical thinking.
			- Limit the introduction to what the reader will agree is true.
			- Be sure to support all Key line points. An idea has to be supported until you have answered all the questions likely to be raised by it.
		- Use the Situation as the starting point for thinking through the [[introduction]]
			- Think through the introductory statement
			- Place historical chronology in the introduction
			- ^^Limit your introduction to information the reader will agree is true^^
				- ^^You start by making an agreeable and non-controversial statement about the subject ^^
					- The statement should be self-sufficient
						- Not requiring any previous statement to make the precise meaning clear
		- [[Complication]]
			- Problems may often be the complication but it necessarily doesn't have to be
			- Complication is the story you are telling that provides tension to trigger the question
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FTrLDEgn14o.png?alt=media&token=3ce1844d-2ea0-458d-bd21-dbd2e485a994)
		- ^^The order of the Situation, Complication, Question and Answer can be reordered to evoke emotions.^^
			- Standard - Situation, complication-solution
				- In recent years, the Firm has billed dozens of clients large amounts of money for diversification work. However, as yet no one in the London Office can claim the magnum of champagne available to the first consultant who can demonstrate an acquisition or merger by a client that would not have happened without our efforts. Since our diversification work has increased by 40 percent in the past 5 years, the time is ripe for a Firm Development Project to determine how we can ensure that diversification studies do bring significant benefits to the clients we serve. This memorandum outlines the major issues and hypotheses that should be resolved and tested
				  during the project.
			- DIRECT: solution-situation-complication
				- Our first priority for a Firm Development Project should be one directed toward improving our ability to help clients diversify. In the London Office alone, our work in helping clients find acquisition and merger candidates has increased by 40 percent over the past 5 years. Yet we cannot point to a single acquisition or merger that would not have happened without our efforts.
			- CONCERNED: complication-situation-solution
				- To my knowledge, no one in the London Office has yet conducted a single diversification study for a client that has yielded demonstrable results beyond what he could have done for himself. This situation is startling, since our practice in this area over the past 5 years has grown by 40 percent. We cannot in conscience go on charging clients for work that does not yield significant benefits and maintain our high reputation. I suggest, therefore, that we conduct a Firm Development Project to
				  determine how we can make diversification studies an area of our practice that is proven to bring significant benefit to clients.
			- AGGRESSIVE: question-situation-complication
				- How can we make sure that diversification studies remain a significant area of our work? These studies now constitute 40 percent of our practice, but there are few situations in which we can point
				  to having done more for the client than he could have done himself. We run the very real risk of losing momentum in this area unless we take steps to begin adding value. To this end, I suggest we immediately set up a Firm Development Project to determine how we can upgrade our skills in this area of our practice and make it one that consistently brings significant benefit to clients.
		- [[Key-Line]]
			- **The key-line points answer the question raised by the statement of the main point**
			- The key-line indicates the plan of the document
			- Key-line points should be expressed as ideas
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2F6EP05BVBnZ.png?alt=media&token=c84643b8-80f7-440f-82da-99e5563aead3)
			- For long articles, the key-line points can be used as headers
			- For short articles, the key-line points can be introductory topic sentences
			- Use inductive reasoning over deductive reasoning on the Key Line level.
			- Key-line points should be introduced
				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FyiS8p-K2xD.png?alt=media&token=252e3fdb-534a-466f-af5d-f8efebed7c3c)
					- The introduction has the form:
						- S = The belief is that using X toll will give you Y
						- C = Are using X, but others are getting Y
						- Q = Why are others getting Y?
						- A = A + B + X
					- BENCHMARKING (key-line) **Do NOT Do this.**
					  Leaders use benchmarking to judge the comparative efficiency and
					  effectiveness of their processes for delivering products or services.
						- To do so, they:
						- Measure efficiency of key processes
						- Compare performance against competitors
						- !Identify underlying reasons for differences.
					- Use a heading the reflects clearly the essence of the point and lead to the point by reviewing for the reader what they already know about the subject and how a question would have arisen to which this point is the answer.
					- BENCHMARKING PROCESS EFFICIENCY (**use this**)
						- S: Suppose you have put in TQM and cut loan application processing time from 2 days to 2 hours.
						- C: Are likely to assume such a big reduction is enough for competitive advantage
						- Q: Is it enough?
						- A: You can't tell until you compare yourself with the competition.
					- For subsequent key-lines:
						- The initial key-line introduction reminds the reader what they know about the subject and why the subject is is relevant to the overall point
						- The subsequent key-line introductions show how the about to be discussed subject is relevant to the one previously discussed
				- [[Writing Good Introductions]]
					- [Introductions]([[introduction]]) are meant to remind rather than inform.
						- There should be no new information that has to be proved for the reader to accept the statement of your points
					- Introductions should always contain the three elements of the story: situation, complication, and question
					- The length of the introduction depends on the needs of the reader and the demands of the subject
					- [[Common patterns for business documents]]
						- [[Giving Direction]] (What should we do? or How should we doit?)
							- For documents that are giving directions the introduction the question will be planted in the reader's mind rather than being directly stated
							- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2F1bZBSUBe4b.png?alt=media&token=aabad6ed-47a6-4f04-939a-484d251f363a)
						- [[Seeking Approval]]
							- Similar to [[Giving Direction]] the question is implied rather than stated
							- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FHw74QfmrUl.png?alt=media&token=d3e15349-b6ac-4632-aade-e2d58c79ba32)
							- In supporting a request for approval, there tend to be three, sometimes four,  standard reasons used to  defend the expenditure:
							- You should approve this request because:
								- Resolution of the problem cannot wait
								- This action will solve the problem (or this is the best way to solve the problem, if there are alternatives available)
								- The cost will be more than offset by the projected savings (or some other form of financial justification)
								- There are other goodies we can get.
							- Explaning [[How to]]
								- Someone has a problem and you are telling them how to use solve it
								- Two types:
									- You are telling the reader how to do something they have not done before
									- You are telling someone how to do something correctly as they are currently doing something improperly
										- Be sure that you know the current process and your proposed process intimately
	- 4. Fine Points of introductions
		- The introduction is in narrative (story) format because no one is really interested in what you have to say. The introduction is a story that tells a reader what they already know (Situation, Complication, and Question). The story format helps capture the attention of your reader more readily.
			- A good story contains a beginning, middle, and end—it establishes the Situation, Complication, and offers a resolution.
			- A good story is something that a reader already knows. (Is this true? What about something that the audience might disagree with but want to know?)
			- **Introduction components**
				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2F7JwPaaOqmR.png?alt=media&token=de416ef0-4ab0-4dd5-bc7b-d306c58d95b4)
				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FVkcTSY6vwj.png?alt=media&token=3984f953-99a8-4b43-9e95-fc88f96d5fa9)
		- Introductions are meant to to remind rather than inform. We shouldn't include information in the introduction that we have to prove or persuade the reader to believe (our persuasion comes after the introduction)
			- __The length of the introduction__
				- The introduction should be long enough so the reader and you are on the same page of understanding of the situation. An alignment of the situation is crucial when you will walk your reader through your reasoning as you offer a resolution through your thinking.
			- __Situation__
				- The situation should begin on something the reader agrees with because we are telling them something they already agree with.
			- __Complication__
				- The complication of the introduction (story) describes the change or alteration from the stable situation. It is not necessarily a problem, but often is.
				- Examples of complications:
					- Something went wrong.
					- Something could go wrong.
					- Something could change.
					- Something changed.
					- Here's what you might expect to find in it.
					- Here's someone with a different point of view.
					- In this situation we have these alternatives.
			- __the key lines__
				- The key line indicates the plan of the document, provides an answer to the new Question raised by the main point. The key line is still part of the introductory paragraph(s)
				- By setting our points, we allow the reader to quickly understand our entire thinking
				- As a rule of thumb, we never want to create headings like "Background" or "Introduction" because the major point it expresses will not be on the same level of abstraction as the other points that follows.
					- Never write about categories, only about ideas.
		- __Types of Documents__
			- __Directives__
				- A document where we tell someone else to do something. We will be planting the question in the readers' minds (implied), rather than reminding them of it.
			- __How to documents__
				- The main concept is to lay out the present process as they do it now and then lay out the process as you think it should be done.
		- __Transitions__
			- Use transition sentences either at the beginning of a new section or at the end of one. We need to give pause and allow the reader reflect on where they've been and where they will be
			- Use referencing backward as transitions. It simply means picking up a word or phrase or the main idea of the preceding portion of the pyramid you are linking and using it in your opening sentence
		- __Summary__
			- Summarize presented information for chapters or sections that are extremely long or complicated.
			- We write summaries to restate, as adroitly as possible, the principal matter and tone of the preceding text.
			- The job of the summary is to make the reader's thinking easier because we know more about the subject than they do and we also know how to think about the subject.
		- __Conclusions__
			- We don't need to write concluding paragraphs if we write a proper introduction and the structure of the body follows the pyramid rules.
			- Conclusions are difficult to write well and are best avoided
	- Chapter 5 Deduction and Induction: The difference
		- ^^Clear [[writing]] results from a clear exposition of the exact relationships between a group of ideas on the same subject. Properly organized, these ideas will always form a pyramid, various levels of abstraction established and related under a single thought.^^
		- **Ideas in a pyramid relate in three ways - up, down, and sideways. An idea above a grouping summarizes the ideas below, while the ideas in turn explain or defend the point above. At the same time, the ideas in the grouping march sideways in a logical order. What constitutes logical order differs depending on whether the pyramided group was formed deductively or inductively. **
			- The two forms of reasoning ([[inductive]] and [[deductive]]) are the only patterns available for establishing logical relationships between ideas.
				- [[deduction]] presents a line of reasoning that leads to a "therefore" conclusion, and the point above is a summary of that line of reasoning, resting heavily on the final point.
				- [[induction]] defines a group of facts or ideas to be the same kind of thing, and then makes a statement (or inference) about that sameness.
				- the deductive points derive from each other; the inductive points do not.
				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FDXtP8LUmws.png?alt=media&token=0f09409d-c567-4000-a5a4-e41736adcdc2)
				- [[deductive reasoning]] appears to be the pattern the mind generally prefers to use in most of its thinking, possibly because it is easier to construct than [[inductive]] reasoning
					- It is usually the pattern one follows in [[problem solving]], and therefore the one people attempt to follow in [[communicating]] their thinking. But while it is a useful way to [[think]], it is a ponderous way to [[write]].  #presenting #presentation
						- Is deductive reasoning useable as a presentation method

					- It is usually the pattern one follows in [[problem solving]], and therefore the one people attempt to follow in [[communicating]] their thinking. But while it is a useful way to [[think]], it is a ponderous way to [[write]].
					- deductive reasoning needs to do three things:
						- Make a statement about a situation that exists in the world
						- Make another statement about a related situation that exists in the world at the same time. The second statement relates to the first if it comments on either its subject or its predicate.
						- State the implication of these two situations existing in the world at the same time.

						- __Deductive reasoning, on the Key Line level, should be avoided and instead present your message inductively because it is easier on the reader. __
						- ^^The issue here is whether it is better to tell the reader why they should change and then how to go about it, or that they should change and why each change makes sense. As a rule of thumb, it is always better to present the action before the argument, since that is what the reader cares about, unless you face one of those rare cases in which it is the argument they really care about.^^

						- Inductive Reasoning
							- [[inductive]] reasoning is much more difficult to do well than deductive reasoning since it is a more creative activity. In inductive reasoning, the mind notices that several different things (ideas, events, facts) are similar in some way, brings them together in a group, and comments on the significance of their similarity.
							- In writing to recommend an action we will never give findings that do not lead to conclusions nor give conclusions that are not derived from findings.
								- We also won't give conclusions that we won't follow up with a recommended action to take.
								- The conclusions generally state the problem the recommendation solves.
								- Deductive reasoning can be reversed to inductive as with the following example:
									- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FBXXTM24MZT.png?alt=media&token=9f9bb8f6-5558-42f8-bda7-b2ea91afcf1c)
									- Deductively we start with the findings then to conclusions and finally end with our recommendations. But inductively we can start with the recommendations and then list our findings.
									- Again it is usually better to present the action before the argument (American perspective), since that is what the reader cares about.
									- __The exception to give the reasoning/findings first before the recommendation are:__
										- If the audience disagrees strongly to our recommendation, so you have to prepare them for it
										- If the audience is incapable of understanding the recommendation without explanation and reasoning that underlies our conclusion and recommendation
										- The recommendation for inductive structure is also useful for complex issues, but when the deductive argument is simple, then use deductive logic. Deductive arguments are easy to absorb if they reach directly, but when it takes pages and pages to reach the conclusion/recommendations from the findings, inductive reasoning is preferred.
							- **Two skills needed to think creatively in the inductive form** (refer to chapter 6)
								- defining the ideas in the grouping
								- identifying the misfits among them
								- Check your reasoning by questioning from the bottom up to get rid of misfits in your grouping
									- The groupings are identifiable by nouns: schemes, reasons, actions. The bottom layer (grouping) should make sense to support the above layer

							- Deductive and inductive reasoning usually leads to therefore and the audience naturally wants to predict ahead of you what your point is. If their conclusions are not in line with yours then they will get confused and annoyed. Therefore it is better to state the recommendation and conclusions up front, then proceed with the supporting arguments.
	- Part 2 - Logic in Thinking
		- Looking critically at groupings of ideas requires hard work-it is the essence of the thinking process-which is no doubt why it is so often ignored. But ignoring it means that you never quite say what you mean to your reader and-worse-you never quite grasp the essence of your own thinking. That in turn not only wastes time and resources but, sadly, could mean you don't achieve all of the major insights and breakthroughs in thinking that are possible.
		- Chapter 6 - Imposing Logical Order
			- The second rule of the Minto Pyramid Principle is that ideas in any grouping must be in a logical order. The logical order rule helps to make sure that the ideas you have brought together truly belong together, and that you have not left any out.
				- The order you choose should reflect the analytical activity that your mind performed to create the grouping.

					- 1. It can determine the causes of an effect: Whenever you make statements in writing that tell the reader to do something, you do so because you believe the action will have a particular effect. You have determined in advance the effect you to achieve, and the identified the action necessary to achieve it.
					- 2. It can divide a whole into parts.
					- 3. It can classify like things together.
				- ^^Limit your groupings to no more than **four or five** and then have subheadings if necessary to expand further^^
		- Time Order
			- Time-ordered grouping is to reflect the steps a person must take to achieve a particular effect, in the order in which they must take. Problems can arise when people do not distinguish between cause and effect when they  list their ideas.
			- Distinguishing Cause from Effect
				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FOFjvuwsCBD.png?alt=media&token=b75b551a-4dc1-4cae-a8e5-5637c7baf1d5)
				- The trick to avoiding cause-effect mistakes is to visualize yourself actually taking the action you are writing about in each case, and state what you will have in your hand at the end of the action.
				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FolYJCv4Udt.png?alt=media&token=5a8f574f-11f7-4a6d-8b49-a51ce4c631c9)

					- You can then judge whether you must take one particular action before you can take the next, or whether you must take it in order to achieve the next.

			- Revealing the Underlying Process
				- Recognizing that you are drawing conclusions based on an underlying process is helpful in clarifying your real message. **People frequently make lists of conclusions that allude to, rather than state the points they are actually trying to make.**

		- Structural Order
			- It is the order that reflects what you see once you have visualized something--either by diagram or map. It can be real or conceptual, an object or a process.  It must be properly divided to show it's parts.
			- Creating a Structure
				- When you divide a whole into its parts make sure that the pieces are:
					- mutually exclusive of each other
						- exclusivity means that whatever goes into a division, it is not replicated in any other division
					- collectively exhaustive in terms of the whole
						- exhaustive means that whatever goes into all the division means that it encompasses everything needed and contained by the system
				- We can create structures and divisions by activities, location, or sets of activities
					- If we divide by activities, they reflect a process and thus go in time order
					- if we divide by location, they go in structural order, reflecting the realities of geography
					- if we divide by activities relating to a single product/market, ideas are in degree order by whatever measure we decide (sales, volume, investment size)
					- example: if we are ordering departments of a city by importance if we were starting a city from scratch:
						- housing
						- transportation
						- education
						- recreation
						- personal health
						- environmental health
			- Describing a Structure
				- Once a structure is set up, one way to describe it is to follow it from the top down and from left to right, describing each part in the order in which it appears.
			- Using the concept to clarify thinking
				- You can use the concept of structural order to help you sort out faulty logic in a grouping.
		- Degree of Order
			- Order of importance, this is imposed on a grouping when it brings together a set of things we have classified as alike because they possess a characteristic in common.
			- ^^It is better to present the strongest point up front instead of relying on emotional build up from least to most important order.^^
			- Identifying Improper Class Groupings
				- Identifying the proper source of class grouping can help clarify your real message.
				- When listing items, the trick is to go through and sort into rough categories, as a prelude to looking more critically.
				- Order depends on the process, and the process is dependent on the question being answered.
		- With any grouping of inductive ideas that you are reviewing for sense, always begin by running your eye quickly down the list.
			- Do you find an order (time, structure, degree)?
			- If not, can you identify the source of the grouping and thus impose one(process, structure, class)?
			- If you have a long list, can you see similarities that allow you to make subgroupings, and impose an order on those?
			- Once you know a grouping of ideas is valid and complete, you are in a position to draw a logical inference from it.
	- Chapter 7 - Summarizing Grouped Ideas
		- Avoid intellectually blank assertions
			- Intellectually blank assertions are deadly for the reader because they do not anchor their mind, they are not stimulating to read, and they present the very real danger the they will not grasp what you are trying to say.
				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FlBJK_WFTbg.png?alt=media&token=e03a28eb-d4f8-418e-9a86-aa17047f6078)

			- Intellectually blank assertions also cover up incomplete thinking, and thus they cheat you out of a wonderful opportunity to move your thinking forward in an orderly and creative way and further stimulates further thinking.
			- You must have a true summary statement derived from a proper grouping before the process can yield new insights.
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FMt61dDPJ4C.png?alt=media&token=abb97c03-d43d-4954-af93-19564989742b)

			- You should check the origin of the grouping to make sure it is MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exclusive) (i.e., that its order reflects a valid process, structure, or classification)
				- Regardless of the origin of the idea, its expression will be either as an action statement, telling the reader to do something, or as a statement, telling the reader about something:
					- Summarize the action idea by stating the effect of carrying out the actions
					- Summarize the situation ideas by stating what their being similar implies
					- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FlqRKIVu6AH.png?alt=media&token=b1319f34-d346-460c-a0d7-eea0c646a0e6)
		- State the effect of actions
