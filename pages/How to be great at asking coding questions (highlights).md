	- People that ask good questions are more effective because they get better answers more quickly and more often. They’re also taken more seriously and get more respect, which matters if you care about your career. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytc69rc76myfkpt7e27a8n9))
	- Good questions save time. Bad questions waste time. Bad questions create unnecessary back-and-forth conversations, which create frustration and conflict. People that ask bad questions get frustrated because they can’t get help, and people that are trying to help get frustrated because answering bad questions is so damn frustrating.
	  
	  Bad question askers usually don’t get far in their careers. That’s because working with them is pure frustration. If you were a manager and had to fire someone, you’d immediately think of people that ask bad questions. The only thing that saves most bad question askers is that everyone around them is bad too, and so in relative terms, they look alright.

	- 1. Understand the code to the best of your ability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytc7k5cw46dmeetagwa41r9))
		- **Note**: Understand the problem space deeply and learn about topics that you may not know but have access to further your knowledge.
	- Google unfamiliar concepts. You want to avoid asking a question that you can figure out on your own with a quick Google search ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytc9y11pc35nxn7kp4prcjg))
	- Clearly describe the problem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytca5awsqyrjca1mc245j3b))
	- Check yourself for typos.
	  
	  •   Nobody wants to look for your typos. If you can’t find your own typos, you need to learn how (just keep reading). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytccqwm6eyn7619vj6d401w))
	- 7. Explain what you did to troubleshoot the problem.
	  
	  •   Come up with a list of hypotheses about what the problem might be and then test them methodically. For each hypothesis, explain what you did to test each hypothesis.
	  •   During this process you might figure out the problem yourself. This is very common. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytcdb569q19t2n9fen32zpw))
	- . Explain what you think the problem might be.
	  
	  •   Based on your tests in the previous step, provide your best guess on what you think the problem might be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytcdkhb81s9ra7eame7bfrt))
	- 9. Proofread your question.
	  
	  •   Read through your question and make sure you’ve provided everything that someone would need to answer it.
	  •   Edit for clarity. If you think something might be confusing, fix it. If there’s a typo, fix it. If you have typos in your question, people will assume that you have typos in your code. And like I said before, other people are not your personal typo hunters. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytcdvs9hjte7efx2gy4phqm))
