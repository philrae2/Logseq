	 - Do you seed the thing? Yes.

	 - Ineke's

- https://thegadgetflow.com/blog/crowdfunding-checklist/
	 - It would be advisable to create an official press release 24 hours before your campaign goes live. Send it to all the media outlets you have reached out to before. That way, you’ll be able to spread the word immediately after your campaign goes live.

	 - 7. Get to 30% of Your Goal As Fast As You Can
id:: 254d2bb7-3e49-4a47-91ca-b5e8aaa5dd54
		 - You have more chances to get featured on Indiegogo or Kickstarter if your campaign reaches 30% of its goal within 48 hours. You can also rely on family, friends, and acquaintances to help you reach that 30% even faster.

	 - 9. Prep a Stretch Goal Chart
id:: fcab0855-27ef-45fc-b8a0-78392072fbb3
		 - Once you start getting more attention for your campaign, start setting up a stretch goal chart. That way, you can grab your backer’s attention even more.

	 - 2. Keep Updating Your Backers of the Progress
id:: cd35f681-6247-4a61-b4c6-c6bb3a1c790f
		 - Update your backers about the progress once in every three weeks. Let them know that your project is under works and keep the excitement going. Sharing behind-the-scenes and production images will heighten excitement and your backers may even continue to share your project.

	 - 8. Thank Every Backer Individually
id:: 54d4ce53-72c4-4cac-9990-0fa1a5e902a3
		 - There should be a thank you video clip and newsletter for your subscribers and backers once the campaign is over. A little gesture of gratitude always works. It adds a personal touch to your overall campaign and makes you more visible in front of your backers.

- [[November 4th, 2020]] notes from [[Tim Ferriss @tferriss]] [[Kickstarter]] playbook https://tim.blog/2012/12/18/hacking-kickstarter-how-to-raise-100000-in-10-days-includes-successful-templates-e-mails-etc/
	 - Get stats on similar projects
id:: f7b7a30b-95d6-42c1-a818-c3b0026cc614
		 - My friend, [Clay Hebert](https://twitter.com/clayhebert), is a Kickstarter expert. One of the things he taught me is a simple trick using [Bit.ly](http://bit.ly/) tracking. Bit.ly is a link shortening service used by millions of people…and Kickstarter.^^ If you add a + to the end of any bit.ly URL, you can see stats about that link.^^ For example: here are stats for the shortlink Kickstarter generated for our campaign http://kck.st/VjAFva+.

		 - To discover the top referral sources, we gave our VA a list of Kickstarter projects similar to ours and asked her to list the referrers for each project. Almost without fail, the order of top referrers was:
id:: 5dbc104e-2c98-44d7-b00f-be6ce593d80e
			 - Facebook

			 - Direct traffic (primarily via email)

			 - Twitter

			 - Kickstarter

			 - Blogs

		 - ^^Based on this data, we decided to focus all of our attention on just two goals:^^
			 - Getting coverage on the right blogs

			 - Activating our networks to create buzz on Facebook, Twitter, and email

		 - We knew that if we did this, we would be listed on Kickstarter’s “popular projects” sections, which is how you get people who are browsing Kickstarter to check out and back your project.

	 - Media Outlet / Blog outreach
		 - Therefore, when making your media list, these are the four things to look for:
id:: 58f02423-8f3c-44fb-8c43-7424dc93c231
			 - **Relevance** – will their readers LOVE your project?

			 - **Readership** – how much traffic does their site get? __[TIM: For a quick idea, I use the [SEO for Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seo-for-chrome/oangcciaeihlfmhppegpdceadpfaoclj?hl=en-US)]__

			 - **Relationships** – do you know at least one person who can make a strong introduction?

			 - **Reach** – will the blog reach prospective backers by promoting your post via email newsletter, RSS feed, Facebook, Twitter, and other channels? __[TIM: This is the most neglected checkbox. Blogs that expect you to drive all traffic to their posts are a waste of time. Remember: big site-wide traffic does not mean each post gets much (or any) traffic.]__

		 - How to find them
id:: bc79d566-2d97-4096-b025-acf9c7e05ae3
			 - Find 10 Kickstarter projects similar to yours, and for each, do the following.
				 - Right-click and save-to-desktop 2-3 images.

				 - Drag and drop each image file from your desktop into the Google Images search bar.

				 - Review blogs listed on the results page to see which might be relevant to your project.

				 - Fill out the following fields in the attached “Media List” spreadsheet: Publication, URL, first and last name of the writer, and links to relevant posts by that writer.

		 - II. Research site traffic on [Compete.com](http://www.compete.com/)
id:: 687b16e1-cb5f-4ad5-b21b-8318116a93cb

		 - To estimate a blog’s reach, have your VA research how many followers it has on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and RSS. Once you make your short list of media targets (see below), you should also sign up for each blog’s email newsletter.
id:: 3ca4a0b6-578e-4bc2-87ca-2b0f2d261d23

		 - V. Review your media list and turn it into a dossier fit for a Seal Team 6 secret mission
id:: a7512fa7-910c-4c50-bdcd-978e8b357d7b
			 - Open your media list spreadsheet and look at the mutual friends you share with each blogger. Delete the people you do not know well enough to ask for an introduction. Email the people who remain and say, “Hey ____, I saw you’re friends with [name of blogger] on Facebook. Do you know him well enough to make an intro next month? I think our Kickstarter project could be a good fit for [name of blog]. Thanks!” Based on the answers you get, rate how strong your relationship is for each blog (1 = strong, 3 = weak). If your VA didn’t find any mutual connections, tweet or post on Facebook: “Please message me if you know anyone at [name of blog]. I have a great story I’d like to share with them. Thanks!” I did this twice and immediately got introductions.

			 - Spend some time on each blog and judge for yourself how relevant it is. Rate relevance in the spreadsheet (1 = extremely relevant, 3 = not relevant).

			 - For each blog, research the writers your VA found. Based on their past posts, are they really the best bloggers to cover you? Is there anyone at the blog who is a better fit?

			 - Now, sort your [spreadsheet](http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=181254) by relevance, relationships, and readership (in that order) to prioritize your outreach. Have your VA find email addresses for the top ten bloggers in your spreadsheet. At this point, you should only focus on ten bloggers.

			 - Using this [template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wh0vKsWEOstmfUFdsYyPPQ3bgRRu6fi770hnSDTNWnw/edit), have your VA make a one-page brief for each of the top 10 bloggers. Print these out and hang them on the wall like wanted posters or put them in a top secret dossier. Whether you fancy yourself a bounty hunter or the next James Bond, your mission is to find, befriend, and get covered by these bloggers so the dream you’re launching on Kickstarter can become a reality.

		 - Step 4: Turn bloggers into buddies
			 - The key is to genuinely form friendships with bloggers. They get pitched every day by strangers who don’t care about them and only want publicity. Do the exact opposite. Really care about them. Figure out ways to be helpful. Hang out. Even if they don’t end up covering you, at least you’ll have a new friend.

		 - Step 5: Get the story and make specific requests to maximize your reach

		 - Step 6: Segment and activate your network
			 - The way to activate your network of friends is to give them a sense of ownership. Let them know they are part of the team. That way, they are working with you, rather than doing you favors.

		 - Step 7: Use landing pages to spark sharing
