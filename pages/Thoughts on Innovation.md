- We can invite our customers to innovate and problem solve with us rather than us doing all the work of thinking through the problem
- Innovation lies in chaos. Don't be afraid to put yourself in situations that are uncomfortable.
	- If everything seems under control, you're not just going fast enough. The business should always be outrunning the processes, so chaos is right where you want to be. And in a chaotic environment the only way to get things done is through relationships, not hierarchy.
- Innovation can come from simplifying #Simplification
