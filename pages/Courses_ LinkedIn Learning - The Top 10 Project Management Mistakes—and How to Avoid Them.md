	- The 12 Step Process
		- Just for people who are doing a small project or just want to get on with doing project management, these are the key 12 parts of the APM process. So if you follow this project management process you should be fine, your project should come in on time, on budget, and correct to the specification.
		- ^^Define:^^ Step one of the process is to define what your project is, be really clear about what you're doing, and I think step one is the biggest cause of failure for projects. If you leave it a bit vague there is a risk that when you deliver it people are going to say, well that's not what I was imagining, or that's not what I wanted. So to all agree, all the stakeholders agree in writing, this is what we're going to have.
			- Cost, quality, and time, this is how much we're going to spend, this is what we're going to have, in scope and out of scope, and also, how long's it going to take. So step one, define the project, that's really important, don't overlook that.
		- ^^Plan:^^ Then you start on the planning, steps two to eight are all about having a really good plan.
			- The first part of planning, step two, is to get a list of all the tasks, and there is a slight question about how much granularity to have, how small do you go? Do you just say, I'm going to build a house so I've got to do the kitchen, I've got to do the bathroom, the foundations, the roof? Or do you divide the kitchen down into the cooker, and the heated floor, and the lights? Or do you go even more detailed, do you say I'm going to drill that hole, push the wire through? So there's a slight question about how detailed to go, but step two is to get a list of all the tasks.
		- ^^Estimate:^^ Then step three is to estimate those tasks, and there are two things to estimate, the time and the money. So how long do we think each task will take to do, and what will it cost to do?
			- And just to clarify what I mean by time, 'cause there are two types of time, we have to decide how many hours of work are involved, and we got to estimate that, but also the elapsed time, how many weeks till it's finished, and those are different things. Sometimes people talk about days, I'm suspicious about days 'cause if you say, well it's a three day job, do you mean it's three days of work or do you mean it's three days of elapsed time till it's finished? I like to use hours of work and then weeks of elapsed time. I was talking about estimating the time and the money, the time is the elapsed time, three weeks, the money is the hours of work, plus other costs. So step three is to do your estimating.
		- ^^Network Diagram:^^ Step four, and I'm going to show you this in a bit more detail later, step four is to work out the running order of the tasks, and this is usually called a network diagram. What order are we going to do the tasks in? Step four is really the heart of your planning process, that's when you really decide, are we going to risk buying a building when we haven't got a permit for that country, or are we going to get the furniture before the manager, does the manager need to have a say in the furniture?
			- So step four is where we think about the interconnections, the dependencies between the tasks, and we draw it all out in order, and it also tells us therefore how long the project's going to take 'cause we can add up the times, so that's step four. T
		- Then step five is to speed up that diagram if necessary, because if you add up all the tasks and it comes to too much then how do we speed it up? And we can do that by overlapping some of the tasks or throwing money at them, that kind of thing.
		- ^^Gannt Chart:^^ Then we get to step six, which is the Gantt chart, now again I'm going to talk about these more later, but the Gantt chart is basically a series of bars drawn out with the right length, so you have a time scale on your diagram and so, you show each task as a bar and then you can see the whole project drawn out as a series of bars, so that's the Gantt chart.
		- ^^Resources:^^ Step seven of the 12 step process is then to think about resources because if you've got several bars all happening at the same time you can look vertically and you can ask yourself, do we have enough resource to do everything that we want to do on this project? And we've either got to get more people, or perhaps we'll have to move some of those bars later and take longer, so step seven is to think about the resources for your project and perhaps also for all of your projects, because what if we've got enough for that project, but unfortunately at the same time as that we've got a couple of other projects happening. I have a thing called the Gantt of Gantts where you look at all your projects and you just check, can we do all the things we want to do in this time scale? So that's step seven, thinking about the resources you need for one project and for multiple projects.
		- ^^Risks:^^ Then the final step of the planning is step eight, which is risk. You look at your whole plan and you think, what might go wrong with this project? How likely is it to go wrong, how serious would it be if it did go wrong, and how can we make it less likely or less serious? So risk and mitigation of risk is step eight. That's steps two to eight of the 12 and that's the planning stage of project management.
			- We then start the project. Remember if you're doing agile, you plan and do, plan and do, plan and do, but what we're doing with the APM process is that we plan the whole thing, and then we do the whole thing. And you can see how there are benefits and risks of that, 'cause there is a risk that you'll spend ages planning and when you do the first bit you'll find there's something wrong with your plan, but if you do plan, do, plan, do, then you don't have an overall view of the project and you don't know how long it's going to take, so the APM have decided to do all the planning, make sure it's right and then you carry out your plan.
		- ^^Monitor your progress:^^ Step nine, as you carry out your plan you monitor your progress. And that's normally done by coloring in the Gantt chart, I'm going to show you this later, so you color in so that you can check that you're keeping up with your plan, and so that is step nine.
		- ^^Monitor your budget:^^ Step 10 is where you monitor the money, so you keep a track of how much you've spent, and again you have a look at whether what you have spent compares favorably with what you should've spent, and if you're over-spending you can work out what to do.
		- ^^Course Correct:^^ Step 11 is where we adjust our plan if necessary, so if we are running behind or we're over-spending at step 11 we think, right, what are we going to do about that? And of course things always change during projects, sometimes it's outside factors, sometimes it's the customer asking for something else, but for whatever reason things change during projects, and so step 11 is where we rejig the plan, and this is where agile people say, ah well you see, you know your process isn't very flexible, but actually it's really flexible because we know we're going to be changing the plan at step 11. We've got a whole step for that and we're absolutely fine with that, we know that no battle plan withstands contact with the enemy, but the good thing about having a plan is that if you have the change it you know the effect of the change. So if a customer says, oh, can I have an extra page on that website? You can say, yeah absolutely, no problem at all to do that but it will take a bit longer and it will cost a bit more, compared to the original plan, so that's step 11.
		- ^^Review:^^ And then finally step 12 is to review the project at the end. What have we learnt? Often forgotten, very important, because it's really the only time that you learn. You think you'll remember for next time, but will you? So step 12 is where you write down everything you've learned and you store all your reviews in a folder so that anybody different to you who might be doing a similar project to the one you did can look in the folder and learn the lessons. So even if you've learnt it the challenge is for the whole organization to learn those lessons, and you can do that if you keep a folder of reviews. That's the APM process and you can see it's four sections really, it's defining the project, it's planning the project, it's monitoring the project, and then it's reviewing it at the end. That's the ideal way that you would do your projects but the big question really is what tends to go wrong?
	- Having a Plan in Your Head
		- So the first mistake that people make with projects is having the plan in your head. And it's actually surprising how many people have their project plan in their head.
			- Now obviously, if you're going to build a nuclear power station or put a space rocket on Mars, you're not going to have that in your head. But for most projects, suppose we're just going to install a new machine in a factory or something like that, or we're going to set up a new sales office or something, it's very tempting to have it in your head. 'Cause you think, well, obviously I'll have to this first. I'll look for a site and, oh yeah, I need to probably get a manager. So you start in your head and then before long you start thinking, hmm, this is all getting a bit complicated now. But it's kind of too late then 'cause it's all in your head. So I think it's very easy to have the plan in your head. But if you stand back and think about that, it has to be a bad idea. First of all, you can't possibly hold a decent project plan in your head. If there's more than 10 tasks and they're interrelated, and you have to remember to do one of them in three week's time, you're never going to be able to do that. However clever you are, I just don't think you can hold a project plan in your head like that. So, that's the first problem. It's going to be stressful to keep it there and to remember it, especially if you've got a number of projects. How can you hold all those different project plans in your head? That's going to feel horrible. But suppose that you are clever enough to hold a number of project plans in your head. It's still a bad idea because you can't show it to your boss. So when your boss says, "Why is it going to take a year?" You want to be able to show them and say, "Well, because look, I have to do this, this, this." But you can't show it to your boss. Now you may say, well, my boss trusts me, my boss doesn't need to see my plan. But I think it's really a good arguing tool when you want to have more resources or more time or more money. It's great to be able to say to you boss, "Look, I think I need more of this "because look at this plan." But there's also the other direction. There's your team, and your team needs to see the plan. Now you may say, "No they don't. "I'll just tell them what to do." But it's much more motivational if you can say to the team, "Here's the plan of what we're going to do, "and there's your bit that you're doing "and you can see how important your bit is, "how it fits in with the overall plan. "And between us, we're all going to achieve "this fantastic thing." So it's much more motivational for the team if you can have a plan drawn out. So we've got boss and team. The third person involved in all of this is the customer. Now, it may be an internal project, in which case the customer is your boss. But if it's an external project, then you absolutely must have something to show the customer. And it's a great sales aid to say to the customer, "This is why it's going to take quite a long time "and this is why it's quite expensive, "because look how complicated this project is." And it also sends the message to the customer that you are a scientific organization and a scientific person, you know, you're professional, you're organized, you've got a proper plan. They're much more likely to trust you and be happy if you can show them a plan. So, you absolutely must have a plan for all those people. The boss, the team, and the customers. Finally, imagine if you had, say, a hundred tasks. You couldn't possibly keep that in your head. So what you would do is you would have probably 10 or 20 tasks drawn out as an overall plan that you can show to bosses and customers and then you would have sub-tasks. So behind each one of those, you might have another 10 or 20 sub-tasks. And then when you get to that particular part of your project, you can then open up the sub-tasks and really manage it tightly. But you can imagine you could never possibly do that in your head. So, mistake number one is trying to hold a project plan in your head. And that's a really bad idea.
		- What we need to do instead is to draw something out.
	- Making a Plan
		- I've just been describing how it's a really bad idea to hold a project plan in your head. We need to draw it out in some way. I want to show you what I would recommend as the best way to draw this out.
			- They'll recommend what's called a network diagram, and a Gantt chart. What I've realized is we need both.
				- Quite often in books, they just say, the network diagram's great for thinking about dependencies, and the Gantt chart is great for thinking about timescales. But they don't really make the point very clearly that you need both, and you absolutely do need both.
					- The first thing you do is you just get a list of all the tasks, and I mentioned that, and then you estimate the times of the tasks.
					- Then you put them on some sort of, some sort of plan, some sort of network diagram. What I've done is I've just prepared, pre-prepared on here a whole load of Post-it notes with tasks, and that's what you would do.

						  Network Diagram,  critical path diagram, or sometimes also called a PERT chart.
						- I then need to put the dependencies
						- Just to sum this up, I think you need both of these. You do need to go through the Post-its to get to the Gantt chart, because how could you jump straight to this? It needs to know the critical path first, and then the floaters all hang off that.
						- To ^^find the critical path^^, you have to do the Post-its, and you have to decide on the running order. The Post-its are great for that. You get the running order, get the critical path, and then it's dead easy to draw the Gantt chart based on that. So, you need both. Do not try to have all of this in your head. It's never going to work.
		- Don't rely on lists only. A list will lose visual information from the Gannt chart
	- Mistake: Not planning across projects
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FhaN6IAB4sC.png?alt=media&token=defdc91b-ca60-4775-af51-cf8150fa5ef6)
		- Create a gannt of gannts to clearly see your resources among other projects and to evaluate your progress.
	- When people are telling you stories to describe their progress, ask for a timeline or gannt chart to assess if they are doing the right amount of work at the right time to see if your ahead or behind schedule.
	- Thinking Underspend is OK
		- Underspending usually means you are late and behind schedule.
		- Overspending can hide that you maybe behind schedule. Check your Gannt chart regularly.
	- Rescheduling too late
		- Monitor the progress of your schedule throughout the progress. Prevent the last minute surprise. Get support earlier instead of delivering bad news too late.
	- Complete a retrospective review of the project.
		- Share pain points, shortfalls, and knowledge gap
		- Share what we did well
		- We can make the review a fun thing
