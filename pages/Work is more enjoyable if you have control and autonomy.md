- **Note:**
	 - When assessing if a job is worth staying in or considering leaving for another job, determine if you gain more control in the new role.

	 - If you are wanting to enjoy your job more, it isn't what you do, but rather if you have the autonomy to make impactful decisions.
		 - You may have autonomy in administrative work, but autonomy in that context is trivial and isn't impactful
