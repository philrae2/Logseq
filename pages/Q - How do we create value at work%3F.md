- Considerations:
	- Find value for the users by understanding their environment. Don't assume your solutions solve their pain point or satisfies their wants.
	- Ask if they took away your solution, who would cry wanting it back? Would they care if it away?

- Questions
	- How do we know we are creating value for our customers?
