- When asking or answering a question. Make sure to assess and analyze its complexity. We may be asking questions that we think are simple but actually complicated to answer. We may need to go to several people for more information to answer the question or worse not know that we need additional information to truly arrive at an informed decision or solution. In this case, we may be giving out incomplete answers or receiving ignorant responses from others.  One way to break down a question is to use [[Systems Thinking]] and look for the relationships before and after the question or problem. When looking at the preceding event or motivation before the question, we can ask what problem this question is trying to solve. What problem or issue is motivating this question? 

- When we look at what precedes the question, the motivation of asking it in the first place, we can check if we're asking the right question. When we see that our question requires multiple steps and difficult to arrive at an informed decision, we can step back at the motivating factor and ask ourselves is there a different question we can ask that would fulfill the same preceding motivator.

- After looking at the motivator, which is the hidden real question or problem to answer, look at the complexity of the answer. Keep in mind the real question may be buried under several motivators. To simplify the process pick the least complicated question attached to the least complicated answer that still arrives at your goal. 
	 - We or the person responding to our question may not know their goal, but we can tease that out by looking at the motivation. We can then make assume the solution to that original motivator is our goal. From the goal, we can then reverse engineer the process to look at the solution and find the correct question to ask. However, keep in mind that we are sure we picked the correct goal.
