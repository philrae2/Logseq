			 - 3:37 The happiness of an orchestra does not come only from the conductor's story and his joy from the music. The joy is about enabling other people's stories to be heard at the same time: the orchestra as a professional body, the audience as a community, the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and the audience.

			 - 4:30 The conductor [[Riccardo Muti]] as an example of a domineering style of leadership.

				 - 6:14 Clear instructions, clear sanctions

				 - 6:50 A domineering style of project management could work for the short term, but may produce resentment from the team.
					 - 7:10 "You are using us as instruments, not as partners."

			 - 7:30 The conductor [[Richard Strauss]] as an example of a by-the-book style of leadership.

				 - 8:48 "It is not about my story, it is not about your story. It is only about the execution of the written music. No interpretation."

			 - 9:08 The conductor [[Herbert von Karajan]] as an example of a leader that gives a lot of responsibility to the orchestra for the interpretation of the music.

				 - 10:46 "The worst damage I can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction, because that would prevent the ensembleâ€”the listening to each otherâ€”that's needed for an orchestra."

				 - 11:05 The mind game of letting your team guess what you want, rather than be clear about it.

			 - 11:57 The conductor [[Carlos Kleiber]] as an example of a leader that weaves together multiple layers of stories.
id:: fb71b859-b5db-41b2-9e42-69bbd4de8ce1
				 - 13:11 "I'm opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation. That is another story. But how does it really work together if he doesn't give them instructions? It's like being in a rollercoaster. You are not really given any instructions but the forces of the process itself keep you in place. That's what he does."
					 - 13:35 "The interesting thing is that the rollercoaster does not really exist. It is not a physical thing. It is in the players' heads. And that's what make them into partners."

				 - 14:10 What happens when there is a mistake?
					 - 15:03 When it is needed, the authority is there.
id:: 61fed35a-46ec-4ebe-9356-2cb585d7977d
						 - 15:06 But authority is not enough to make people your partners.
							 - 15:37 See? He is there 100% but not commanding, not telling what to do. Rather, enjoying what the soloist is doing.
								 - 16:10 Appreciation, not feedback.

				 - 16:17 It is about being in control, but in a special way.
					 - 16:30 Kleiber creates the process but also creates the conditions in the world in which these processes take place.

					 - 16:48 Kleiber is in control in a level different to that of the soloist. Control is no longer a zero-sum game.

					 - 17:06 You need process and content to create meaning.

			 - 17:18 The conductor [[Leonard Bernstein]] as an example of a leader who starts with meaning.
id:: f9ec0f7b-3371-450e-9eec-66cea83bfa8e
				 - 18:42 It is about you the player telling the story. Bernstein enables that.

			 - 19:23 "If you love something, give it away."
				 - That's why I'm sharing this video!
