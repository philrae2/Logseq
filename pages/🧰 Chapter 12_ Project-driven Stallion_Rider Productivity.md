- Project management tells us how to bring ideas to reality. All project management tools ultimately lead to the WBS: the work needed to bring an idea to reality. Through leadership, you orchestrate the work of your project team. Whether you work solo, contribute to executing the WBS or you are a full-time project manager, you need to get work done yourself. [[Work brings ideas to reality]].
	 - Task management or productivity is the craft of getting your work done.
		 - In the context of project management, productivity is the craft of getting the [work packages](((3030e9f6-de72-49b3-bc22-c03687be3949))) you own done.

- **An alternative to GTD**
	 - All the tools and frameworks in this rBook have gone through two filters: I got them from a community's best practices (mostly from the [PMBOK](((3bf5ada8-53c9-4af0-aa78-2f6d1f395507)))) and I've used them myself. This chapter is an exception. Today's prevailing task management methodology is Getting Things Done (GTD), as presented in the book of the same name by David Allen. Even Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain (BASB) is built on ideas from GTD. I didn't even get to the point of trying GTD out because the system just didn't make sense to me. I had to come up with something else.

- In this chapter, I share the productivity system that worked for me. I call it **Project-driven Stallion\Rider Productivity**. It has 5 steps:
	 - Choose your projects

	 - Manage your projects
id:: 67f4dece-58be-46bd-9ffd-a2000c571b45

	 - Create your menu
id:: 6b164245-ad4b-4de0-a2f6-903057b77559

	 - Choose the day
id:: 01f95d74-46a1-4933-88d9-40747cdd1556

	 - Choose the pomodoro
id:: a61de6b1-af7d-47e8-b778-1e8d084e9f29

- This 5-step process is underpinned by the following principles:
	 - Productivity is less about volume of work, and more about shot selection
id:: 5942a1e8-7be4-424f-b266-600887d6c4ba

	 - The job of the manager is to design the environment, not to tell the maker what to do
id:: 24fe8030-a280-4f50-9fff-51fe25dfa6b6

	 - The mind rests on the brain, the brain rests on the body
id:: e3ee262b-d862-4d77-9aa3-635665dca45d

- This productivity system was built through trial-and-error. Below, I try to rationalize why this system works for me, which may help you decide if it is right for you as well.

		 - > The key idea is that you have a choice of to-dos from each of your projects. Most times, it doesn't matter which to-do you work on today. If you choose ones which attract your Stallion, you'll run faster.

		 - What projects could bring you to your desired future?
			 - There are systematic ways of laying the foundations of choosing your future: [Future Authoring](https://www.selfauthoring.com/future-authoring), [Goal-Crafting Workshops](https://www.google.com/search?q=goal+crafting+intensive) or creating a GTD Purpose and Principles page.
				 - What these practices miss is the power of listening to inspiration. If we limit our projects to those that we could rationalize, we miss out on so many adventures and so much good fortune. [Liz Gilbert's mythology of ideas](((8500f260-ad63-4b26-bb57-cf27761b16b8))) is what helped me become a better listener to inspiration.

			 - Seeing our purpose and choosing our pathways towards our desired future is not a one-time event. We need to nourish our minds with meaning, the way we need to nourish our bodies with food.
				 - This is why I take every opportunity to tell [my origin story and what I'm working towards]([[ðŸ§­ Prologue | Why I Wrote This rBook: Project Management Freed Me From the Mental Prison of the Pandemic]]). [My Rider and my Stallion](((a551a675-7e4b-4c2e-9a16-8f3dfe447eb0))) are my main audience.
id:: a5d4c688-3cfa-49a6-8b74-e03eac64aab5

				 - A lot of us have a daily practice of meditation. Whatever your meditation style is, that time of reflection is also a good moment to reinforce the meaning of our projects, to be open to new ones, and to decide to close current ones.
					 - Aside from daily meditation, I also do a monthly recollection of a few hours and a yearly retreat of a few days. These allow me to go deeper into envisioning, circumspection and making choices.

		 - The act of choosing projects is expressed as a Roam template which lists down links to my project pages. (We will use this template for Step 3.)
			 - [[Tip for Roam beginners]] on creating Roam templates:
				 - Instead of creating templates in the roam/templates page, create them in some other page (eg, Today's Daily Note) and indent them under linked references that serve as tags or categories for the template. Once you have dozens of templates, it will be easier to find and update them under the linked references of roam/templates, by using those tags or categories as filters. Here's an example:
					 - [[project management]] [[purpose]]
id:: 24f8b536-9977-4e04-b011-4da872a9a640
						 - Project list / pathways to the future / work menu / choose your own adventure CYOA [[roam/templates]]
id:: 757215b7-a096-4cc8-a56d-12c4fba2f43a
							 - [[Work Menu]]
								 - [[Project 1]]

								 - [[Project 2]]

								 - [[Project 3]]

				 - I also find it useful to give the template a name that captures multiple possible names my future self could use for this list, so that when I need to summon it (;;), I have multiple pathways to recall it: ((757215b7-a096-4cc8-a56d-12c4fba2f43a))

				 - I arrange projects in the template in terms of priority.

			 - As needed (eg, when making a decision during a meditation, recollection or retreat), I add or delete a project in the template, or rearrange the order of the list.

		 - [[Maximize your learning]] 
			 - Create a template which lists down your projects as linked references.

			 - If you are a beginner in using roam/templates, change the linked reference tags / categories and the name of this template. Then replace the project list with an initial list of projects that could bring you to the future you envision.
				 - {{embed  ((24f8b536-9977-4e04-b011-4da872a9a640))}}

				 - Test out the template by typing two semi-colons (;;), typing keywords from your template name to find it in the selection, select it and press enter.
					 - 

	 - 2. ((67f4dece-58be-46bd-9ffd-a2000c571b45))
		 - For each project, decide whether you need to use project management tools. Then choose which among them are most appropriate for you projects. Like most things, choosing the appropriate tools will get easier the more projects you manage. Here's how I think about this:
			 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamfu%2F4g3gFefBcI.png?alt=media&token=b9eb675b-906f-492f-80e1-f41c31a9855d)
				 - If the project is large and important enough and [the work is expansive](((fc63ad03-a58f-4225-bb19-d588a1973460))), create a WBS, RBS and a Risk Register for it.

				 - If others are involved in the project or it takes a long time (ie, you'll need to coordinate with your future selves), create a project charter.

				 - Use the other tools as necessary.

	 - 3. ((6b164245-ad4b-4de0-a2f6-903057b77559))
		 - This is a list of tasks indented under their project pages. You can use your template of projects to create this. This is not a to-do list. This is more of choose-your-own-adventure paths for the upcoming work cycle (a few days to a few weeks). Here's an example.
			 - {{embed  ((7c438804-4bf6-448d-850d-69809fc8b0f8))}}

		 - For projects with a WBS, I option/alt-drag blocks from the WBS.

		 - For tasks that need to be done on specific days, I tag a date so that it will appear in my linked references on that day.

		 - There is no need to put tasks under all the projects. I delete the empty project linked references in this case. They are low priority for that work cycle.

		 - I add tasks as needed.

		 - I pin this menu in my sidebar until I replace it with the next one. I block reference the original task if I carry a task into the next work cycle. In the example below, task b under Project 2 is a block reference from the menu above. Always reference the original block (avoid block ref of a block ref of a block ref). This allows you to create a report of time spent per task if you use pomodoro (for an example, click the references of task e belowâ€”the number 5 to its right). 
			 - {{embed  ((bf53768c-47c3-411b-9492-6332fbc3ecce))}}

		 - I create a new menu when the current one becomes overwhelming.

		 - [[Note to advanced Roam users]]
			 - If you like using queries, you can create a list for each project using [[TODO]] the project name and dates or a tag that indicates the task should be in the current work cycle.
				 - {{[[query]]: {and: [[Project 2]] [[TODO]] {between: {[[May 1st, 2021]] [[May 30th, 2021]]}}}}}

	 - 4. ((01f95d74-46a1-4933-88d9-40747cdd1556))
		 - My Daily Notes Pages has two top level blocks:
			 - [[Interstitial Journal]]

			 - [[TODO Today]]

		 - At the beginning of the day, during my morning meditation, I block reference tasks under [[TODO Today]] (always using the original block) or I add new tasks.
			 - Examples of questions that help me fill this out:
				 - [[Top TODO for work]]

				 - [[Top TODO for friends and family]]

				 - [[Top TODO for habit building]]

			 - This list of questions are in a roam/template I use for my meditation. If you have a spiritual practice, you can also ask questions from that perspective. I share my practice [here](https://roambrain.com/using-roam-for-your-spiritual-growth-stack/).

	 - 5. ((a61de6b1-af7d-47e8-b778-1e8d084e9f29))
		 - A key principle in the [[Stallion\Rider]] model, is that [[we run fastest when our work is both meaningful to the Rider and exciting to the Stallion.]]. If we had chosen projects aligned to our purpose, any task in our menu should fulfill the first criterion. We just need to listen to our Stallion to fulfill the second.
			 - To me, this choice is expressed as a pomodoro block indented under [[Interstitial Journal]]. My format is <current time> <block reference to the original task> <pomodoro timer>. For example:
				 - {{embed  ((bfe76d34-7be5-470d-8a12-46095bf791f0))}}

				 - If you like to keep your Daily Notes Pages clean, you can indent the task and the pomodoro under the time so you can collapse them. The important thing is to place the pomodoro timer beside or as a parent of the task block, if you want to track the time you spend on tasks. For an example, go to this block and look at the linked references, to get an idea how long this chapter took to write:
					 - ((a996a948-0992-4957-91eb-b9d68062377b))
						 - Filter with [[POMO]] if there are a lot of non-pomodoro usages of the block.

			 - Here's how a day looks like for this graph, which I use for writing about project management and preparing for project management training. My main graph has more diverse types of tasks.
				 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamfu%2FP6CkPts4Q5.png?alt=media&token=fcfd820f-e7e9-4f2c-a38c-d9b699872a73)

		 - > Pomodoros are just guides. If I'm in the flow, I skip the breaks. If I'm stuck, the breaks give me a chance to reset.

- Principles underpinning Project-Driven Stallion\Rider Productivity
	 - ((5942a1e8-7be4-424f-b266-600887d6c4ba))
		 - A key principle in both GTD and BASB is the capture habit. The pathological execution of this principle is to capture and do as many tasks as possible. If we look at the bigger picture of our lives, we will see that we should throw out or neglect tasks, rather than capture more of them. Our ideas our limited only by our minds. Bringing them to reality is limited by the amount of time we have. We have much less time than ideas.
			 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamfu%2FvbS-Iy2D57.png?alt=media&token=62ffc5d8-e649-4d56-98df-61743e6ddbdf)

		 - In the sport of boxing, there is the concept of "shot selection." Winning is not primarily about the volume and the power of your punches. Before those come into play, you need to pick your punches and hit your opponent.
id:: 7bdcd1a5-1caa-4979-a966-de8ac0abc77b
			 - Bringing ideas to reality is also fundamentally about shot selection. We only have a few decades to live. In each day of those decades, we only have a few pomodoros. We cannot increase our time. However, we can take better shots.
				 - The project management tools presented in this rBook is ultimately about shot selection. Which work packages in your WBS are the [[80/20]] for the project? Which are the highest scoring risks in your Risk Register?
					 - At a higher level, [we need to choose projects that are aligned to our life's purpose.](((7c91f1d6-5ef4-47a9-9c7f-98b3916b08a4)))

	 - ((24fe8030-a280-4f50-9fff-51fe25dfa6b6))
		 - In most of human history, the master gives a list of tasks and the slave does them. As we have seen in the [previous chapter]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 11 | People Will Make or Break Your Project: Leading a Team]]), this is not ideal for leading free and educated people.
			 - We should also avoid being taskmasters of our future selves, creating a list of tasks that that we force ourselves to do at the appointed time. Instead, we can serve our future selves by designing the environment. When we are in manager mode, we make use of these project management tools to be reminded of the meaning of our work and give our maker-selves a hand-selected menu of options.
				 - The manager trusts the maker to select the best tasks at the moment of work. The maker trusts that the manager did the work of shot selection.

				 - Developing the mental muscle of discipline is good. Discipline becomes a problem if it is our only tool for getting things done.

		 - > We need to enable shot selection at the moment of work because [[we run fastest when our work is both meaningful to the Rider and exciting to the Stallion.]]

	 - ((e3ee262b-d862-4d77-9aa3-635665dca45d))
		 - There is a selection bias in documented productivity systems. Those who write books tend to be believers in solving problems with the mind. [I was also like this.](((3d14c596-961f-4291-b852-29380568a27a))) The question of how to be more productive tends to get answered with processes and techniques.
			 - The image of [[Stallion\Rider]] reminds us that the power of the Stallion depends on its health. In concrete terms, this means that we need to spend as much time taking care of our sleep, exercise and nutrition, as we spend on project and task management.
				 - The Rider also needs to be healthy: it needs purpose, friendship and virtue the way the Stallion needs rest, play and food.

	 - **"How do you sustain your enthusiasm for a project?"** A participant asked me this question in one project training I did.
id:: 323de8fa-4def-4647-addb-cb96eb20dd87
		 - I answered based on my experience of burn-out and overcoming it. In the past, my solution was to make my work more meaningful, mainly by writing about it ([here's an example](https://medium.com/startupph-chronicles/finding-meaning-in-my-work-as-an-entrepreneur-a421b1154f70)). I realize now that this solution is incomplete. My bias was to solve problems with reason, probably because of my upbringing. I did not yet see the power of emotion in motivation.
id:: 3d14c596-961f-4291-b852-29380568a27a
			 - I know now that to truly motivate ourselves (and other people), we must address two kinds of needs:
				 - The needs of reason: meaning and purpose.

				 - The needs of emotion: status, camaraderie, recognition, adventure, novelty, etc.

			 - This ties-in well with the System 1 / System 2 model of decision-making presented in Daniel Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow." #.book-recommendation
				 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamfu%2FgDdq6JoNIP.png?alt=media&token=6012b5d9-3942-4f63-922c-23274f8f9d3c)

			 - I considered different ways to visualize this, and ended up with the Stallion representing emotion and the Rider representing reason. It turns out the ancient Greeks used this imagery as well[*](https://twitter.com/meshachthomas/status/1379696116623568899). It is tried-and-tested.

	 - ((3d3b1078-02ff-4cd3-b92e-ce48a5e1e911))
		 - GTD clearly works for some people. Why does it work for them and not for me and presumably many others?
id:: 2a2ed567-8339-4b53-ad06-73efb2b594fe
			 - Is personality the answer? To explore this, I looked at the most popular ways of slicing the pie of personality: OCEAN, MBTI, Strengthsfinder, DISC, Kolbe A, and Enneagram.
				 - Some of these helped me understand my Stallion better. However, I found them too complex for day-to-day use of influencing motivation. The model I found useful for this purpose was Gretchen Rubin's Four Tendencies, as presented in her book of the same name. #.book-recommendation
					 - Rubin's model is a 2x2 answering these two questions:
						 - Do you embrace or rebel against **external** expectations?

						 - Do you embrace or rebel against **internal** expectations?

						 - {{[[table]]}}
							 - **The Four Tendencies**
								 - Embraces __external__ expectations
									 - Rebels against __external__ expectations

							 - Embraces __internal__ expectations
								 - The Upholder
									 - The Questioner

							 - Rebels against __internal__ expectations
								 - The Obliger
									 - The Rebel

					 - However, I see two problems with this model.
						 - First is the naming. Most of the people I've explained this to want to be Rebels, and no one wants to be an Obliger. People are smart enough to game the Four Tendencies test to get the category they want.

						 - Second is the model itself. It does not really understand the people it calls Rebels. This may be because the author is an Upholder (she says so in the book). No one rebels for the sake of rebelling. We rebel because we are protecting something we value: freedom.

						 - Third, why do we need to categorize ourselves and other people?

		 - Riffing on our [[Stallion\Rider]] model, we can improve on the Four Tendencies:
			 - ![Sport and Spectacle - Archaeology Magazine](https://www.archaeology.org/images/JA2015/Horses/Horses-Roman-Mosaic.jpg)

			 - The rider is a charioteer directing three stallions:
				 - The Promise-Keeper
					 - The Stallion of the Past.

					 - If the Promise-Keeper is your dominant Stallion, you get things done if you make promises. 

					 - Scheduling to-dos in advance works for you, so you are freed from having to choose what to do in the moment. GTD probably works for you.

					 - You often don't notice brewing rebellion from your Stallions.

				 - The Freedom-Fighter
					 - The Stallion of the Present.

					 - If the Freedom-Fighter dominates, you need to choose to-dos at the moment.

					 - Freedom is sacred to you. You rebel against anything that feels like an imposition from your past or future selves, or from other people.

					 - You'll do tasks as long as you know you are free not to do them.

				 - The Vision-Chaser
					 - The Stallion of the Future.

					 - If the Vision-Chaser dominates, you see the past and the present simply as pathways to the destination: the future.

					 - You are fueled by your vision of the future. You sacrifice today for tomorrow.

					 - To you, it is pointless to do tasks that don't bring you closer to your vision.

			 - I visualize these three as white, black and brown stallions.
				 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamfu%2FoGMo-TIl9i.png?alt=media&token=7b881b73-2ab2-4371-881b-7a6b9e1abd87)

		 - GTD is designed for the White Stallion
			 - Let's use the language of Three Stallions to answer our question: ((2a2ed567-8339-4b53-ad06-73efb2b594fe))
				 - GTD's emphasis on capturing and processing tasks is a relief to the White Stallion. It allows the remembering and the keeping of promises.
					 - Capturing and processing tasks feels like a form of slavery to the Black Stallion, and if they are not pathways to its envisioned future, they are a nuisance to the Brown Stallion.

				 - The lists created through GTD frees the White Stallion from having to choose what to do at the moment. These same lists feel constricting to the Black Stallion.
					 - This sounds analogous to the difference between extroverts and introverts. Social interaction energizes the extrovert and drains the introvert.
						 - Choosing what to do at work session is inefficient to the White Stallion. Why not just do what you already planned? Choosing energizes the Black Stallion. It is a celebration of freedom. 

		 - Day-to-day usage of the Three Stallions for motivation
			 - The Three Stallions is not another way to classify ourselves or other people. It is more of a checklist for motivation, because all of us have all three stallions:
				 - We want to be faithful to our commitments

				 - We want to be free

				 - We want to get to the future we envision

			 - When designing our productivity system, we want to address the three, particularly the Stallion that dominates in us.

			 - The same checklist can be useful for motivating our teammates.

		 - Designing a Productivity System for the Black Stallion and the Brown Stallion
			 - What would be our design requirements for a productivity system for people who are fueled by their vision of the future and by the need to choose at the moment?
				 - Each task must contribute to a project that brings you closer to your vision

				 - It must give you the freedom to choose a task at the moment of work

			 - Project-driven Stallion\Rider Productivity meets these design requirements.
