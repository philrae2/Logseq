- > We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.[*](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/06/26/shape/)

- On [[June 13th, 2020]], a muse visited me.[*](https://twitter.com/kcorazo/status/1271729632635768832) Her suggestion was simple: __Why don't you use Roam for project management?__
	 - I said Yes to that idea. Since then, Roam has become [my headquarters for the thinking part of bringing my ideas to reality](((13923716-985e-470e-b411-3949f6cc7c45))).

- At the beginning of this journey, I shared how [Roam has trained](((4dba9934-8f50-45d2-87e6-4c6177198ed9))) [my mind](((29230a60-d625-42a7-b6ad-580dbf324325))) [to become more networked](((121e30e3-faa6-4692-a860-c20708f68932))).
	 - Roam has also transformed how I see projects. The same way a book is composed of atomic blocks of ideas, a project is composed of atomic blocks of work. And those units of work are built from atomic blocks of expertise, risks, expectations, and other output from the tools presented in this rBook.

- **Atomic Project Management** allows us to work squarely facing our greatest constraint: our time in this world.
	 - I see the lifetime in front of me as containers of blocks. Only a small portion of those are for units of work, the units that bring ideas to reality. Those containers could only be filled once, so I value tools that help me fill those containers with the right blocks of work.

		 - > Whether your goal for studying project management is to earn more, to build a future for yourself and the people you love, or to say Yes to a calling, my hope in writing this rBook is that these tools will be useful in that journey.
