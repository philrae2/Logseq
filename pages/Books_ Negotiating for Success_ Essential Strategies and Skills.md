- Chapter 1: Decide Whether to Negotiate
	 - Before beginning a negotiation, ask yourself the following quetions:
		 - Are you comfortable negotiating in this situation?

		 - Do benefits from the negotiation outweigh the costs, such as your time commitment?

		 - Do the rewards justify the risks, such as losing a job offer?

- Chapter 2: Determine the Type of Negotiation
	 - Decide whether the negotiation is [[position-based]] or [[interest-based]].
		 - An example of  position-based negotiation is when we are fighting over a pizza. My position is that the pizza belongs to me, while you think you should get the pizza. 

		 - An interest-based negotiation is when we asks our interests in the pizza is. For example I may I prefer crusts, and you hate crusts. The solution would be different from a position-based negotiation where the pizza may be cut in half.
			 - Dividing the pizza as a solution maybe termed as "distributive" negotiation because it involves distributing the pieces of a fixed-size pie, while enlarging the pizza is called "integrative" negotiation because the goal is to expand the pizza by integrating the parties' interests. 

			 - Other experts refer to dividing the pizza as claiming value (you want to get the largest piece of a fixed-sized value) and expanding the pizza as creating value (by building a larger pizza). The latter solution is a key business ideal.

		 - Even if we think the negotiation is position based, try to find interests in parties to attempt a move to an interest based negotiation.

	 - Decide whether the negotiation involves a deal or resolving a dispute
		 - [[Deal-making]] negotiations look to the future. The emphasis is on problem-solving and on identifying the parties' interests. 

		 - [[Dispute resolution]] negotiation looks to the past with a focus on positions and on claiming value in an adversarial manner.
			 - A dispute resolution can be converted into an a deal-based negotiation by looking for interests that can be integrated to benefit both sides.

	 - Types of Dispute-Resolution Processes
		 - __Avoidance__ Resolution can result when one party avoids the dispute by conceding to the other side

		 - __Mediation__ Mediation is much like negotiation except with a third party, the mediator, assists the parties in resolving the dispute. 

		 - __Arbitration__ Also involves a third party but, unlike mediation, the third party--the arbitrator--has authority to reach a decision in the dispute. Under the typical arbitration process, the disputing parties must abide by the decision.

		 - __Litigation__ As with arbitration, the third party--the judge--has the authority to reach a decision. Unlike arbitration, the proceedings are public. This is the least liked option by businesses as it costs substantial time and money. 

		 - __Power__ Parties in a powerful position can force the other side to do what they want. 

	 - Assess your negotiation partner's negotiation style
		 - Perform a gap analysis to understand how your negotiation styles differ from your counterpart's style.

- Chapter 3: Conduct a Negotiation Analysis
	 - Ask Six Questions When Conducting A Negotiation Analysis
		 - Asking questions is important in negotiations, but diluted when we do not have benchmarks in mind that will enable us to evaluate the answers we receive.

		 - __What is my overall goal in the negotiation? Why is this your goal?__

		 - __What issues are most important to me in reaching this goal and why are these issues important?__

		 - __What is my Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement__ Stated in another way, what is the best alternative if there is no deal? Identifying the best alternative is important because this is what gives us leverage in the negotiation. 

		 - __What is my reservation price__ This is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay or the lowest price a seller is willing to take. 

		 - __What is the most likely price?__

		 - __What is my stretch goal?__
			 - Generally, negotiators who set the most ambitious stretch goals are the most successful in negotiations, with one important caveat. If you have no factual basis for your stretch goal, we risk losing credibility with the other side.

	 - When looking at the psychology of negotiation, great negotiators have the ability to look at a negotiation from the perspective of the other side.

		 - The Zone of Potential is in which the deal can take place.
