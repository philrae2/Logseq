	- In an industry filled with companies dedicated to "making the
	  world a better place," Palantir sees itself as the best and brightest: the
	  company that hires the smartest engineers to solve the world's big-
	  gest problems, such as fingering terrorists, spotting fraud, negotiat-
	  ing underwater mortgages, and distributing humanitarian relief. For
	  today's world-conquering technologists, all these problems have to
	  do with Big Data- how to access its informational value for maxi ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0p9md106bsf9wzavdcg02xa))

	- The company also embraces its own version of the Valley's fabled
	  "flat hierarchy" workplace- meaning that, apart from a handful of
	  founders and directors, it operates without the benefit of an org chart
	  or a rigid management structure. "There are no leashes at Palantir,"
	  says a company statement about its engineering culture. "We work on
	  flat, decentralized teams, each with decision-making authority, and
	  our people have the freedom to approach, own, and solve problems
	  creatively." Under this regime of rhetorical worker empowerment, for-
	  ward-deployed teams act autonomously, and engineers are entrepre-
	  neurs who sell clients on the product (instead of relying on salespeo-
	  ple). The idea, according to the company's managerial ethos, is for the
	  "best idea," rather than the most powerful person, to win ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0p9wrcgzsyv98wtaz6gvb16))
	- Johnstone rails against traditional education
	  in a vein worthy of Thiel's renowned dismissal of college degrees. Our
	  compulsory school system produces rigid conformists who anxiously
	  seek to behave according to scripts furnished by their social betters,
	  Johnstone observes. Improvisational theater seeks to disrupt these
	  schooling-bred rituals of deference to allow the creative genie within
	  to emerge. "In a normal education, everything is designed to suppress
	  spontaneity," Johnstone writes, "but I wanted to develop it." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0pa0a6z82y86kh15mapxfnv))
	- Curiously, though, he's not out to smash the underlying hierarchi-
	  cal system but to exploit it. In the following chapter, Johnstone explores
	  how knowing one's status relative to others is crucial to finding one's
	  character. Humans are "pecking-order animals" down to "the tiniest
	  details of our behavior," so it should come as no surprise that status
	  awareness is crucial to acting, as in every other arena of life:
	  Although this short essay is no more than an introduction, by now it
	  will be clear to you that status transactions aren't only of interest to the
	  improviser. Once you understand that every sound and posture implies
	  a status, then you perceive the world quite differently, and the change is
	  probably permanent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0pa19nrk11vbhfdht8qjhge))
	- In improvisation, Johnstone goes on to argue, the key to facilitat-
	  ing spontaneous and creative play is "saying yes" to those you're work-
	  ing with. That is, when your acting partner "makes an offer" by ask-
	  ing a question or suggesting a line of conversation, you should follow.
	  The rival impulse to say no is a nonstarter in a creative work setting; it
	  either blocks the prospective opening or deflects it to some other, pre-
	  sumably safer, agenda item. The best improvisers "overaccept" and roll
	  with it; the bad ones are "naysayers" and make other actors' jobs harder.
	  "Reading about spontaneity won't make you more spontaneous, "John-
	  stone writes. "But it may at least stop you heading off in the opposite
	  direction." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0pa42mxzk4234kb0q5q9h4f))
	- So here, in short, are the central takeaways of Impro for Palantir's
	  ambitious corps of FDEs:
	  • Your education and upbringing have ruined your genius.
	  • In every interaction, it's crucial to know your status relative to others
	  and embrace that role.
	  • The key to unleashing creativity is saying yes and overaccepting.
	  • You have attained true creative genius when your personality has
	  been disrupted, you have a feeling of decisionlessness, and you are so
	  absorbed in the work that you feel possessed.
	  In other words, to become a great Palantirian- a title-less, autono-
	  mous, creative Übermensch- you have to leave your prior self behind,
	  embrace your role, know your status, and reconfigure your personality
	  to the core dictates of your work. We can perhaps now understand the
	  concern of the investor who reportedly asked Dr. Karp, "Is this a com-
	  pany or a cult? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0pah73rdgmybdzeh9vcfgjd))
