- Introduction
	 - [[feedback]] is any information you get about yourself. It's how we learn about ourselves from our experiences and from other people.

	 - [[feedback]] is not only what gets ranked; it's also what gets thanked, commented on, and invited back or dropped. Feedback can be formal or informal, direct or implicit; it can be blunt or baroque, totally obvious or so subtle that we're not sure of it

	 - The key variable in [[growth]] is you and not other people like your teacher or supervisor. **It's good to hope for a mentor or coach, but don't put off learning until they arrive. **Those exceptional teachers and mentors are rare.

	 - **We are wired for learning, but learning about ourselves can be challenging.**

	 - Receiving [[feedback]] sits on the intersection between two needs contentious-our drive to learn and our longing for acceptance.

	 - [[feedback]] seeking behavior has been linked to higher job satisfaction, greater creativity on the job, faster adaptation in a new organization or role, and lower turnover. Seeking out negative feedback is associated with higher performance ratings.

	 - ^^The [[modeling]] behavior becomes more important as you move up in an organization. Nothing affects the learning culture more than the skill with which its executive team receives feedback.^^

- Feedback challenge - Chapter 1
	 - The first task in assessing feedback is figuring out what kind of feedback we are receiving. 
		 - appreciation (thanks)

		 - coaching (here's a better way to do it)

		 - evaluation (here's where you stand)

	 - Often the receiver wants or hears one kind of feedback, while the giver actually means another. 
		 - Understand the feedback first before you figure out what to do with it. Go under the surface meaning and try to see what are the motivations behind the feedback. 
			 - to better understand other's feedback, grow awareness of your [[blindspot]]s

	 - Three feedback triggers that each provokes a different set of reactions and responses from us.
		 - **truth triggers:** the feedback is wrong, unfair and unhelpful
			 - separate appreciation, coaching and evaluation

			 - first understand the feedback and ask for more clarification in case there is a misunderstanding or miscommunication

		 - **relationship triggers:** I can't hear feedback from you
			 - our perception of feedback is inevitably influenced and tainted by who is giving it to us. 

			 - To receive this feedback is to disentangle the feedback from its giver

			 - Be cognizant of your own personality and the giver's and the relationship you both have with each other

		 - **identity triggers**: the feedback is threatening and puts us off balance
			 - to receive this type of feedback, know your temperament and the possible distortion you may place on the feedback given

			 - cultivate a [[growth]] identity
				 - not everything at work is a test or an assessment of you. 

				 - having a growth mindset means that we see ourselves as evolving for the better. How we are now is not our core identity because we are striving to better, so feedback is always welcomed. 
					 - We welcome challenges and failures as they are the best ways to [[learn]] and [[improve]].

- 2. Separate appreciation, coaching, and evaluation - three types of feedback
	 - on receiving [[feedback]], our responses don't always hinge on the skill of the giver or even what is being said, rather, they're based on how we are hearing what's said and which kind of feedback we think we are getting.

	 - [[appreciation]] - about relationships and human connections. Being seen, feeling understood, matters deeply. Appreciation motivates us. 
		 - Coaching is difficult to receive if the person does not receive or feels appreciation.

		 - Three qualities are required for appreciation:
			 - Appreciation is specific

			 - Appreciation has to come in a form the receiver values and hears clearly.

			 - Meaningful appreciation has to be authentic

	 - [[coaching]] - when we ask our boss for more direction, we're asking for coaching. Coaching is aimed at trying to help someone learn, grow, or change.  The focus is on helping the person improve, whether it involves a skill, an idea, knowledge, a particular practice, or that person's appearance or personality
		 - There are to motivations for coaching.
			 - One is the need to improve your knowledge or skills in order to build capability  and meet novel challenges.

			 - Second is identifying a problem in your relationship. This type of coaching feedback is often prompted by emotion: hurt, fear, anger, confusion...The giver wants this situation to change and therefore you to also change.

		 - There's always a form of evaluation when we are coaching. That maybe received louder than the actual coaching feedback. 

		 - [[evaluation]] is another type of feedback. It assessment, ranking or rating. Evaluations are always in some respect comparisons, implicitly or explicitly, against others or against a particular set of standards.
			 - Evaluations align expectations, clarify consequences, and inform decision making. 

			 - It's smart to avoid evaluation when our intention is to coach. However, before we can receive coaching or appreciation, we need to know where we stand (**evaluation provides a foundation for coaching and appreciation to stand on**) and if the relationship is going to last. 

	 - When receiving feedback take care to clarify what kind of feedback it is. 

	 - Get aligned: Know the purpose and discuss it
		 - Cross-transactions happen when the giver and receiver are misaligned. The fix? Discuss the purpose of the feedback explicitly
			 - Ask yourself three questions:

			 - What's my purpose in giving/receiving feedback?

			 - Is it the right purpose from my point of view?

			 - Is it the right purpose from the other person's point of view?

	 - Minimize evaluation from coaching and appreciation
		 - The evaluation conversation comes first, then separated by coaching and appreciation by days. We can't focus on how to improve until we we know where we stand. 

- 3. First Understand - Shift from "That's Wrong" To "Tell Me More"
	 - Before we determine whether feedback is right or wrong, we first have to understand it. 

	 - When giving feedback be specific and invite questions for clarity. "Let me describe what I mean and you can ask me questions to see if I'm making sense." Give examples.

	 - For clarifications ask where the feedback is coming from and 
		 - where the feedback is going. (the change requested)

	 - Human intelligence is organized around [[stories]]. We take in selective data and make immediate [[interpretation]]s, resulting in instant judgement labels

	 - Shift from wrong spotting to difference spotting
		 - Instead of dismissing "wrong" feedback ask why there is a difference in interpretation. ^^Even though we may have access to the same data that prompted the feedback, we have differences in interpretation.^^

		 - ^^We may also have access to different data that informs our feedback. Ask for the data that you may not be seeing.^^

		 - One of the primary reasons we interpret data differently is that we have different rules in our heads about how things should be. But we don't think of them as our rules. We think of them as the rules.

		 - [[difference spotting]] - understanding as specifically as you can exactly why there is a difference in viewpoints

	 - **You can still disagree to the feedback after understanding it. **

	 - When feedback diverges into two different topics acknowledge that it diverged and address each one separately
		 - An edge should be given to the first topic first, unless the second topic is triggering you and are unable to have a good discussion unless it's addressed first

	 - Listen for the relationship issues lurking beneath their "advice"
		 - We may stay in the giver's topic but we may misunderstand the subtext. They may say the are offering "friendly advice" but are really talking about a relationship issue 

		 - When we receive coaching, ask ourselves, Is this about helping me grow and improve, or is this the giver's way of raising an important relationship issue that is upsetting them.

	 - ^^Ask "What are you worried about" and dig deeper to their answer's motivations.^^

- 6. Identify the Relationship System
	 - Feedback is often prompted by a problem: Something isn't working. Something isn't right. 

	 - We are all participants in a problem but we only see part of the problem (the part the other person is contributing)

	 - Using systems thinking for feedbacks and relationships
		 - One step back: You plus me intersections
			 - Feedback is often expressed as "This is how you are, and that's the problem." But in relationships, "This is how you are" really means "This is how you are in relation to how I am. Its the combination--the intersection of our differences--that is often causing the problem. 

			 - Taking one step back means stepping outside your own perspective to observe the system, instead of focusing on what the other person is doing, notice what are each doing in reaction to the other. 

			 - The first step back looks at you and the other person, and the way your tendencies interact and intersect.

		 - Two steps back: Role clashes and accidental adversaries
			 - Its important to see how our roles are contributing to how we see each other, and to the feedback we give each other. How much is role, and how much is personality and performance.

		 - Three steps back: The big picture (other players, processes, policies, and structures)
			 - The third step back enable us to take in the big picture, which includes not only other players but also the physical environment, timing and decision making, policies, processes, and workaround coping strategies. All of these influence behavior and decisions, and the feedback we give one another. 

			 - We can't take meaningful responsibility for causing a problem until we understand the combination of factors that actually caused the problem. A systems approach helps us clarify choices and actions, and how they created the outcomes. 

			 - Taking the blame is unhealthy and prevents learning. We can accept feedback too quickly  and fail too explore intersections, roles, choices, and reactions that created the problem under discussion. If you soak up all the responsibility, you let others off the hook. Responsibility for learning and fixing the problem is hoarded and the best solutions less likely to emerge.

			 - Understanding the whole system allows us to fix the problem. When we have a limited view of the system, we may the mistake of expecting an adjustment to the system to solve the whole problem, not noticing that a better adjustment exists outside our scope of knowledge.
				 - We may place undue attention to one part of the system of a wholistic system view, resulting in unsound solutions that may work on the short term but spell disaster in the future. 

- 7. How our brains and temperament affect our story

- 8. Dismantle Distortions
	 - > One of the biggest blocks to receiving feedback well is that we exaggerate it. Fueled by emotion, our story about what the feedback says about us grows so large and so damming that we are overwhelmed by it.

	 - In order to understand and assess the feedback, we first have to dismantle the distortions. 

	 - Five ways to dismantle distortions
		 - **1. Be prepared, be mindful**
			 - Know how you react to feedback. Mentally prepare yourself to hear bad news to be able to react accordingly. 

		 - **2. Separate the strands: feeling, story, and feedback**
			 - > As you get better at slowing things down and noticing what's going on in your mind and body, you can begin to sort through your reactions. You'll get better at distinguishing your emotions from the story you tell about the feedback, and distinguishing both of these from what the feedback giver actually said.
				 - __What do I feel?__

				 - __What's the story I'm telling (and inside that story, what's the threat)?__

				 - __What's the actual feedback?__

		 - 3. Containg the story
			 - Time: The present does not change the past. The present influences, but does not determine, the future

			 - Specificity:  Being lousy at one thing does not make us lousy at unrelated things. Being lousy at something doesn't' mean we'll always be lousy at it.

			 - People: If one person doesn't like us it doesn't mean everyone doesn't like us. Even a person who doesn't like us usually likes some things about us. And people's views of us can change over time. 

			 - **Contain the feedback and ask yourself What this and isn't about?**

			 - **Visually show your feedback when you over emphasize the negative feedback, when you have more much positive ones. **

		 - 4. Change your vantage point
			 - Look back from the future

		 - 5. Accept that you can't control how others see you
			 - > We can be obsessed with the desire to get others to admit they are wrong and to change their views about us. We can't change their views, no matter how wrong and unfair their view of you.

			 - Have compassion for them. Empath has a profound effect on how see another person and hear their feedback. 

- 9.  Cultivate a growth identity
	 - > Learning profitably from feedback is not only how we interpret the feedback; it's also about how we hold our identity. 

	 - Acknowledge that we contribute to the problem of feedback (negative). When we accept that we're not perfect we also means that we can't escape negative feedback.

	 - Learning from feedback means to recognize that the labels we put on ourselves are simplifications. We need to let go of black and whiteâ€”all or nothing identities. We're more complicated than that. 

	 - Shift from a [[fixed mindset]] to a ((deee5d66-a484-417d-b68e-090b72e03d96))
		 - People get better when they apply themselves to a difficult problem or situation and people apply themselves when they believe they can get better. Their mindset is not fixed. #blck:yellow

		 - The accuracy of our [[self-perception]] affects our learning of handling feedback, especially how we see our current capabilities.
			 - Growth identity allows us to shake off negative contradictory events of failure and successes as temporal and not attached to our self-perception and identity. They are more motivated to seek accurate information to adjust and learn. 

	 - Sort and categorize feedback as coaching even if they aren't. We are less triggered by coaching if we are motivated to improve and learn. #blck:red

	 - Be aware of how others perceive your feedback and state explicitly your intention. #blck:red

	 - Unpack Judgment from evaluation
		 - [[Evaluation]] can be broken down into:
			 - [[assessment]]: ranks you. It tells you where you stand.

			 - [[consequence]]s are about the real-world outcomes that result from assessments

			 - [[judgment]] is the story givers and receivers tell about the assessment and its consequences. 

			 - By looking at the components of  evaluation we can identify which is triggering your [[identity]].

	 - Give yourself a second chance evaluation to how you react to the initial feedback
		 - While the initial feedback may not be in our control, our reaction usually is and learning from feedback is more important for growth and improvement, that our first [[self-evaluation]].
			 - We can make learning and improving from feedback as part of our core identity. 

- 10. How good do I have to be
	 - Being able to establish limits on the feedback you receive is crucial to our well-being and the health of our relationships. If we can't say no our yeses are not freely chosen. #blck:yellow

	 - Three boundaries of [[ feedback]]:
		 - I may not take your advice
			 - We may be willing to listen and consider input but we may not implement their advice

		 - I don't want feedback about that subject, not right now (maybe never)

		 - Stop or I will leave this relationship

	 - Turning away feedback with grace and honesty
		 - The biggest mistake we make when trying to create boundaries is that we assume other people understand what's going on with us. But often they dont.

		 - Be transparent: actually tell them. 

		 - Be firm and appreciative of their feedback. 

		 - Redirect unhelpful coaching to something that may actually help

		 - Be specific about the redirection or request to turn away feedback. Consider the request, the time frame, their assent, and describe the consequences

		 - If you decide not to change, minimize your impact on others. Problem solve together and open the discussion. 

- Chapter 11 - Navigate the Conversation
	 - Feedback conversations are made up of three parts:
		 - **open**: What is the purpose of the conversation? What kind of feedback would I like, and what kind is my giver trying to give? Is the feedback negotiable or final, a friendly suggestion or a command?
			 - if you're aware of the type of conversation you're having you can diminish your reflexive retorts or hasty retreats that can harm your relationships

			 - try to uncover the underlying motivation for this conversation. What exactly is the giver's purpose?

			 - **we can influence the frame and agenda** 
				 - We often assume that the person receiving the feedback has no influence on the direction and goal of the conversation. If we disagree, we can reframe the conversation. 

				 - We can make sure that the opening of the conversation is respectful for both parties. MIT research found a correlation between skilled interaction during the first five minutes of a negotiations and good outcomes.

				 - Correcting the course up front is about process, not substance. You're not telling the feedback giver what they can or can't say; you're working to clarify the mutual purpose of the conversation and suggesting a two-way exploration. This helps you get aligned for the rest of the conversation. 

		 - Body
			 - **There are four skills necessary for managing the conversation**
				 - [[listening]]: includes asking clarifying questions, paraphrasing the giver's view, and acknowledging their feelings

				 - [[asserting]]: is a combination of sharing, advocating, and expressing â€”in essence, talking.
					 - Don't confuse assertion "asserting the truth" or with being certain. ^^We can be assertive with our point of view, we can even assert our feeling of doubt.^^ Assertion in this context is sticking up for yourself and your opinions and beliefs. 

				 - process moves are events in the conversation that steers it to a more productive discussion. In this process we are acting as our own referee, stepping outside the conversation, noticing where we and the giver are stuck, and suggesting a better direction, topic, or process. 

				 - problem solving is when we decide what to do with the feedback and how to respond.

			 - We are wired for empathy but only for those, we can relate with or for those treated unfairly. This knowledge is helpful when our internal voice will start to act like a bodyguard when the feedback we receive is construed as unfair by our internal voice. Internally we will empathize with ourselves instead of our conversation partner.
				 - If we're going to listen more effectively, it has to be fueled by a purpose. We'll have to find or create a sense of curiosity getting valuable feedback from a conversation we feel is treating us unfairly.  We can shift from a mindset of wrong spotting to listening for what's right and cultivate curiosity about why we are seeing things differently from our conversation partner. 

				 - To prepare a difficult conversation, prepare appropriately to listen.
					 - Discover your triggers and the patterns that set them off, then have an internal dialogue with your inner voice to create curiosity. We want to receive and uncover valuable feedback from our conversations where we may feel attacked. We can remind ourselves understanding doesn't mean agreeing.  

			 - The **second** purpose of [[listening]]: is to let them know you hear them. We are listening **first** and foremost to understand.  Listening rewards the giver's effort in taking the time to give you feedback, and it leaves them feeling reassured that they communicated clearly. 
				 - Interrupting periodically (to ensure that you understand the giver, rather than to assert your contrasting view) can be a sign that you are listening well.

				 - **Assert what's left out**
					 - Feedback is not simply a thing the giver hands you and you receive. You and the giver are working on a problem together and both of you have information to share. If you don't assertâ€”you are withholding your piece of information that is needed to solve the problem. When you withhold your point of view and feelings, the giver is unaware of whether what they're saying is helpful, on target, or in line with your experiences. 

					 - Effective assertion requires a key mindset shift. Your goal is not to persuade the other person is wrong and that you're right, rather you're adding your piece of knowledge that they simply are unaware of to complete the puzzle. Be aware that you maybe missing critical information the other person may have to understand the situation or problem clearly.

					 - **Common Assertion Mistakes**
						 - Truth mistakes: If you don't think the truth is being shared, it's okay to disagree with it, however, don't flat out call it wrong or lying. You could be mistaken or wrong yourself.

						 - Relationship mistakes: Avoid switch tracking. Also, avoid blaming. Take responsibility of your contributions to the problem. 

						 - Identity Mistakes: When we're off balance or overwhelmed, our assertions are more likely to tip into exaggeration. When we don't agree with the feedback we may want to cut out the feedback or dismiss it through exaggeration and sarcasm. Always be thankful for the feedback. 

					 - **Be your own process referee**
						 - Be aware of the conversation between you and your conversation partner. Actively manage the conversation by observing the discussion, diagnosing where it may go wrong, and make explicit process interventions to course correct. Be careful not to manipulate the conversation for your own advantage, but intentional in making your conversation partner felt heard.    

		 - Close - Problem solve to create possibilities
			 - Sometimes even when the feedback is right, we may feel that we simply cannot act on it because the cost of doing so is too high. But often we can create new possibilities even where there don't seem to be any. To create options look for each party's underlying interest in the feedback.
				 - __Three sources of interests behind feedback__
					 - helping you - the giver sees ways you could improve and opportunities to accelerate your growth and learning curve. Or they may want to protect you from potential problems or dangers that they see but you don't

					 - helping themselves and the relationship: the giver maybe giving you feedback because they feel upset, lonely, angry, disappointed, or hurt by you. The feedback is about you and your behavior but the interests involved may point back at them. 

					 - helping the organization/team/family/someone else: sometimes feedback is motivated by helping or protecting someone or something beyond you or your conversation partner. 

					 - To solve problems we need to understand the real interests. Once we have the underlying interests uncovered, along with whose interests are involved, then we can start to create options that both meet yours and your partner. First, be explicit about what you're trying to accomplish. 

			 - **Close with commitment**
				 - When a feedback conversation ends, make sure to agree on the clearly identified terms and next steps. If we are not explicit in the agreement, we may be disappointed by the lack of progress or confused about the other person's expectations. The goal is clarity not necessarily a specific action of change. 

				 - Dependent on the formality we can gain agreement on the 
					 - action plan: 

					 - Who does what next

					 - benchmark and consequences: how will progress be measured and when

					 - procedural contracts: follow up meetings ?

					 - strategies: formulate new ways to work around each other's habits, failure or foibles

				 - Feedback conversations are a series of conversations not a one shot deal where a solution is found.

			 - If you're unsure about the quality of a feedback, especially when your way of doing things is going well, you can experiment to test out the outcomes, especially when the risk and consequences are low 

		 - **Coach your coach**
			 - Your aim to coach is to find ways that you and your feedback giver can communicate feedback clearly and the implement them effectively. Find the most efficient ways to learn with your help from your coach.  

	 - Influencing decisions based on a plan.
		 - When we present a plan, we can create more buy-in, if we promote a collaborative approach. When you propose your plan and list its benefits, also acknowledge the drawbacks from the stakeholders. We can get more buy-in if decision-makers feel like they had a hand in making the plan. 

	 - Create multi-track activities to gain feedback

	 - **Talking about negative behavior often has the unintended effect of reinforcing it as the social norm, while highlighting good norms does more to change disliked behaviors than calling out bad norms.
		 - Rather than issue out a negative email of "31 percent of you still haven't completed your reviews", its more effective to crow, "69 percent of you have completed your reviews. Thank you!"

- As givers manage mindset and identity
	 - Feedback may be hurtful in the short-term, but beneficial in the long-term. Withholding feedback is more harmful than good
