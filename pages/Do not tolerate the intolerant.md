- **Note:**
	 - Intolerance and authoritarian personality kills the democratic  process. This can spill over to the work environment in collaborative problem solving. 

	 - Authority can silence ideas and prevent idea generation.

	 - When you see intolerance and authoritarian behavior, expose it and try to dismantle it.

	 - [[Don't fear that you maybe the minority trying to enact change.]]
