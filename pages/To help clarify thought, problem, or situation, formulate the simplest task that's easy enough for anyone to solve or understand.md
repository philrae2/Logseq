	 - To design an algorithm that demonstrates a sophisticated skill, it is helpful to formulate a task that’s simple enough for a human to easily solve while pushing to the extreme the level of skill required of a general algorithmic solution not specialized to the task.

		 - John Horton, a faculty member at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a former student and coauthor of Richard’s, used this simplicity maxim to tackle a question he was trying to understand in the ride-sharing market (Uber, Lyft, etc.): From a societal perspective, should drivers know where a passenger is going when they decide whether to take a trip? On the one hand, knowing that information allows drivers to accept the “good” trips and not the “bad” ones. If many drivers do this, the wait-time for “bad” trips could be very long or, even worse, passengers needing “bad” trips might never get picked up. On the other hand, if drivers differ in their costs (for example, it is cheaper to pick up a passenger going your way as your day is ending), letting them pick and choose among trips can be economically efficient; the trip will go to a driver for whom the trip is more beneficial. Creating a model that fully captures all such relevant parameters can get very complicated very fast.

		 - John simplified the problem by assuming that there are just two kinds of trips, “good” and “bad,” and the two types are equally likely. He also assumed that drivers only have two possible strategies: 1) accept all trips, or 2) accept “good” trips and reject “bad” ones. By simplifying the problem (two kind of trips, two strategies only), he gained insights he would not be able to get otherwise.

- **Note:**
	 - When our thinking about a problem is too complex, we can try to understand the problem or situation through simplification of the possible solution or a simplification of variables/factors
