	- Chapter 1 - Diplomacy
	  collapsed:: true
		- Takeaways:
			- Some faults of the book is the assumption of the examples are that the two conversation partners agree on the same definition, but the author doesn't touch on this. For example in his conversation of abortion he doesn't define when the beginning of life starts. A conversation on abortion cannot happen if one side don't agree on when a "baby" is a "baby". The author assumes he is in control of the abortion example by assumption. They don't also talk about when the abortion would occur? Does the Wiccan lady agree on abortion late term or only very early on of the pregnancy? The example does not clarify this and hurts this example.
		- Ambassador Model
			- A curious and kind approach to diplomacy rather than confrontation.
			- Beware when rhetoric becomes a substitute for substance. You always know that a person has a weak position when he tries to accomplish with the clever use of words what argument alone cannot do.
			- The value of a tactical approach is staying in the drivers seat in conversations so you can productively direct the discussion, exposing faulty thinking and suggesting more fruitful alternatives along the way.
		- Tactics
			- Tactics can allow us to have difficult conversations. They help us to be reasonable and thoughtful, instead of only emotional.
			- **The tactical approach requires as much careful listening as thoughtful response.**
			- **You have to be alert and pay attention so you can adapt to new information.**
	- Chapter 2 - Reservations
	  collapsed:: true
		- If anyone in the discussion gets angry you you lose. People who are angry get defensive, and defensive people are not in a very good position to think about whether or not your ideas are good ones. Instead, they are too interested in defending their position.
		- It's a good idea to avoid quarrels. Rather, we're to be kind, patient, and gentle toward our opposition.
		- The mind, not the Bible,  is the very first line of defense God has given us against error.
		- Jesus said, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength" (Mark 12:30). Loving God with the mind is not a passive process. It is not enough to have sentimental religious thoughts. Rather it involves coming to conclusions about God and his world based on revelation, observation, and careful reflection.
		- The ability to argue is vital for clear thinking. It helps us test our thinking, learn new things, and importantly teaches us discard old ways of thinking and to not attach to one way of thinking.
		- We need to learn how to argue in a principle wayâ€”fairly, reasonably, and graciously. We need to cultivate the ability to disagree with civility and not to take opposition personally. We also need to have grace to allow our own views to be challenged.
			- Those who refuse to dispute have a poor chance of growing in their understanding of truth.
		- Arguments are good, and dispute is healthy. They clarify the truth and protect us from error and religious despotism. When the church discourages principle debates and a free flow of ideas, the result is shallow Christianity and a false sense of unity.
	- Chapter 3 - Ask Questions
	  collapsed:: true
		- When in a discussion and you need to think of a reply in a short window. Ask questions instead of making statements. Don't preach about your views or disagree. Draw out your conversation partner instead.
		  collapsed:: true
			- Asking questions protect you from making assumptions and early conclusions.
			- > Asking questions help you escape the charge of "twisting other people's words."  Questions help provide everyone with clarity and helps you understand their point of view better.
			- Try to understand the person's point of view first and the consequences of that view first before offering your opinion. If you fail to understand their point of view, then your opinion is going to be poor.
				- Simply never make statement, at least at first, when a question will do.
			- In conversations we have, ask more questions than statements. The question here is can we lead a conversation with simply questions? Can we make a point with simply more questions than statements?
				- By asking questions we are portraying a sense of interest in that person and what they have to say. They will feel flattered you are asking questions, often their opinions are not solicited.
				- Asking questions leave you more educated than before having the conversation.
				- Asking questions puts you in the driver seat of the conversation.
		- What do you mean by that?
			- Define the topic by asking questions. Don't assume you have the same shared understanding and meaning.
			- By asking this question you avoid misunderstanding and misrepresentation.
		- Pay attention to the responses to your questions. Don't be afraid to reply with more questions if you still don't fully understand and need more clarification.
			- You can also feedback or repeat their answer to ensure you understand what they've said.
	- Chapter 4 - The Burden of Proof
		- Whoever makes a claim has the burden of proof. It's not your job to prove the person wrong if they make a claim, it's their job to defend their position.
		- An argument needs supporting evidence. Be careful to discern between an argument and an assertion. Assertions are merely statements without evidence. An argument gives supporting reasons why it should be taken seriously. An assertion without evidence is not useful.
		- Ask "How did you come to that conclusion?" to find the flaw in someone's reasoning
			- Is a question that enforces the burden of proof for the person who made a claim.
			- Giving an explanation is not the same thing as giving an argument or refuting someone else's argument.
				- If someone offers up an explanation ask yourself if it is possible, plausible and probable.
					- It's possible that a room of monkeys with type writers could write Hamlet, but that doesn't mean its probable and a more likely reason existsâ€”that Shakespeare wrote Hamlet.
			- Assess the journey and reasoning of their conclusion:
				- Is there a misstep, a [[non sequitur]], a fallacy, or failing of some sort?
				- Can you challenge any underlying assumptions that maybe faulty?
				- Whatever you discover, address the issue with a question not a statement.
		- The professor's ploy.
			- People with authority and position may use their title and positions as a means to redirect the burden of proof back to you even though you may not have made a claim or an argument. Don't let authority or positions of power be a reason for someone to lay a claim
		- When you feel like you can't conversate about the issue because your lack of knowledge and expertise. Feel free to say "you'd like more time to think about and educate yourself on the topic." Acknowledge the situation and that the person whom you're talking to maybe more manageable and that you will need them to slow down to explain themselves and for you to digest the information.
	- Chapter 5 - Leading the Way
	  collapsed:: true
		- Every time you ask a question and get a favorable response they're telling you that they understand the point your making. With each successive leading question, you can lead your conversation partner how you arrive at your conclusion.
			- It is easier to convince someone when the steps to a conclusion are clear and reasonable.
		- The most powerful and most persuasive type of questions are the ones that help people recall what they already know.
		- When discussing a topic, consider all the perspectives and not only what is the immediate topic at hand. For example the discussion of hell can constitute judgement, love, and importantly how the character of God is defined by these surrounding concepts.
		- Tolerance for Christianity is important because they have a defined set of characteristics that they claim to live up to and judge others by through condemnation either permanently in hell or non-existence. Christians are judged more stringently because of this.
			- Although tolerance goes both way, if one party is claiming some sense of righteousness and love, the concept of hypocrisy comes into play for that person.
		- To lead a conversation well you need to know the place where you want the conversation to go and the precise points the questions you're asking makes.
			- Do you want your questions to:
				- Clarify a point?
				- Convey new information?
				- Expose a weakness?
		- Gentle approaches to challenging someone's conclusion or point: #[[q: How to listen]]
			- Consider using the phrase "Have you you considered" to introduce your concern.
			- Another way to soften a challenge is to begin with "Can you clear this up for me?"
			- "Let me suggest and alternative and tell me if it's an improvement. If not, can you tell me why you think your option is better.
			- "I wouldn't characterize it that way. Here's what I think may be a better or more accurate way to look at it. Tell me what you think?
			- "I don't think that's going to work, I'd like to suggest why, is that okay with you?"
			- I'm not sure I agree with the way you put it. Think about this...
