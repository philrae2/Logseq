	- [[decision drift]] is when you decide something, but then your commitment drifts
		- What can cause decision drifts?
			- Some people don't know what they don't know. Which can then impact the future, when that unknown information becomes impactful.
			- Other people might have a sense of that there are impacts that aren't being discussed, but they can't put it into words.
			- Some people sense a lack of coherence. It bothers them and it becomes debilitating.
			- > Goals as a fix for decision drift: One reason for decision drift is that in the face of uncertain futures, we build "account for everything" systems instead of flexible playbooks. This is a big issue when planning for rapidly changing, uncertain future needs; "predict a path and build for it" breaks down easily when the predictions isn't exactly right.
	- Teams (and framework makers) focus a lot of attention on making decisions, but not a lot of time on understanding decisions and each other.
		- There's misunderstanding or gaps in shared vocabulary, shared understanding of implications and assumptions.
		- When problems and issues are known, there maybe friction in closing the gap.
	- There's no magic framework that can instantly solve the problem of working together effectively. People require time to processâ€”alone and together.
		- They need safety to challenge their own assumptions and the assumptions of team members. To explore and dig. In our day-to-day, there is so much pressure to decide quickly. The end result is premature decisions and incomplete information that make decisions fall apart with time.
