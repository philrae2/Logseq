title: Z: Don't face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply
---

- When people are throwing out solutions to problems, make sure that we took the time to understand the process and the perceived problem first. What people think are solutions to the problem may complicate it even more or not solve the issue because there is a lack of understanding.

- Decision making should also make sure that we fully understand the issue especially if it complex. Ask questions, How do know the information and beliefs we hold are true.
