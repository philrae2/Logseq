- **Note:**
	 - Data and research can be manipulated to bend "truth" and in due time the proposed truth from research and data can turn out false.

	 - The "truth" approaches "truthiness" the longer it survives. The more an idea, process, or knowledge remains unchanged for a significant period of time the more likely we can accept it as truth.
