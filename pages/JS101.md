- Lesson 2 - Truthiness
  collapsed:: true
	- Truthiness
		- The ability to express **true** or **false** is vital in any programming language. It helps us build conditional logic and to understand the state of an object or expression. Typically, we capture the notion of whether a value is true or false in a **boolean** data type. A boolean is an object whose only purpose is to convey whether it is true or false.
		- JavaScript uses the true and false primitive values as booleans. You can print them, assign them to variables, pass them around, and test them:
		- Copy Code
		- console.log(true);    // trueconsole.log(false);   // false
		  
		  function makeLonger(string, longer) {
		    if (longer) {
		      return string + string;
		    } else {
		      return string;
		    }}
		  
		  makeLonger("abc", true);  // 'abcabc'makeLonger("xyz", false); // 'xyz'
		  
		  function isDigit(char) {
		    if (char >= "0" && char <= "9") {
		      return true;
		    } else {
		      return false;
		    }}
		  
		  isDigit("5");  // trueisDigit("a");  // false
		  
		  if (value === true) {
		    console.log("It's true!");} else if (value === false) {
		    console.log("It's false!");} else {
		    console.log("It's not true or false!");}
	-
		- Expressions and Conditionals
		- In real code, you wouldn't usually use the true or false values directly in a conditional expression like value === true. Instead, you would merely evaluate an expression that should evaluate as either true or false. For instance:
		- Copy Code
		- let num = 5;
		  
		  if (num < 10) { // same as `if ((num < 10) === true)`
		    console.log("small number");} else {
		    console.log("large number");}
		- The above code outputs small number since num < 10 evaluates as true. We can verify that in the node REPL:
		- Copy Code
		- > let num = 5
		  > num < 10
		  = true
		  
		  > num = 12
		  > num < 10
		  = false
		- In much the same way, a function doesn't usually return true or false explicitly. Instead, it returns the result of a conditional expression. For instance:
		- Copy Code
		- function isSmall(number) {
		    return number < 10;}
		  
		  let num = 15;
		  
		  if (isSmall(num)) {
		    console.log("small number");} else {
		    console.log("large number");}
		- This code logs large number since isSmall(num) evaluates as false when num greater than or equal to 10.
	-
		- Logical Operators
		- Logical operators evaluate an expression that involves two subexpressions, then return a value that evaluates as true or false:
	-
		- The && Operator
		- **&&** is the **and** operator. It evaluates as true only when both sub-expressions evaluate as true:
		- Copy Code
		- > true && true              // true
		  > true && false             // false
		  > false && true             // false
		  > false && false            // false
		  
		  > let num = 5
		  > num < 10 && num > 3       // true
		  > num < 10 && num > 6       // false
		  > num > 10 && num < 6       // false
		  > num > 10 && num < 3       // false
		- Those results shouldn't be too surprising.
		- Note, though, that we didn't have to put subexpressions like num > 10 in parentheses. JavaScript's precedence rules treat > with higher precedence than &&. That means that it treats num < 10 && num > 3 as (num < 10) && (num > 3), not as num < (10 && (num > 3)) or num < ((10 && num) > 3).
		- The precedence rules can cause much confusion, especially if your concept of how to evaluate an expression differs from JavaScript's. Thus, it's a good idea to always use parentheses with expressions that involve multiple operators:
		- Copy Code
		- > (num < 10) && (num > 3)
		- The parentheses make your intent clear and prevent confusing situations.
		- You can chain as many sub-expressions as you'd like with &&; the sub-expressions get evaluated left to right. If any sub-expression is false, the entire && chain evaluates as false. The whole expression evaluates as true only when all of the sub-expressions evaluate as true:
		- Copy Code
		- > let num = 5
		  > (num < 10) && (num > 0) && ((num % 2) === 1)
		  = true
		  
		  > (num < 10) && (num > 0) && ((num % 2) === 1) && false
		  = false
	-
		- The || Operator
		- **||** is the **or** operator. It evaluates as true when either of the two sub-expressions evaluates as true; it evaluates as false when both sub-expressions evaluate as false.
		- Copy Code
		- > true || true              // true
		  > true || false             // true
		  > false || true             // true
		  > false || false            // false
		  
		  > let num = 5
		  > num < 10 || num > 3       // true
		  > num < 10 || num > 6       // true
		  > num > 10 || num < 6       // true
		  > num > 10 || num < 3       // false
		- Again, those results shouldn't be too surprising.
	-
		- Short-Circuit Operators
		- Both && and || exhibit a behavior called **short-circuiting**. That means that JavaScript stops evaluating sub-expressions once it can determine the final value. In the case of &&, JavaScript short-circuits when it realizes that the entire expression can't be true; that is, when it encounters a false sub-expression. With ||, it short-circuits when it realizes that the expression can't be false; that is, at least one sub-expression is true.
		- Consider &&: it short-circuits when it encounters the first sub-expression (from left-to-right) that evaluates as false:
		- Copy Code
		- > false && undefined.length
		  = false
		- Notice that the above code doesn't generate a TypeError even though the code includes the sub-expression undefined.length. By itself, undefined.length raises a TypeError. However, since the left side of the && guarantees that the entire expression can't be true, the right side never executes. Instead, the expression evaluates as false.
		- Conversely, this code does raise an exception:
		- Copy Code
		- > true && undefined.length
		  TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
		- Likewise, the || operator short-circuits when it encounters the first true sub-expression, again based on left-to-right evaluation:
		- Copy Code
		- > true || undefined.length
		  = true
		- The above code doesn't raise a TypeError since || didn't evaluate the second sub-expression; it short-circuited when true evaluated as true.
		- Relying on the short-circuit behavior can be dangerous, but it's sometimes handy. For instance, suppose you have a name variable that usually contains a string, but may sometimes contain null. Before you can use the string's length property, you must confirm that it isn't null:
		- Copy Code
		- if (name && (name.length > 0)) {
		    console.log(`Hi, ${name}.`);} else {
		    console.log("Hello, whoever you are.");}
		- This type of conditional expression often appears in real-life JavaScript code, so get familiar with it. In particular, make sure that you understand that JavaScript doesn't evaluate the right-side of a short-circuit operator when the expression short-circuits.
	-
		- Truthiness
		- The discussion so far should be mostly review. It's time to talk about the main topic of this assignment: what is **truthiness**, and how does it impact our code? We'll tackle that next.
		- After that review of booleans and logical operators, we're finally able to talk about the notion of **truthiness**. Truthiness differs from boolean values in that JavaScript evaluates almost all values as true. There are some exceptions, however:
			- false
			- undefined
			- null
			- 0
			- "" (an empty string)
			- NaN
		- All of these values evaluate as false. **Memorize** them!
		- Notice that we've repeatedly used the phrases __evaluated as true__ and __evaluated as false__. You can also use the terms **truthy** and **falsy** to describe the nature of the values. Be careful to make the same distinction in your own written and spoken communications. Saying that an expression returns true or false is not the same as saying that it returns a truthy or falsy value, or that it evaluates as true or false. The terms true and false refer to the Boolean values true and false; the other phrases refer to truthiness, that is, a truthy or falsy value.
		- Truthiness means that we can use any condition or logical expression:
		- Copy Code
		- let num = 5;if (num) {
		    console.log("valid number");} else {
		    console.log("error!");}
		- If you didn't know JavaScript at all, you might guess that the above code should either output error! or generate an error of its own. However, when you run that code, it outputs valid number. That's because JavaScript considers any non-zero (and non-NaN) number to be truthy. It does not, however, mean that num is equal to true:
		- Copy Code
		- console.log(num === true);        // => false
		- The use of truthy and falsy values sometimes leads to some surprising code:
		- Copy Code
		- let name;if (name = getNameFromUser()) {
		    console.log(`Hi ${name}`);} else {
		    console.log("you must enter your name!");}
		- Presumably, getNameFromUser solicits and returns the user's name and returns an empty string if the user doesn't enter a name. Since an empty string is falsy, we can test for a missing name by evaluating the assignment name = getNameFromUser(). If the user didn't enter her name, the expression evaluates as false, and the code logs you must enter your name!.
		- While this type of code is commonplace, most style guides strongly discourage. We at Launch School also discourage it. The code looks like it could be a mistake. Perhaps the programmer intended to write name == getNameFromUser() or name === getNameFromUser(). It's safer and more intentional to write:
		- Copy Code
		- let name = getNameFromUser();if (name) {
		    console.log(`Hi ${name}`);} else {
		    console.log("you must enter your name!");}
		- Better yet, make it clear that you're testing for an empty name:
		- Copy Code
		- let name = getNameFromUser();if (name === "") {
		    console.log("you must enter your name!");} else {
		    console.log(`Hi ${name}`);}

- Easy Exercise 1 Notes
  collapsed:: true
	- Finding the area of the room:
		- // METERS_OR_FEET from user input of either 'feet' or 'meters'
		- const IS_METERS = (METERS_OR_FEET.toLowerCase() === 'meters');
		- // LENGTH and WIDTH from user input - converted to numbers
		- const AREA = LENGTH * WIDTH;
		- // 1 meter is equal to 3.28084 feet
		- const SQM_TO_SQF = 3.28084**2;
		- // This is a math trick. We use the (**) operation with a nested ternary operation.
		- // If meters, then the conversion to sqm to sqf is valid. n to a power of 1 is equal to n
		- // If feet, then the conversion to sqm to sqf is inverted. n to a power of -1 is equal to 1/n
		- const AREA_CONV = AREA * SQM_TO_SQF ** (IS_METERS ? 1:-1);
	- [[Number.toFixed()]];
		- This method only works if the variable contains a number, so parseInt, parseFloat or Number any prompt assignments
		- ```javascript
		  let readlineSync = require("readline-sync");
		  
		  let bill = readlineSync.question("What is the bill?\n");
		  
		  let percentage = readlineSync.question("What is the tip percentage??\n");
		  
		  let tip = bill * (percentage / 100);
		  
		  let total = bill + tip;
		  
		  console.log(`The tip is $${tip.toFixed(2)}`);
		  console.log(`The total is $${total.toFixed(2)}`);
		  ```
			- If we entered values 200 and 15 for bill and percentage the tip would be calculated correctly as 30. The reason for this is that /, * and - operators implicitly coerce string operand to a number. Thus, if you added console.log(typeof tip === 'number') below the tip variable initialization, the output would be true. The value assigned to tip would be a number.
			- However, if we want to apply the same logic to let total = bill + tip; line, we would encounter a problem. Since bill is a string and since + performs concatenation when either operand is a string, the value assigned to total variable would be the string "20030". Finally, since total is a string it doesn't have a toFixed method and the final line of our program would raise an error.
	- [[Do While Loop]]
		- Be careful of using do while loops with an || condition as it may not act as you want.
			- Think carefully of the || and && logic
			- For example the following code had to be refactored to [[String.includes()]]
				- ```javascript
				  do {
				    multiplyOrAdd = rlsync.question("Enter \"s\" to compute the sum, or \"p\" to compute the product.");
				  } while (!["s","p"].includes(multiplyOrAdd.toLowerCase()))
				  ```
