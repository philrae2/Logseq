	- Slow Down To Innovate

		- "More so than most companies, Amazon thinks about creating value for customers, focusing specifically on how they can create unique and distinct products. Many companies get tripped up and think about innovation as something where they need to come up with ideas, quickly get them out and test them, in the sort of agile method of iterating quickly," says Carr.
		- But time and time again in Amazon's story, they went in the opposite direction. "Take AWS. It reached $10 billion in revenue [in less than four years](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/amazons-business-sales-marketplace-hits-10b-annual-revenue-reaching-milestone-faster-aws/). But what's remarkable is that they didn't get there by forming a team, writing a lot of code, and then testing and iterating. **In fact, it took more than 18 months before the engineers actually started to write code. Instead, they spent that time thinking deeply about the customers they were trying to serve and forming a clear vision for what AWS should be," he says.**
	- Brainstorm Around the Customer's Needs, Not Your Skillsets
	  collapsed:: true
		- Most companies take a skills-forward approach  to creating  business value and leveraging the skill-set they already have. Amazon on the other hand focused on the customer trends at that time.
		- For the e-books, they had to build their own hardware to read them and create a market. At that time, e-books selection was very small so there was no incentive buy e-book readers or digital copies of e-books.
		- Amazon was able to forecast from the current trends of iPods and the popularity of Napster for music trading and apply those lessons into e-books. They predicted that the convenience factor of the digital music market can also translate for music.
		- Instead of taking a skills-set approach they thought of creating something people would love and buy and did did even though they lacked the experience in the hardware arena.
		- With any new idea that you're developing, the customer should be front and center in everyone's mind â€” don't move on until you get that right.
	- Stay Flexible on the Detail, But Don't Let Innovation Become a Part-Time Job
	  collapsed:: true
		- **"Good ideas can get trapped inside big companies because they're not staffed to succeed. The challenge at any established company is that the demands of your core business will always soak up all of the bandwidth of your leaders."** This is where Amazon's solution of single-threaded leadership, or having a leader and team work on one thing and nothing else, comes in. "It gives them the appropriate focus to ensure they can devote time and attention to make the business a success," says Carr.
	- Build By Working Backwards
	  collapsed:: true
		- Create a mock press release for the product you're building to help you think through all the issues and details of the customer experience. Describe the customer experience we were going to create and clearly articulating the problem we were trying to solve.
		- Your process for finding new product ideas should come down to this: What helps you make the right decision to take the next step and figure out if A) this is the customer problem you want to solve, and B) this is the customer experience that solves that problem?
		- Write the FAQs to spot gaps in your thinking early.
		  collapsed:: true
			- "The FAQ can be many pages long for a complex project. The thinking is that by iterating on it with the senior leadership team, when they give the green light, everyone is operating from the same basis of understanding the risks. So when a project fails, they're not going to blame the team unless there are issues of execution."
			- **The PR/FAQ exposes the key assumptions and risks. We've all seen when a team has a good answer and a solid plan for how they're going to overcome a hurdle versus a team that is either dismissive or hasn't put much thought into it.** It's similar to how VCs look at pitches they're evaluating â€” they know the difference between those two things," he says. "And just like in venture capital, you don't ever really know whether it's going to work or not, but at least the senior leadership has a common understanding of what the problem is, how they're going to solve, and the real challenges."
	- Intentions Don't Work Mechanisms Do
	  collapsed:: true
		- "Most people are actually trying pretty darn hard, and they have good intentions. So **when we ran into an issue or a problem, Bezos would always ask, 'Do we have a mechanism in place so it doesn't happen again? Because if this high-performing or well-intentioned person tripped up, there's probably a process that we need to fix.'** This gets back to the idea that customer obsession can't just be a poster on the wall â€” it won't happen on its own."
		- Be crystal clear on what types of problems and issues you're trying to adjudicate. Very early on, when we were only selling books, publishers didn't want negative customer reviews. One called Bezos up and said, 'You do realize you're in the business of selling books. Why are you telling people not to buy a book?' After thinking about it, he said, we aren't really in the business of selling books â€” Amazon is in the business of allowing customers to make informed purchase decisions. And if in some cases that means you steer a customer away from making a purchase that they would later regret, that's beneficial for Amazon in the long haul."
	- Great Operators Dive Into the Detail
	  collapsed:: true
		- "There are some things that you can learn and teach. And then there are some things that you can't â€” you can't teach someone to be smarter. But you can teach someone how to be a better operator," says Bryar. "Once you learn what types of metrics you need to look at and see operational excellence in an action, then you can pattern match throughout your career."
		- Measure the Metrics that Matter
			- "Just think of a business as a process. It can be a complicated process, but essentially, it spits up outputs like revenue and profit, numbers of customers, and growth rates. **To be a good operator, you can't just focus on those output metrics â€” you need to identify the controllable input metrics.** A lot of people say that Amazon doesn't really care about profit or growth. I think that the data say otherwise, but what is true is that the main focus is on those input metrics," says Bryar.
			- "If you do the things you have control over right, it's going to yield the desired result in your output metrics. The best operators I've seen very clearly understand that if they push these buttons or turn these levers in the right way, they're going to get the results they want. They understand that process through and through."
			- He shares some sample input metrics that Amazon closely monitors. "For the retail business, what are the prices down to the product level, compared to what's out there on the market? How many new items were added? How many are in stock and ready to ship via Amazon Prime? What is the average delivery time? What was the number of orders? How many promises did we miss? What was the number of defects?" he says.
			- The bulk of these input metrics should describe how the customer used the product or service, Bryar notes. "It's like you're a sole proprietor in a coffee shop. You get to see how long the lines are. You get to see if people think the coffee's too hot. You have to recreate those metrics, especially as your business grows and there are more and more proxies between you and the customer."
		- Dive Into the Details
			- "What separates an average from a great operator is that the best ones really dive into these metrics in great detail and tear them apart. They're skeptical about whether that metric is really measuring what you mean it to measure. They're constantly devising new metrics based on their observations and problems or defects that occur," says Carr. "Those are actually the best times to dig into the metrics. Why didn't I have the right metrics upstream to detect that this customer problem would happen? And what new metrics do I need to develop to prevent this from happening again?'
			- It's not by luck that Amazon delights so many customers â€” there is an inordinate amount of operational rigor happening behind the scenes.
			- As some organizations grow, the leaders think, 'My job is just to focus on the big picture.' At Amazon, leaders are expected to know what's happening with their business at an incredible level of detail.
