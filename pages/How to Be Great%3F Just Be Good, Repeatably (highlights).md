- Writing
	- What is the summary of the article?
		- Steph Smith writes that greatness is a slow, incremental, and iterative process. We can't achieve greatness instantly. I find Steph interesting because she doesn't frame greatness as a competition, it is about you being consistent, dependable and disciplined. These qualities can only be expressed over time.
		- Even better,  she doesn't define greatness as a competition. Steph doesn't compare greatness with others around you, instead a deliberate attempt at becoming a better version of you. She recommends that we find that improved version of ourselves through consistent practice of inputs over time . The intentional inputs lead to expected outputs. We can also complete quick wins over time to compound to a greater output.
		- We can all be great if we outlast everyone else through our continuous practice of dependability and consistency at whatever input your achieving. You will simply be a great writer if you write consistently for years.
		- We also need to consider asking the right questions and thinking through our process of getting better. We can't simply rely on consistent practice over time. Greatness comes from an identified or researched process, that when followed, has a certain positive and compounding outcome. Simply moving faster and failing is not a strategy and can be harmful. Unless moving fast and failing to learn quickly is part of that process.
		- I also found that simply doing something (inputs) as often as possible, like practicing writing, makes you a better writer. We don't have to think about the quality of our writing. We only have to write often to improve.
	- What are ideas from the article that can be used for work?
		- I can block out a set time within the day for writing at least one hour and another hour for reading. This comes out to total of 2 hours of deliberate writing and practice.

	- Before stepping into the bulk of this article, I want to clarify two things:
	  
	  •   Greatness is not instantaneous
	  •   Greatness is earned
	  
	  The first step in becoming great is recognizing that you’re likely not already great. In fact, it comes from recognizing that there is no such thing as greatness at a specific instance in time. Greatness is instead a reflection of a period of effort, since greatness in a single instance can be reduced to luck.
	  
	  Moreover, being “great” is not about being better than someone else. It is about being dependable and disciplined, and ultimately it is earned. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpq1nq00zkd0b9xjwpm449d))
	- It’s Hard to be Consistent
	  
	  There’s a false impression that success or notoriety comes with being flashy. This notion comes from the media focusing on outliers, whether it be events or personalities which diverge from the norm. Not only can this encourage people to aim for notoriety just for the sake of it (think Elizabeth Holmes), but it makes the rest of us believe that correlation (of those outliers) is causation; in other words, success of those individuals is due to their offbeat ways. But here’s another storyline: the most sure and therefore the *best* way to “success” is through consistency.
	  
	  > *“Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.”* - James Clear, [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ)
	  
	  To be clear, consistency isn’t necessarily the easiest way to success, but one that can be achieved with a higher level of certainty, rather than hoping for a lottery win or someone to “discover” you. Continuous effort is a more thoughtful approach that leads to greatness when the following statements are true:
	  
	  1.  Inputs are consistent over time
	  2.  Intentional inputs lead to expected outputs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpq3j1edacf46vsqj5p5y2p))
	- Consistency

	  There is a famous saying from Napolean Hill which says, *“If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way”*. I would actually argue the quote should be, *“If you cannot do great things, do small things a great number of times”.*
	  
	  If you don’t have the opportunity to “do great things”, focus on consistently achieving small wins. These small things in fact do not need to be done in a great way, but a good way, repeatably. In fact, I would advise not to focus on perfection, as it is often the enemy of the successful ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpq4vep314j6ghj9am3sz97))
	- On your journey to greatness, you need to fall in love with the process which includes many local minima and maxima. Staying consistent and pushing through both of these continuously is what will truly differentiate you from those that are simply “good” and isolate you as one of the few that are “great’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpq7kbdd40emddgfq63k841))
	- You’re probably thinking… "So what? That’s just a classic example of compounding."
	  
	  Yes! That’s exactly the point. The best things in life often aren’t miracles, but well-thought out approaches that are sustainable. The same thing is true with businesses, marriages, and just about anything with repeatable elements. If you invest time into solving for what leads to success continuously, you will reap those benefits for years to come. *So even in the least quantifiable situations, reflect back on what could’ve made a previous loss a future win.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpqd11jnzg3a13512fq5vht))
	- Consider the best companies over time. None of them emerged overnight, nor was there a single inflection point that determined the success or notoriety of these companies. The line of separation between the “great” companies of all time and the “not so great”, is their ability to stand the test of time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpqfnkp2nqpsvm8kbtdgz01))
	- On top of consistency, greatness comes from asking the right questions and iterating to learn what inputs drive favourable outputs, and ideally **why**. “Greatness” comes from an identified or researched process that when followed, has some degree of certainty in the outcome.
	  
	  “Moving fast and breaking things” is not a strategy, unless you are clearly defining a process of learning so that in the future, you can “move fast and break less of the same things”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpqh21b538ph897htjws0a2))
	- A Habit of Progression
	  
	  > *“The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.”* - Albert Einstein
	  
	  Understand that in order to achieve the things you want in life, you’ll need to establish a **habit of progression**. You literally need to become good at being decent.
	  
	  There is one thing to clarify: this habit of progression must come with the right inputs. Being consistent with something leading you in the wrong direction, will *unsurprisingly* lead you in the wrong direction. So if this is the way you are constantly moving (excluding short periods of local minima), pivot until you determine what the right inputs are. I recently stumbled upon a concept of [zero acceleration, but non-zero velocity](https://web.archive.org/web/20200908160755/jdreyespaez.site/zero-acceleration/), which encapsulates this idea well.

	- You may ask, “what makes good, good?”. Ask yourself the question: “If I were to continue this every day for the next year, would I be in a better place?” If the answer is yes, you have a path towards “good”.
	  
	  Once you have found your inputs, then you’re in a good place to turn those inputs into the right habits through deliberate practice. Ie: you’ll be in a place to shift from good to great.
	  
	  This process of shifting between iteration and consistency is all part of developing a habit of progression. Once you make this habit your north star, you are no longer dependent on that “one big break” or that one company to “finally give you a chance”.
	  
	  And finally, if you’re reading this advice and think, “I’ve heard this before”, then ask yourself whether you’ve truly acted on this advice. When is the last time you truly iterated and tried new things? When is the last time you found something *good* and then truly stuck to it for years?

	- Two Steps Out
	  
	  While you’re moving towards “greatness”, keep in mind that it will likely happen slowly and that’s okay.
	  
	  When I think about the growth trajectory of my life and similarly, anyone that I’ve been close with, changes have always happened slowly. Whether it was a close family member falling into deep mental illness or friends building businesses to near-unicorn valuations, nothing ever happened overnight. Even more notably, no one would have ever expected those outcomes years prior. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpxf45nnce3xdn0mq59km8m))
	- Why is this important? Everyone wishes to elevate their life and in association, their happiness. For us to reach these top tiers, we cannot hope for this to *just happen*. We must expose ourselves to various inputs that may lead to better outputs, and train ourselves to recognize what’s working.
	  
	  And that’s exactly the point of continuous improvement. Since I believe that we can only ever see “two levels out”, we can’t discover these new inputs without slow, but repeatable change. We must explore 58 and then 59 and then all of a sudden, 61 will appear as this new array of opportunity we had never considered before ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpxg48v5dsv0tv5bw8rtty2))
	- As a more tangible example, when I started working in an office, I simply couldn’t fully visualize remote work. I knew it existed, but I couldn’t truly imagine this new way of living. And even once I started working remotely, it took years of iteration and pivoting to expand into the lifestyle that I now call my own. And of course, there’s probably many more tiers to explore that I simply haven’t visualized yet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpxgtj4ads32zjqkycj6wpq))
	- Try to remind yourself as you’re iterating, that there are new levels that you can’t even conceptualize right now. Regardless of how far along you are, know that these new levels of success will appear as you work towards the next one or two. And soon enough, you’ll be 10 levels ahead of what you could have ever imagined. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpy3p1gy7zz8hb9wzt6wkc2))
	- James Clear, from [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ), mentions a study in which students in Jerrey Uelsmann’s University of Florida photography class were divided into two groups. The first group would be the “quantity” group, while the second would be the “quality” group. The former would be judged solely on the number of photographs they submitted, while the latter would be graded on the excellence of a single image.
	  
	  The interesting outcome of the experiment was that the best photos were produced not by the quality group, but by the quantity group. Why? While the quality group spent their time speculating what perfection may have been, the quantity group took action in testing what was truly great.
	  
	  > *“It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action” - James Clear, [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ)*
	  
	  In other words, the “search” for greatness is often misguided, perhaps because what we imagine to be great, is in fact not that great at all. Instead of speculating what may make you great, get out there and start **doing**. Do not look for perfection or even greatness, but instead signs of “good” and start making tangible progress.
