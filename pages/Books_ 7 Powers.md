	- Introduction
		- Most of my time and that of everyone else at Netflix must be spent achieving superb execution. Fail at this, and you will surely stumble. Sadly, though, such execution alone will not ensure success. If you don’t get your strategy right, you are at risk. I have been around long enough that I remember the lesson of the IBM PC.
		- Our first public “culture deck,” released in August 2009, identified nine highly valued behaviors. The first was “Judgment.” As we elaborated: 
		  id:: 0d7d85b1-b738-44cf-a196-2e310530aaa5
			- You make wise decisions … despite ambiguity 
			  id:: cd6e352c-ebe3-49bf-9ec4-ca70d00e2f4d
			- You identify root causes and get beyond treating symptoms 
			  id:: c9ef876f-3705-4af2-b724-2423eef8b258
			- You smartly separate what must be done well now and what can be improved later
			  id:: e98358eb-70b3-4869-bbe8-3d750cc0f520
			- You think strategically and can articulate what you are and are not trying to do 
			  id:: c20b91ce-054f-4edc-85f3-9835202d0b5f
		- Strategy serves best not as an analytical redoubt, but rather in developing the “prepared mind” of those on the ground.
		- **To fulfill this role as a real-time strategy compass, a Strategy framework must be “simple but not simplistic.” If not simple, then concepts cannot be easily retained for day-to-day reference—usefulness is lost. If simplistic, then you risk missing something crucial. Easier said than done, though. For a subject as complex as Strategy, “simple but not simplistic” is a high hurdle.** ((758a824f-7b0d-4036-bcd6-78cbab612259))

			- ^^Strategy:^^ the study of the fundamental determinants of potential business value. The objective here is both positive—to reveal the foundations of business value—and normative—to guide business people in their own value-creation efforts.

		- ^^Power:^^ the set of conditions creating the potential for persistent differential returns
		  id:: 1af6f7f9-eab3-42f1-81b8-148433c213b2
		- I refer to this as The Mantra, since it provides an exhaustive characterization of the requirements of a strategy.
		- If we hold the ultimate normative benchmark in business to be value creation, then Game Theory alone is not sufficiently constrained to provide a normative framework for Strategy.
			- [Note]game theory does not take into account value creation.
		- For the purposes of this book, “value” refers to absolute fundamental shareholder value—the ongoing enterprise value shareholders attribute to the strategically separate business of an individual firm.

			- A mathematically equivalent7 but more felicitous formula for the NPV of free cash flow is: NPV = M0 g s m Where:                             M0 ≡  current market size                             g ≡  discounted market growth factor                             s ≡  long-term market share                             m ≡  long-term differential margin (net profit margin in excess of that needed to cover the cost of capital)
		- But deploying smart tactics, though complex and demanding, is not itself a strategy, and indeed any potential for Power remained opaque in those early days.
	- Chapter 1 Economies of Scale
		- Exclusive rights and originals made content, a major component of Netflix’s cost structure, a fixed-cost item. Any potential streamer would now have to ante up the same number of dollars, regardless of how many subscribers they had. If, say, Netflix paid $100M for House of Cards and their streaming business had 30M customers, then the cost per customer was three dollars and change. In this scenario, a competitor with only one million subscribers would have to ante up $100 per subscriber. This was a radical change in industry economics, and it put to rest the specter of a value-destroying commodity rat race.
		- The quality of declining unit costs with increased business size is referred to as Scale Economies. It is the first of the 7 Powers
		- Why do Scale Economies result in Power? Let’s recall the conditions for Power laid out in the Introduction. **Power is a configuration that creates the potential for persistent significant differential returns, even in the face of fully committed and competent competition.** To fulfill this, two components must be simultaneously present: 
		  id:: 0293cc0d-f67b-40e6-ada7-029e91ed1027
			- A Benefit: some condition which yields material improvement in the cash flow of the Power wielder via reduced cost, enhanced pricing and/or decreased investment requirements.
			- A Barrier: some obstacle which engenders in competitors an inability and/or unwillingness to engage in behaviors that might, over time, arbitrage out this benefit.
		- For Scale Economies, the Benefit is straightforward: lowered costs.
		- Beyond fixed costs, Scale Economies emerge from other sources as well. To name a few:
			- **Volume/area relationships**. These occur when production costs are closely tied to area, while their utility is tied to volume, resulting in lower per-volume costs with increasing scale. Bulk milk tanks and warehouses would serve as examples.
			- **Distribution network density**. As the density of a distribution network increases to accommodate more customers per area, delivery costs decline as more economical route structures can be accommodated. A new entrant competitor to UPS would face this difficulty.
			- **Learning economies**. If learning leads to a benefit (reduced cost or improved deliverables) and is positively correlated with production levels, then a scale advantage accrues to the leader. 
			  id:: 97cbc060-c409-48a2-a5d8-baa3930d8bdc
			- **Purchasing economies.** A larger scale buyer can often elicit better pricing for inputs. For example, this has helped WalMart.
		- Scale Economies: Summing Up Netflix’s streaming business is the driver of its remarkable rise to its double-digit billion market capitalization. ^^Getting there has required the relentless pursuit of excellence in every corner of the company. Such dedication and focus is essential for creating value, but it is not sufficient. In addition, Netflix’s success could only emerge once they had crafted a route to continuing Power in significant markets—in other words, a strategy.^^
		  id:: 992c2337-b0b1-4174-abeb-de39de6c61e5
			- The cornerstone of this strategy was moving to exclusives and originals which enabled them to wield their scale as a source of profound leverage. Such Scale Economies fully satisfy our definition of Power: the Benefit flowing from the reduction in content cost enabled by their vast pool of subscribers, and the Barrier resulting from the unattractive cost/benefit of market share onslaughts.

		- The success of all three parties on this dance card, Branch Out, Facebook and LinkedIn, was predicated on users’ value of the service depending on the presence of others, the central feature of Network Economies.
	- Chapter 2 Network Economies
		- Facebook and LinkedIn could co-exist because their respective networks were walled off from one another: users wanted to keep their personal lives (Facebook) separate from their work lives (LinkedIn). BranchOut hoped to build a bridge between the two, but it just didn’t fly. Users wanted this wall maintained, a lesson Facebook themselves learned in their failed rollout of Facebook at Work.
		- The Benefit and the Barrier Network Economies occur when the value of a product to a customer is increased by the use of the product by others. Returning to our Benefit/Barrier characterization of Power:
		- **Benefit.** A company in a leadership position with Network Economies can charge higher prices than its competitors, because of the higher value as a result of more users. For example, the value of LinkedIn’s HR Solutions Suite comes from the numbers of LinkedIn users, so LinkedIn can charge more than a competing product with fewer participants.
		  id:: 08194ec5-ff59-49b9-b069-bb72a0cef0a2
		- **Barrier.** The barrier for Network Economies is the unattractive cost/benefit of gaining share, and this can be extremely high. In particular the value deficit of a follower can be so large that the price discount needed to offset this is unthinkable. For example, “What would BranchOut have had to offer users for them to use BranchOut rather than LinkedIn?” I think most observers would agree that every user would have required a non-trivial payment, so the total spend for BranchOut would have been colossal.
		- Winner take all. Businesses with strong Network Economies are frequently characterized by a tipping point: once a single firm achieves a certain degree of leadership, then the other firms just throw in the towel. Game over—the P&L of a challenge would just be too ugly. For example, even a company as competent and with as deep pockets as Google could not unseat Facebook with Google+.
		- Boundedness. As powerful as this Barrier is, it is bounded by the character of the network, something well-demonstrated by the continued success of both Facebook and LinkedIn. Facebook has powerful Network Economies itself but these have to do with personal not professional interactions. The boundaries of the network effects determine the boundaries of the business.
		- Decisive early product. Due to tipping point dynamics, early relative scaling is critical in developing Power. Who scales the fastest is often determined by who gets the product most right early on. Facebook’s trumping of MySpace is a good example.
	- Chapter 3 Counter-Positioning
		- Definition: A newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent does not mimic due to anticipated damage to their existing business.
		  id:: cf46168d-9469-459c-aca1-ab1d08e48863
		- Creating something really new in business is challenging in the best of times. Bogle started Vanguard in 1975 but had the idea of index funds in 1950. Bogle's idea of passive investing was counter-position to the current market trends for actively investing money. 
		  id:: 89678a74-157d-431a-8759-692e9dfcfe2e
			- Naive onlookers of Bogle's Vanguard approach to passive arrived at the wrong conclusion or incorrect calculus to see it as a threat to managed funds. Often entrenched players are betting on their current methods that are successful and are unwilling to change and adapt.
		- Job security can negatively impact addressing a counter-position business model. A person's job security maybe more aligned to the current business model and suffer if a new approach was adopted.
		- At the heart of counter-positioning is the development of a new business model, over time, has the potential to supplant the old. 
		  id:: 42e11760-c97c-4b7a-8738-cccb227781b3
	- Chapter 4 Switching Costs
		- Switching costs arise when a consumer values compatibility across multiple purchases from a specific firm over time. These can include repeat purchases of the same product or purchases of complementary goods.
		- Switching Costs definition: The value loss expected by a customer that would be incurred from switching to an alternate supplier for additional purchases.
		- Benefit. A company that has embedded Switching Costs for its current customers can charge higher prices than competitors for equivalent products or services.40 This benefit only accrues to the Power holder in selling follow-on products to their current customers; they hold no Benefit with potential customers and there is no Benefit if there are no follow-on products.
		- Barrier. To offer an equivalent product, competitors must compensate customers for Switching Costs. The firm that has previously roped in the customer, then, can set or adjust prices in a way that puts their potential rival at a cost disadvantage, rendering such a challenge distinctly unattractive.
		- Financial. Financial Switching Costs include those which are transparently monetary from the outset.
		- Procedural. Procedural Switching Costs are somewhat murkier but no less persuasive. They stem from the loss of familiarity with the product or from the the risk and uncertainty associated with the adoption of a new product. When employees have invested time and effort to learn the particulars of how to use a certain product, there can be a significant cost to retraining them in a different system.
			- Furthermore, procedural changes open the door for errors. With databases, these are particularly costly, since they involve the totality of the customer’s information. Even when a competitor provides services and programs to help mitigate such difficulties of transition, these often prove costly and imperfect.
		- Relational. Relational Switching Costs are those tolls which would result from the breaking of emotional bonds built up through use of the product and through interactions with other users and service providers. Often a customer establishes close, beneficial relationships with the provider’s sales and service teams. Such familiarity, ease of communication and mutual positive feelings can create resistance to the prospect of severing those ties and switching to another vendor. Additionally, if the customer has developed affection for the product and their identity as a user, or if they enjoy the camaraderie which exists amongst a community of like users, they may shrink from the prospect of switching identities and abandoning that community.43
	- Chapter 5 Branding
		- Branding definition: The durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering that arises from historical information about the seller.
		  id:: eeb3e6b1-54b6-430f-8ce9-4f025ebf97ae
		- Benefit. A business with Branding is able to charge a higher price for its offering due to one or both of these two reasons: 
		  id:: a5ed909f-ad17-4a64-b4bc-299391fb9e41
			- Affective valence. The built-up associations with the brand elicit good feelings about the offering, distinct from the objective value of the good. 
			  id:: a0c260fd-f005-41b0-9eb4-174ec6224c1f
				- For example, Safeway’s cola may be indistinguishable from Coke’s in a blind taste test, but even after revealing the result, the taste tester remains willing to pay more for Coke.
				  id:: ec38eb38-8937-49b4-a80e-dfe42bfb9b64
			- Uncertainty reduction. A customer attains “peace of mind” knowing that the branded product will be as just as expected.
			  id:: 3db7d86e-e669-41c7-acad-9622f82ab79c
		- Barrier.** A strong brand can only be created over a lengthy period of reinforcing actions (hysteresis), which itself serves as the key Barrier.**
		  id:: c603e0e8-703b-4368-bbdd-05b6e5d8195a
		- Magnitude: the promise of eventually justifying a significant price premium. Business-to-business goods typically fail to exhibit meaningful affective valence price premia, since most purchasers are only concerned with objective deliverables. Consumer goods, in particular those associated with a sense of identity, tend to have the purchasing decision more driven by affective valence. Here’s the reason: in order to associate with an identity, there must be some way to signal the exclusion of alternative identities.
		- For Branding Power derived from uncertainty reduction, the customer’s higher willingness to pay is driven by high perceived costs of uncertainty relative to the cost of the good. Such products tend to be those associated with bad tail events: safety, medicine, food, transport, etc. Branded medicine formulations, for example, are identical to those of generics, yet garner a significantly higher price.
		- Brand Dilution: **Firms require focus and diligence to guide Branding over time and ensure that the reputation created remains consistent in the valences it generates. Hence, the biggest pitfall lies in diminishing the brand by releasing products which deviate from, or damage, the brand image.**
	- Chapter 6 Process Power
		- Process Power: Embedded company organization and activity sets which enable lower costs and/or superior product, and which can be matched only by an extended commitment.
		- Benefit. A company with Process Power is able to improve product attributes and/or lower costs as a result of process improvements embedded within the organization. For example, Toyota has maintained the quality increases and cost reductions of the TPS over a span of decades; these assets do not disappear as new workers are brought in and older workers retire.
		- Barrier. The Barrier in Process Power is hysteresis: these process advances are difficult to replicate, and can only be achieved over a long time period of sustained evolutionary advance. This inherent speed limit in achieving the Benefit results from two factors:
			- Complexity. Returning to our example: automobile production, combined with all the logistic chains which support it, entails enormous complexity. If process improvements touch many parts of these chains, as they did with Toyota, then achieving them quickly will prove challenging, if not impossible.
			- Opacity. The development of TPS should tip us off to the long time constant inevitably faced by would-be imitators. The system was fashioned from the bottom up, over decades of trial and error. The fundamental tenets were never formally codified, and much of the organizational knowledge remained tacit, rather than explicit. It would not be an exaggeration to say that even Toyota did not have a full, top-down understanding of what they had created—it took fully fifteen years, for instance, before they were able to transfer TPS to their suppliers. GM’s experience with NUMMI also implies the tacit character of this knowledge: even when Toyota wanted to illuminate their work processes, they could not entirely do so.
		- Professor Michael Porter of Harvard created quite a stir with his long-ago insistence that ^^operational excellence is not strategy^^. His reason for doing so, however, completely aligns with the “No Arbitrage” assumption of this book: ^^improvements that can be readily mimicked are not strategic, because they do not contribute to increasing m or s in the Fundamental Equation of Strategy, as these are long-term equilibrium values.^^ ((ab228c25-4e26-4f30-a6f4-e952ac5ab14c))
			- But wait a minute. Aren’t the step-by-step improvements that drive Process Power exactly what much operational excellence is all about? Yes, they are, but this represents only the Benefit side, which brings us to an important point of caution about Process Power. The type of Benefit it cites—evolutionary bottom-up improvement—stands at the heart of operational excellence; as such, it is quite common. The rarity of Process Power results from the infrequency of the Barrier: an unyielding, long-time constant for the improvements in question. No matter how much you invest or how hard you try, the desired improvements are constrained by a boundary of potential that is tied to time, as seen in the NUMMI experience of GM.
		- Perhaps the best way to think of it is this: Process Power equals operational excellence, plus hysteresis. Having said that, such hysteresis occurs so rarely that I am in strong agreement with Professor Porter’s sentiments. If one were to adopt a different definition of Strategy—something like “everything that is important”—then operational excellence would be strategic. As is, though, operational excellence—while important, hard to achieve and worthy of management mind share—is not sufficient to gain competitive advantage. Professor Porter would not dispute this.
		- In Economic History, there is a notion called the “colligation problem”: how far back should you go in understanding causation? The RBV perspective holds that if you stop at competitive advantage, you inappropriately truncate your investigation. Rather, you might gain deeper insight by considering what more fundamental prior dispositions (“resources”) enabled the development of competitive positions in the first place. The well-disseminated notion of Core Competencies76 is one expression of this view.
		- innovation was rarely driven by top-down purposive initiatives, but rather by the adaptive responses of “boundedly rational” agents. Such evolutionary innovation manifests, often tacitly, in new processes that they dubbed “routines.” This view maps well to what we saw with the TPS.

		- Chapter 8 - The Path to Power
			- **All power starts with invention, be it the invention of a product, process, business model or brand.**

					- **Resources**: You have to start with abilities you can bring to fruition. They may be personal, such as Steve Job's aesthetic sensibilities or as corporate as Google's vast stores of organized data
					- **External conditions** These resources then become valuable in the right evolving conditions: technological, competitive, legal, etc. For Netflix, advancing technology frontiers in optical communications and storage at the right time of internet evolution. If they transitioned too early before the technologies were ready, then they would have failed.
					- **Invention** For Netflix, inventions were their new product directions: streaming and originals and all the associated complements. Crafted, not designed.
					- **Power** came to be through economies of scale through lowered pricing of originals and exclusives.
				- **If we want power, our first step is through invention: breakthrough products, engaging brands, innovative business models. The second step is using the 7 powers to create value and power. And if we want to create value, then action and creativity must come foremost. **

			- Netflix made [[little bets]] on internet distribution of movies to test the water before fully committing their resources to compete and lead the industry
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2F5xxC4iyShJ.png?alt=media&token=6910c306-82bc-4c8b-ba90-0ca69f5d9a75)
				- The internet distribution was small at first (only 1,000 titles) and increased throughout the years as customers responded favorably
				  id:: e16e4a23-b7eb-45ac-a97e-b9279fb8a82d
			- Netflix outsourced IT technology to Amazon as it was not a core competency
			  id:: 5c63b1f8-afc9-4862-b19c-9252a80da30f
			- Netflix solved the transition from DVD to internet streaming through content deals. There were multiple approaches, first exclusive deals with content providers and also creating Netflix originals.
			  id:: 5b8631e7-1cbe-4394-af02-aa52043ef861
				- Netflix's originals are a fixed cost and played to Netflix's economies of scale as their subscribers grew.
				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2Fp5fERkWlLL.png?alt=media&token=ae2c99b5-3dea-4d01-9bfb-5402706d3080)
			- To assess which journeys are worth taking, you must first understand which destinations are desirable. Often dynamics and statics are conflated. Dynamics is "getting there" and statics "being there". A close study of Statics indicated that high relative market share led to attractive returns; this fed the instinct to gain market share (Dynamics), usually via aggressive pricing.
				- Such policies usually did not create value, as competitors would push back until the cost of share gains typically outweighed their benefits.
			- Compelling value
				- It is a characterization of products that are sufficiently superior in the eyes of the customer to fuel rapid adoption; they evoke a "gotta have" response.
				- There are three paths to creating compelling value:
					- **Capabilities led compelling value**: When a company tries to translate some capability into a product with compelling value
						- capabilities led compelling value is risky because customer need is unknown and should only be undertaken if an assured Barrier appears early on.
					- **Customer led compelling value**: Many players spy an unmet need, but no one knows how to satisfy it. The uncertainty in this case is "can you invent the solution" to meet the need.
					- **Competitor led compelling value**: A competitor has already brought to market a successful product, and the inventor must produce something so much better that it elicits the gotta have response.
			- Developing power must answer "what must I do" and "when do I do it"
		- Chapter 9 - The Power Progressions
			- Power results from the simultaneous presence of a benefit and a barrier.
			- Value is of benefit when not protected by a Barrier. Benefits can be easily copied. Barriers can scale of economies, network economies, or switching costs.
