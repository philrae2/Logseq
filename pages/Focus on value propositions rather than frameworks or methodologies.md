- **Note:**
	 - Applying methodologies and frameworks to problem-solving and decision-making may make us too reliant on the framework itself, rather than utilizing the methodologies as a thinking tool. We may fall into the trap of overconfidence that we clearly defined the problems and are taking the right steps to solving. Maybe not all frameworks are applicable to all situations.

	 - We need to to ensure problem solving is closer to the exploration of the problem and prevent abstraction of the environment through the employment of frameworks and methodologies.

	 - However, is there a difference between frameworks and systems to solve problems? Are systems closer to the problem itself and doesn't overcomplicate it? For example lean systems is a methodology or framework that isn't applicable to all processes.
