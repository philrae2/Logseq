	- What is change aversion?
	  
	  Change aversion is the negative short\-term reaction to changes in a product or service. It’s entirely natural, but it can be avoided — or at least mitigated. I’ll share what we’ve learned and offer some principles for minimizing the negative consequences of change aversion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp6qeyadjvvb7ee84gavwe2))
	- How to avoid (or mitigate) change aversion
	  
	  A savvy change\-management strategy can cut down on negative reactions, focus users on benefits, and make the change more successful. While we’re still learning with every launch, some principles are emerging to mitigate change aversion:
	  
	  **1. Warn users about major changes.** Unexpected changes catch people off\-guard and can provoke a defensive response. A simple message can set users’ expectations, for example: “Soon we’ll be introducing a redesigned site with new features to improve your experience. Stay tuned!”
	  
	  **2. Clearly communicate the nature and value of the changes.** An explicit description can help users to appreciate the changes from your perspective. For example: “We’ve redesigned our site. It’s now cleaner to save you time. Here’s how it’ll help you…”. With framing like that, users will be less prone to change aversion, such as: “Ugh, it looks totally different. I don’t know why they did this, and I wish they hadn’t messed with it.”
	  
	  **3. Let users toggle between old and new versions.** Giving users control over the timing of the change can cut down on feelings of helplessness. Allow them to play in the new sandbox before removing the old one.
	  
	  **4. Provide transition instructions and support.** If a city changes its street layout, residents need a map of the new streets and a way to direct lost people to their destinations. The same principle applies for your product’s alterations.
	  
	  **5. Offer users a dedicated feedback channel.** Without a way to connect with those responsible for the changes, users will vent publicly and further entrench their negativity. Users will respect you more if you actively solicit their opinions.
	  
	  **6. Tell users how you’re addressing key issues they’ve raised.** This completes the feedback loop and assures users that their feedback is critical to prioritizing improvements. Try a simple message like: “We’ve been listening to your feedback about the changes we’ve made. Based on your comments, here’s what we’re doing…” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp6tevm37gnb2d4vbqknqa6))
	- How Google understands change aversion
	  
	  At Google, we’re studying the nature of change aversion to better understand its dimensions and influences. With our growing knowledge, we’re trying to make our products’ changes less stressful for users and more successful overall.
	  
	  First, we aim to comprehensively test proposed changes and include time to modify them before launching to all users. This often includes usability studies, “dogfooding” with internal users, and partial launches (e.g. showing a new interface to 1% of users). Including a control group enables valid comparisons of appropriate metrics to inform decisionmaking. Kerry Rodden’s [post on UX metrics](http://www.designstaff.org/articles/how\-to\-choose\-the\-right\-ux\-metrics\-for\-your\-product\-2012\-03\-27.html) explains the types of behavioral and attitudinal data we analyze within the HEART framework.
	  
	  Second, when we launch changes, we track their impact on users to gauge the success of the launch and prioritize next steps. In addition to logs analysis and monitoring feedback channels, we use happiness tracking surveys to measure the effects of change on users’ satisfaction. By sampling a small percentage of users continuously, we can see attitudinal shifts that signal how much pain users are experiencing as they adjust to the changes we’ve launched.
