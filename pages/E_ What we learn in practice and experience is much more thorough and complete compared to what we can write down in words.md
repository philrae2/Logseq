	 - To [understand]([[understanding]]) a concept holistically it is better to practice and apply that concept or knowledge
		 - Through our application of knowledge we can evaluate our understanding and gain feedback on the missing gaps of our understanding

		 - In our practice and applied experience employ the concept of [[sprints]] to shorten the [[feedback loop]] to maximize learning

		 - Teaching is another form of application that can strengthen and test our understanding 

		 - The application of our knowledge allows us to build a lattice for which we can hang our knowledge on to make connections and relationships with already existing information
