- Contrary to social-science wisdom, almost no discovery, no technologies of note, came from design and planning--they were Black Swans. (refer to [[Books: Where Good Ideas Come From]] to provide some granularity)
	 - The strategy for the discoverers and entrepreneurs is to rely on top-down planning and focus on maximum tinkering and recognizing opportunities when they present themselves. 

	 - Don't learn to be precise (i.e., learning what we already know), learn what we don't know

	 - Create a process that tries to create a spotlight on the possible unknowns along with what we know

- The human minds suffers from three ailments as it comes into contact with history: 
	 - 1. the illusion of understanding, or how everyone thinks he knows what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize

	 - 2. the retrospective distortion, or how we can assess matters only after the fact, history seems clearer and more organized in history books than in empirical reality
		 - our minds are generally incapable of accepting the idea, our minds are is capable of making sense out of almost anything and providing explanations for all phenomena

	 - the overvaluation of factual information and the handicap of authoritative and learned people, particularly when they create categories

- the studious examination of the past in the greatest detail does not teach you much about the mind of History; it only gives you the illusion of understanding it

- categorizing is necessary for humans, but it becomes pathological when the category is seen as definitive preventing people from considering the fuzziness of boundaries let alone revising their categories

- Any reduction of information sources or simplification of an event can have explosive consequences since it rules out some sources of uncertainty; it drives us to a misunderstanding of the fabric of the world. 

- Some scientific results may be useless in real life because they underestimate the impact of the highly improbable (or lead us to ignore it) but that many of them may be actually creating black swans.

- ^^Black swans are more prone to occur in environments where [[inequality]] is possible. In this environment, [[uncertainties]] are more prominent. ^^
	 - ^^[[Scalability]] points towards greater uncertainties and inequality^^

- The [[problem of induction]] is how do we know what we know? How do we know that what we observed from given objects and events suffices to enable us to figure out their other properties? There are traps built into any kind of knowledge gained from observation.

- [[falsifiable]], [[conjecture]]s, and [[refutation]]s - you formulate a (bold) conjecture and you start looking for the observation that would prove you wrong. This is the alternative to our search for [[disconfirmation]] instances.
	 - When a rule is an unknown try to find instances where the rule is wrong rather than trying to confirm it. When making a decision, disconfirm your assumptions rather than trying to prove it correct 

- We like stories, we like to [[summarize]], and we like to [[simplify]], i.e., to reduce the dimension of matters [[narrative fallacy]]. It is associated with our vulnerability to overinterpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. It severely distorts our mental representation of the world; it is particularly acute when it comes to the rare event. 
	 - The narrative fallacy addresses our limited ability to look at sequences of facts without weaving an explanation into them, or equivalently, forcing a logical link, an arrow of relationship, upon them. They make them all the more easily remembered; they help them make more sense. 
		 - ^^Narrative fallacy can go wrong is that it increases our impression of [[understanding]]^^

		 - Narrativity can affect the remembrance of past events. We will tend to more easily remember those facts from our past that fits a narrative; while we tend to neglect others that do not appear to play a causal role in that narrative. #[[recency bias]]

		 - narrativity may introduce [[causality]] that isn't actually there

	 - The way to avoid the ills of the narrative fallacy is to favor [[experimentation]] over [[storytelling]], experience over history, and clinical knowledge over theories.

- Absence of nonsense may not be sufficient to make something true. 

- Where the relevant is sensational
	 - Our intuitions are not suited for nonlinearities. Our [[emotional]] apparatus is designed for [[linear causality]]. For instance, if you study every day, you expect to learn something in proportion to your studies. If you feel that you are not going anywhere, your [[emotion]]s will cause you to become demoralized. 

	 - **Process over results**
		 - We favor the sensational and the extremely [[visible]]. This affects the way we [[judge]] heroes. There is little room in our consciousness for heroes who do not deliver visible [[results]]--or those heroes who focus on [[process]] rather than results.

	 - Our minds are accustomed to receive rewards in a steady stream. We would rather have 100k every year for a year than 1million one year and no other money in the next or preceding 10 years.

	 - If you engage in Black Swan-dependent activity, it is better to be part of a group.

- Humans will believe anything you say provided you do not exhibit the smallest shadow of diffidence; like animals, they can detect the smallest crack in your confidence before you express it. The trick is to be as smooth as possible in personal manners. It is much easier to signal self-confidence if you are exceedingly polite control people without having to offend their s and friendly; you control people without having to offend their sensitivity. 
	 - The problem with business people, Nero realized, is that if you act like a loser they will treat you as a loser--you set the yardstick yourself. There is no absolute measure of good or bad. It is not what you are telling people, it is how you are saying it. 

- Chapter 8 - The problem of silent evidence
	 - ^^A fallacy in the way we understand events is that of silent evidence. History hides both [[Black Swan]]s and its Black Swan-generating ability from us.^^

	 - To understand and analyze [[success]] we need to analyze the qualities in [[failures]]
		 - See the ((f16f5cbe-cb4e-4229-8f42-d4ddfb8fa395)) and ((4d5eaf51-22cc-43c2-8cbe-48059db70ba0))

	 - ^^[[Silent evidence]] provides the illusion of stability.^^ The bias lowers our perception of the [[risk]]s we incurred in the past, particularly for those of us who were lucky to have survived them. Our life came under a serious threat but, having survived it, we retrospectively underestimate how risky the situation actually was.

	 - the [[reference point]] argument: do not compute odds from the vantage point of the winning gambler, but from all those who started in the cohort. 

	 - When survival is in play, don't immediately look for causes and effects. The reason may simply be attributed to [[luck]].

	 - Be sparing and aware of the word "[[because]]", try to limit it to situations where "because" is derived from experiments, not backwards-looking history. 

- Chapter 9 
	 - [[ludic fallacy]] - Latin for games, the assumption that we can apply sterilized concepts and constructs of chances and apply them to the real world
		 - in real life we do not know the [[odd]]s, we need to discover them and the sources of [[uncertainty]] are not defined.
			 - Sometimes we create models to calculate certainty and scope uncertainty in our environment, but [[Black Swan]]s can appear outside our scope

		 - Probability is to be a skeptic, not  a tool for  people with calculators to satisfy their to produce with fancy calculations and certainties.

		 - The problem with [[Silent evidence]] and [[Black Swan]]s is that we don't learn from them and don't see them; we worry about those that happened, not those that may happen but did not. It is why we fall for the problem of induction, we we confirm. 
			 - ^^We love certainty, confirmation, the visible and the known. Randomness and uncertainty are abstractions. We respect what has happened, and ignore what could have happened. We naturally  are shallow and superficial---and we do not know it. ^^

- **Additional knowledge of the minutiae of daily business can be useless, even actually toxic**
	 - The more (unneeded) information you give someone, the more hypotheses they will formulate along the way, and the worse off they will be. This extra information is random noise and but they mistake it for information. 

	 - Our ideas are sticky: once we produce a theory, we are not likely to change our mindsâ€”so those who delay developing theories are better off. This is a good reason to cultivate active open mindedness
		 - When we develop our opinions on weak evidence we are going to have difficulty interpreting new information that contradicts our early opinions #[[confirmation bias]]

	 - **The expert problem**
		 - Things that "move" like the field of economics and therefore require knowledge, do not usually have experts, while things that don't move seem to have some experts, like medicine. 
			 - Fields and professions that deal with the future and base their studies on the nonrepeatable past have an expert problem. Things that move often have black swan problems. 

			 - The problem with experts is that they do not know what they do not know. Lack of knowledge and delusion about the quality of our knowledge come togetherâ€”the same process that makes us know less also makes us satisfied with our knowledge.

		 - We, humans, are the victims of [[asymmetry]] in the perception of random events. We attribute our successes to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control, namely to randomness. ((7441ba92-f9b2-4d11-9934-85e59358ac22)) We feel responsible for the good stuff, but not for the bad and this leads us to think we are better than others whatever we do for a living. 

	 - Plans fail due to lack of account or neglect of sources for uncertainty outside the plan itself.
		 - The less routine the task, the more prone we are to estimate incorrectly or veer off from the resulting outcome. If there are no incentives to estimate more correctly, we can under-estimate for our own benefits.

	 - **Estimating fallacies**
		 - __variability__ taking a projection too seriously without heeding its accuracy. The accuracy of your forecast matters far more than the forecast itself. 

		 - __degradation__ your forecast will degrade the longer the timespan. Place less trust in long time lines.

		 - __randomness of the variable forecasted__  Even if we agree with a given forecast, we have to worry the real possibility of significant divergence

- Chapter 11
	 - The best way to get lucky and find solutions to collect opportunities. Our discoveries are serendipitous, not an intention or an active pursuit to discover a specific problem or goal.

	 - The laser was discovered with the intent to split light, but now created so many uses such as retina surgery, data storage, or CDs.

	 - Not all sciences are equal, therefore don't transfer trust from one to another. For example physics or mathematics should be trusted more easily than medicine.

	 - Trying to predict social sciences or the economy with fancy mathematics is wasted intelligence as it relies on rational people.

	 - **Be confident about what is wrong, not what you believe is right.**

	 - Our future happiness is a self-deception. You're new job or new raise will fade.

	 - Randomness can also be viewed as incomplete information. 

- 13. Advice
	 - We shouldn't try to strip away our judgments. We naturally judge things. We don't see a tree, we see a plain or normal tree. A beautiful tree or an ugly tree. We can teach ourselves to behave appropriately despite our judgements and prejudices. 

	 - Learn how to rank beliefs not according to their possibility but by the harm they may cause. 

	 - **be prepared**
		 - Shed the idea of full predictability. Knowing that you cannot predict does not mean we can't benefit from unpredictability. We can prepare instead. Believing in predictions is harmful as it gives us a soothing, calming, and therapeutic effect. Be prepared for all eventualities. 

		 - invest in preparedness not in prediction

	 - **do not be narrow-minded**
		 - Chance favors the prepared. Don't look for something in particular but work hard to get let contingency enter your working life. (contingency: a future event or circumstance which is possible but cannot be predicted with certainty)

	 - [[opportunity]] seize any opportunity or anything that looks like an opportunity. They are rarer than we think. Positive Black Swans are a necessary first step: we need to be exposed to them. __Attend parties__
		 - Put yourself in asymmetric situations where favorable consequences are much larger than the unfavorable ones

- 14. [[bell curve]] [[Gaussian]]
	 - the Gaussian bell curve sucks randomness out of life as it treats outliers as ancillaries. The jump to the extreme becomes more exponential. It gives us a sense of certainty. 
		 - Standard deviations do not matter outside Gaussian curves or in environments where extreme events are given little consequence or thought.

		 - We need to realize that the greater sample size that we have a bell curve will start to hide the extremes.

	 - Bell curves are not ubiquitous in real life, therefore applying them to real world situations is faulty. Because asymmetry occurs in real life, bell curves must be carefully and appropriately used. 

- 15.
	 - Those who derive consequences and seize the importance of the ideas, seeing their real value, they win the day. They are the ones who can talk about the subject. 

	 - [[fractal]] - a word to describe the geometry of the rough and broken. Fractality is the repetition of geometric patterns at different scales, revealing smaller and smaller versions of themselves. Small parts resemble, to some degree the whole.

- Be careful to analyze the roots of topics under probability. If the underlying basis is defining random as coin tosses then it is not reflective of reality. Subatomic particles converge to Gaussian, real life does not.

- Define our success and goals. We have more control of our lives if we decide on the criterion ourselves. 

- Don't sweat the small stuff, be grateful of the bigger picture.
