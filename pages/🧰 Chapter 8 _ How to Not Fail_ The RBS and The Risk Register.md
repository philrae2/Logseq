	 - The systematic way of preventing failure is **Project Risk Management**. Project risk management is essentially:
		 - Identifying risks

		 - Allotting attention and effort in proportion to the importance of each risk

	 - Our tool for identifying risks is the **Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)**.

	 - Our tool for responding to risks is the **Risk Register**.

- RBS
	 - TheÂ **Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)** is a list of risks grouped under categories. It is like the WBS, but instead of work, the RBS contains risks.
		 - Here's an example of an RBS from a volunteer outreach I used to organize for university students:
			 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamfu%2FdZIJRF1po7.png?alt=media&token=a7e6e6ba-5145-4e16-b4ca-4fd6ee55d38c)

		 - You can create your RBS the same way you created your WBS. You can start one with your own experience and notes. Now that you have a [WBS](((de4955b2-951b-476c-8b82-f69034814483))) and a [Communications Plan](((2b8794de-be82-45cd-bb83-b43b0e8fbf6a))) for your project, you can go through them and ask yourself, "what could go wrong in each of these blocks?"
			 - [[Tip for Roam beginners]]
				 - Press shift and click on the block references below. These will be opened in the right sidebar, which helps you create RBS blocks based on blocks from your WBS and Communications Plan.
					 - ((de4955b2-951b-476c-8b82-f69034814483))

					 - ((2b8794de-be82-45cd-bb83-b43b0e8fbf6a))

				 - Future-proof the contexts of your risks by block-referencing their sources. They could be block references or aliased with an asterisk. Example [below](((72e87aac-5b22-4fda-980c-40e36ece84b9))).
					 - In MacOS, press the option key while dragging the bullet of the source block to your RBS. 
						 - This is sometimes faster than typing.

					 - In Windows, press the alt key instead.

			 - Here's an example of an RBS in Roam: [Project RESOLVED Crowdfunding RBS]([[[[P: RESOLVED Crowdfunding]] RBS]]). I created this by alt/option-dragging blocks from my notes positioned in the sidebar.

	 - Similar to the WBS, you can benefit from other people's knowledge by doing the following:

			 - [[pro tip]]:
				 - Show them your WBS and Communications Plan and ask them what risks they see.
id:: fb8c46f8-2248-4c65-9502-ebe7c0963693

				 - Ask them what the biggest risks in their project were.

				 - Ask what risks surprised them.

				 - __For RBS workshops with project teams, I prepare by listing down risk categories. I label a Manila paper for each of these categories. These posters are on walls. I ask my teammates to go around the room and write down risks under each category.__
					 - __Try googling "<project type> risk categories". Eg, "construction project risk categories"__

					 - __This also helps: ((fb8c46f8-2248-4c65-9502-ebe7c0963693))__

- Risk Register
	 - The **Risk Register** is a list of risks from your RBS, scored in terms of probability and impact, with mitigation and contingency plans.
		 - How do we program our attention in proportion to the importance of each risk? We can use the Risk Register to do this.

	 - Risk Scoring
		 - Now that you have your initial list of risks, you can now find out where to focus your time and attention on through risk scoring.
			 - The magnitude of a risk has two factors:
				 - Probability: the likelihood of the risk actually becoming real

				 - Impact: the negative consequences of the risk

			 - Risk score = probability score * impact score
				 - The rubric and the granularity are up to you. This is what I normally use:
					 - Probability:
						 - #p1 unlikely to happen

						 - #p2 between #p1 and #p3

						 - #p3 will almost certainly happen

					 - Impact:
						 - #i1 does not significantly affect the quality of the project

						 - #i2 significantly lowers the quality of the project but does not result in failure

						 - #i3 show-stopper

					 - In Roam, the Risk Register could be made with queries. In Roam, you need to manually compute the product of Impact and Probability to get the Risk Score (though [there is a workaround](((4329c6d1-a428-4248-a37c-aaf4d42ffcea)))). The Risk Register is commonly made using a spreadsheet. The calculation is automated and it is easier to use for people who don't use Roam. [Here's an example.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WXE_4X900XucT7viRG_VDD-ts94LrniqxrUcxlVDblc/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=105204288025144879311)

		 - [[Maximize your learning]]
			 - Score your risks by tagging them with probability and impact scores. Then manually compute the product of the two and include it as another tag. For the ready-made queries below to work, use the tags above for impact and probability, and the following for the product, the risk scores: #s1 #s2 #s3 #s4 #s6 #s9

				 - Here's an example branch from the [Project RESOLVED Crowdfunding RBS]([[[[P: RESOLVED Crowdfunding]] RBS]])
					 - {{embed  ((ee7951bb-4595-4989-b2b4-3216b8892c6d))}}

				 - [[Note to advanced Roam users]]: You can actually just create queries based on combinations of probability and impact, instead of manually computing the risk score. Eg, for #s3 risks:
id:: 4329c6d1-a428-4248-a37c-aaf4d42ffcea
					 - {{[[query]]: {and: [[[[P: RESOLVED Crowdfunding]] RBS]] {or: {and: [[p1]] [[i3]]} {and: [[p3]] [[i1]]}}}}}

					 - [[Tip for Roam beginners]] If you are unfamiliar with queries in Roam and would like to learn it, [here's a primer (roamstack.com)](https://roamstack.com/roam-queries-primer/).

	 - Programming your attention
		 - If you used the risk score tags suggested above, the queries[*](((78b3c264-6bd4-410c-aa73-cc6111f16b81))) below should work:
			 - {{embed  ((b6fff010-af08-43b5-a9e7-8c00bed70cd9))}}

		 - We want to proportionately allot attention to our risks in terms of their score in two aspects of project risk management:
			 - Risk Response Planning
id:: b855492c-0117-409e-b051-6019a5174024

			 - Risk Monitoring
id:: 97f7ccb8-35cc-41bc-a402-72b57f4c6a29

		 - For risk response planning, we prioritize higher scoring risks. Risk response implementation entails additional work and may incur costs, so we should allot our attention to risks that are most likely and have the biggest possible impact on the project. We can choose to disregard lower-scoring risks.

		 - For risk monitoring, we review higher-scoring risks more often than the lower-scoring ones.

	 - ((b855492c-0117-409e-b051-6019a5174024))
		 - Risk response planning answers two things for each risk (which you choose not to disregard):
			 - Mitigation: how do we lower the probability and/or the impact of the risk?

			 - Contingency: if the risk becomes real, what do we do?

		 - [[Maximize your learning]]
			 - Plan mitigation and contingencies for your highest scoring risks and show-stoppers.
				 - You can do this in Roam in several ways:
					 - You can create a page for risk responses, block reference your risks in the page, then indent your mitigation and contingency plans under those block references.

					 - You can indent your mitigation and contingency plans right under the risks reported by the queries. Here's an example (you might need to expand the blocks if they are collapsed):
						 - {{embed  ((60244b33-51c3-4929-8097-9ba024cdc006))}}

					 - Let's do the same for some your project risks:
						 - {{embed  ((508bf291-a700-4f57-9087-e2e4b2d26c3a))}}

						 - {{embed  ((5467955b-0ad6-4b7a-b496-72a1532c1172))}}

						 - {{embed  ((70c554ff-3250-4ece-a733-fa475d0e0faa))}}

						 - (This is an exercise. I arbitrarily chose which risks scores to include here. For your actual projects, you decide which project risk scores indicate that risks are safe to neglect.)

			 - Now that you have your risk response plans, it is time to choose which ones you want to add to your WBS and your Communications Plan. Some risk responses may require too much work or may cost too much to make sense. This may mean accepting the risk, changing the scope of the project, or dropping the project.
				 - Here's an example of a mitigation plan that I decided to add to my WBS (click the reference count of the mitigation plan):
					 - {{embed  ((f42eae08-4cf2-4743-a17a-b8dcffc96fec))}}

				 - This step demonstrates a key point on project planning using these tools: their outputs can be inputs to other tools. You choose which ones to add to your WBS and which ones you consciously neglect.

	 - ((97f7ccb8-35cc-41bc-a402-72b57f4c6a29))
		 - Your project environment is always changing. What you know about your project and its context is also constantly changing. You'd want to update your Risk Register considering these changes, but at the same time, you don't want to be weighed down carrying all those risks in your head. You'd want to assign the review of risks to your future selves. In risk monitoring, programming your attention means reviewing higher-scoring risks more often than lower-scoring ones. We will do this in in the ((ca0d3c1c-e5e5-420a-b85d-77021e022757)) section of [[ðŸ§° Chapter 11 | People Will Make or Break Your Project: Leading a Team]]:

	 - Project risk management is a systematic way to minimize potential downsides in the project. How about the inverse? How do we systematically maximize the upside of the project? How do we systematically get lucky? We'll learn this in the next chapter: [[ðŸ§° Chapter 9 | Designing Serendipity: How to Systematically Get Lucky]].
