- **Note:**
	 - We think we have more control of the situation if we worry about the problem incessantly. We treat worrying as almost a solution to a problem or to prevent problems from happening. We should assess the level of need to worry and plan instead.

	 - We may worry about the wrong things and waste our time and energy on something we shouldn't focus on.

	 - Worrying can be detrimental to our focus and attention
