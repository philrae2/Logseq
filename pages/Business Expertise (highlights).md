	- broadly speaking, NDM researchers specialise in studying (and in many cases *extracting*) tacit mental models of expertise in real world environments. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2samrvt88f2jbyt0g0b3ve1))
	- At the core of DiBello’s work lies two things:
	  
	  1.  A ‘triad’ mental model of business that consists of three components. This triad makes up a large chunk of business expertise — different industry verticals might have different instantiations of the triad, but the core structure of this mental model is present in every business.
	  2.  A mental attribute DiBello calls ‘cognitive agility’, which is the ability to update one’s mental models quickly when presented with disconfirming evidence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2sannec0f55v763dfv3qgnx))
	- DiBello [writes](https://commoncog.com/tacit-mental-model-of-business/#the-mental-model-of-business) that experts in business are people who have achieved a deep understanding of the following core areas of their business: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2sb5bgkf9jrgfhgdz9hp10v))

		- **Factors involved in effective operations (which DiBello calls ‘Supply’)** — this is the most obvious of the three legs in the triad; good businesspeople have a firm grasp of the operational nature of their firm. (Or, if they do not themselves have such a firm grasp, they have someone in their executive team who does). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2sb5egqkrbmyes3yj2njxac))
			- **Note**: For nonprofits, government, and consulting the concept of supply needs translation. Supply would be the business operations and success means a deep understanding of it.
		- **Factors influencing the market (which DiBello calls ‘Demand’)** — this is the second most obvious of the three legs in the triad; good businesspeople have an intuitive sense of their market, understand their competitive position within it versus other competitors, and grok the factors that influence new entrants or competitive threats. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2sb81s8jtjp2tpn1hxcfs3b))
			- **Note**: The market knowledge translated for FDA is understanding the work of the reviewers and others who take part of the review process end to end. This review process would include all the roles and different workflows that support the review including user fees, site reviews, and regulatory affairs.
		- **Factors driving business finance and economic climates (which DiBello calls ‘Capital’)** — this is the least obvious of the three legs. Talk to a novice observer and they would tell you that businesspeople are good at running their own businesses (Supply) and are good at reading their competitive environment (Demand). But it is less obvious that a deep understanding of capital is also part of business expertise. DiBello argues that expert businesspeople understand the capital cycle in their industries, know how to raise money to fuel expansion, and have a deep, felt sense of cash flow, unit economics, and risk when using debt or when funding corporate activities such as mergers & acquisitions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2sbb158b8t9861v4fbz4rhd))
			- **Note**: The FDA lacks  a good understanding of capital—the know how to operate efficiently and effectively to generate significant value compared to others.
	- Given this interrelationship between the three factors, you may visualise business expertise as a triad:

	- DiBello further writes that “experts in the same domain *easily identify each other*. Even if they don’t agree with another expert’s choices, they easily recognise that they share a common *perceptual experience within their area of expertise (emphasis added)*.” This is a fancier way of saying that if a yoghurt magnate meets a mining tsar, the yoghurt businessperson might not understand the mining business, but would recognise the latter’s expertise through the facility with which they are able to reason about the Supply, Demand, and Capital aspects of their business. And the yoghurt magnate would be able to do so *because they have the same intuitive sense of the yoghurt business in their heads*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2sbfned8gx5dtw50yhn3wp4))
		- If experts can easily identify each other, that would entail first principles of expertise are identifiable across different markets and environments.
	- Conversely, expert businesspeople are able to tell when individuals are not that great at business — even if they aren’t able to articulate how exactly they know so. This, too, falls out of their perceptual experience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2sbfyve3p9h8c72hkgraytz))
	- Cognitive Agility
	  
	  **It is not enough to have a firm grasp of all three aspects of business. DiBello notes that to do well in business over the long term, you need the ability to update your mental models when presented with disconfirming evidence.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2sbg9ft48cn4e2r69kp01wx))
	- When reading about businessmen biographies, ask yourself: what aspects of Supply, Demand and Capital are present in this particular business? And what aspects of the entrepreneur’s expertise may be decomposed into the triad? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2scxmtdsa5nhy04dsv95xnf))
	- **The second use for the triad is obvious: you may look at your own experiences in business and ask:
	  
	  •   How good are you at all three aspects of your business? And:
	  •   How good are you at predicting how changes in one leg of the triad affect the other two legs?** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2scy1asem7jcnsc4vka6d7k))
	- **Note that execution in business is usually a team affair. DiBello notes that business expertise may be regarded as a form of ‘distributed cognition’ — which is a more complicated way of saying that it is ok if you aren’t good at *all* three legs of the triad, so long as other members of your team shore up your deficiencies. If the triad is covered adequately by an entire team, you’re good to go.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2scyhbgt48ba73p49r6869p))
