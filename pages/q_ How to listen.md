title: q: How to listen
---

- > Listening is more of a mindset than a checklist of dos and don’ts. It’s a very particular skill that develops over time by interacting with all kinds of people—without agenda or having aides there to jump in if the conversation goes anywhere unexpected or untoward.

- Benefits of Listening
	 - People who feel listened become less defensive and oppositional and more willing to listen to other points of view. They also are more able to evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings. 

	 - Good listeners are able to draw out more information, relevant details, and elaboration from speakers without asking questions. So listen with interest to have more interesting conversations.

- What do people want when we're listening?
	 - Ask if they feel they've been understood and heard?
		 - "What can we do to make you feel understood and listened to?"

	 - Listening is the act of giving. Everyone craves the feeling of being listened to, to be understood, and more importantly to be valued. ^^To listen well is to figure out what's on someone's mind and to communicate through your act of listening that you care enough to want to know.^^ Listening is showing the other person that we're interested in them and what they have to share. Don't fake interest, people will eventually pick up you're not authentic. If we find people uninteresting, we aren't asking interesting questions.

- What is good listening?
	 - If you interrupt people or tend to finish other people's sentences for them, even if you're trying to help, you may be bad at listening. The first step to improving is to accept the diagnosis. Some symptoms of a bad listener are listening while preoccupied, fidgeting, or looking at your phone. We do these things because we're thinking about something else and our preoccupation leaks out into our conversations. This makes our listeners feel ignored or misunderstood. We can use TAPs to create automatic behaviors that promote better listening habits. ((f40a2bfb-0bea-4f95-808e-0d93076c981b))

	 - However good listening is more than a set of automatic outward behaviors, it includes having the right mindset that is developed with time through interactions with many different kinds of people. While learning how to be a better listener takes time and effort, listening not only helps you understand those who speak to you but also yourself. We may be predisposed to bad listening because of our childhood experiences and the resulting personalities we developed. For adults who had caregivers who were threatening or abusive, listening can be difficult because intimacy can feel scary or frightening.

		 - **10 Skills for empathic listening**
			 - Attending or acknowledging during listening means providing verbal or nonverbal feedback to the speaker such as eye contact
id:: c8a74e3e-3523-4306-b508-c8dc03fdbb84

			 - Restating or paraphrasing is responding and acknowledging the person's basic message by inviting their confirmation
id:: 05fb5d07-3be6-4e65-972f-b1f929eee4c1

			 - Reflecting feelings and experiences engage with the person through heard or perceived cues during the conversation (this could be dangerous as it interjects yourself especially if the speaker is revealing something emotionally vulnerable) 
id:: 4229f61e-8191-4954-a164-f663d641107a

			 - Interpreting - similar to reflecting, we are engaging with the person's content they are conveying but also interjecting ourselves 
id:: fdc38659-ab84-45ea-b873-eae06fb75519

			 - Summarizing or synthesizing: focusing the emotions/information shared and inviting correction or feedback
id:: cfda47e0-e383-4915-82d2-c3cb1a19af00

			 - Probing: engaging with the person through supportive questions that validate and acknowledges what emotions they're sharing
id:: 084ccab1-1cf7-4ebb-9653-ea023b10fa31

			 - Giving feedback: also engaging with the person, though this might not be welcomed as we are injecting ourselves, unless the feedback is fully non critical and is focused 100% on the speaker
id:: 834aae15-b60c-4a83-9b78-2c5a88a1bf58

			 - Supporting - showing warmth and caring that is in alignment with the speaker's expression of support
id:: d7a162a0-6935-4a69-9f6e-ca00da20da42

			 - Checking perceptions: Making sure that our understanding of what emotions are being shared are correct. I think this might be better than summarizing as it allows the speaker to speak and summarize for us?
id:: 78af4481-685c-4f24-8731-2a203271f136

			 - Being quiet: gives focus to the speaker 100% if all they want is the time to talk and to be listened, and heard

- Tools for Good Listening
	 - A way to cultivate interest is to be curious. When we're having conversations, end the conversation by learning something new. When we're thinking we already know what that person has to say, then we're killing our curiosity. We don't listen because we think we already know; we stereotype. We're wasting our time. If people are boring or unfeeling to us, that means we don't know enough about them. Of course, only remain curious if knowing that person aligns with our goals, though that is almost an impossible task to predict at the start.

- What is bad listening?
	 - If we want to give the speaker a sense of being understood and listened to, we need to also give them our attention. Don't take pieces of the conversation away from the speaker by interjecting comments about yourself (when they are clearly wanting the spotlight). When we interject and control the narrative we are robbing ourselves of the opportunity to learn something new from the conversation. Instead of interjection, approach the conversation with the goal of collaborating with mutual understanding. We should strive for the conversation spotlight pointed towards the speakers; be willing to respond, appreciate and expand on every contribution. Try to find what excites them. 

	 - If a speaker shares their troubles with you, it does not necessarily mean they are seeking a solution for it. People don't usually want a solution from us anyway, they just want a sounding board. People will resent unwanted advice, even if it is well intentioned and sound. We don't need to fix people's problems.

	 - Don't interrogate the other person with "What do you do for a living?" or "What part of town do you live in?". Avoid questions that makes others feel like you're sizing them up. Instead, listen for understanding. When we take comfort in our shared beliefs and accept and acknowledge our differences we gain understanding. We can also communicate our understanding not by nodding or parroting, or paraphrasing but through our active engagement of the conversation, give descriptive and evaluative information. We are succeeding at listening when we help the speaker figure out why they're sharing information with us, sometimes they don't know themselves.

- Barriers to Listening
	 - Our personal sensitivities, stance and emotions get in the way of our understanding. For instance, because we fear looking dense we will refrain from asking clarifying questions. As a result, we'll miss truths and lies.
