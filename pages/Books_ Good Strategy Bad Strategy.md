- Good [[strategy]] doesn't have to be [[complex]]. It usually is [[simple]] and can be obvious. [[complexity]] does not necessarily mean a better strategy.

	- ^^Good strategy requires [[leader]]s who are willing and able to say no to a wide variety of actions and interests.^^ **Strategy is at least as much about what an organization does not do as it is about what it does. **
	  id:: 12a308e6-477d-4bb8-a36f-303b49d12c50
		- ^^A good strategy in itself is a [[competitive advantage]]^^
		  id:: 5fabf612-53c3-471a-b192-f64f6793d083
	- Strategy should be precise, taking into account the one or two [[critical]] issue(s) of the situation--the pivot points that can multiply the effectiveness of effort --- and then focuses, concentrates and invests resources on them. 
	  id:: 8b8e35fe-537a-4c33-a141-dc4aef9de0c5
		- good strategy works by [[focusing]] energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes
		  id:: 98db8220-2fb4-4a14-9b55-35a1119e609e
	- the core strategy work is always the same: discover the critical factors and designing a way of coordinating and focusing actions to deal with those factors.
		- ^^the [[leader]]'s most important responsibility is identifying the biggest challenges to forward progress and to devise a coherent approach to overcoming them. ^^
		  id:: 88b63141-aaf0-42f7-a50f-7aa267b93e14
			- ^^Look forward to the [[future]] to anticipate where we will be going and remove the roadblocks before we get there. Stop being [[reactionary]], instead [[prevent]] problems from occurring by smoothing and paving the road ahead^^ #[[Professional Development]]
	- strategy isn't buzz words and ambitious sounding words but is a clearly defined set of actions to solve a specific defined problem or issue.
		- [[strategy is a cohesive response to an important challenge]]
		  id:: a47a0412-c13b-40b9-b82a-973c0c485085
			- ^^unlike a stand-alone decision or a goal, a strategy transforms [[goals]] into a coherent set of analyses, concepts, policies, arguments, and **actions** that respond to a high-stakes challenge^^
			  id:: 05c861d3-04bf-43af-911c-f0592152480b
		- bad strategy is overbroad and ignores details, the power of choice and focus, and instead focuses on accommodating multiple conflicting [[demand]]s and [[interest]]s.
		  id:: 0548d001-06ea-4b47-b93c-d5761d930027
			- bad strategy employs the language of broad goals, ambition, vision and values. While these elements are important, they are not substitutes for strategy
			  id:: b4ca1932-0264-40c9-b5b5-2605a7790b87
				- strategy should not be a synonym for success, innovation, ambition, drive, zeal or goal setting
				  id:: 55fc9fc4-66eb-4c0e-9465-1a445f0b3457
			- a bad strategy lacks a diagnosis for a guiding policy or coherent actions to be directed at; it is not merely the absence of a good strategy
			  id:: a4a61286-8b1b-4951-9125-493296916c3c
	- ^^a good strategy should be [[honest]] in it's approach and assessment of the problem at hand^^
		- strategy involves [[focus]] and [[choice]], it means setting aside some goals and saying no in favor of others.
- ^^A good strategy is composed of three elements (look for these elements when analyzing a strategy): #[[Decision Making]]^^
  id:: 75a05b57-5b71-4eb6-9594-432d5955d3e9
	- **a diagnosis** 
	  id:: 03713be7-9ac0-4838-90f3-c37883eb629c
		- **defines or explains the nature of the challenge**. A** good diagnosis simplifies **the often the overwhelming complexity of reality by identifying certain aspects of the situation as critical 
		  id:: 0562fe4a-c1cc-4653-bf73-4b57687fbe88
		- A good diagnosis should define an action domain
		  id:: 5e2f7696-172b-4432-b340-0906ba6ab006
	- ^^a guiding [[policy]]^^: specifies the approach to dealing with the obstacles called out in the diagnosis
	  id:: 484071c7-89f7-4988-8fdf-67c3a9fd2c14
		- a **good guiding policies** are not goals or visions or images of desirable end states. Rather they define a method of grappling with the situation and **ruling out a vast array of possible actions.**
		  id:: 623e5967-2b66-4da7-bb2b-634c2105ad64
	- ^^**coherent action** that are carry out the guiding policy^^
	  id:: d4f58549-4e13-45b1-b6fb-5f4110bc3879
		- **sometimes we don't act because the steps will cause pain even thought they are the right actions to take**
		  id:: 1b14c4aa-9580-4813-ae40-e112bb567190
	- ^^examples of good strategy^^
	  id:: 2006354f-c037-40c4-9298-1e9df5da9e1c
		- In many large organizations the challenge is often diagnosed as internal. That is the organization's competitive problems may be much lighter than the obstacles imposed by its own outdated routines, bureaucracy, pools of entrenched interests, lack of cooperation across units, and plain-old bad management. 
		  id:: f5e32d41-d706-486f-8db9-b1ffdb843f72
			- Thus the guiding policy lies in reorganization and renewal. 
			  id:: 7e88b732-030a-4841-82e4-920df29da357
			- The set of coherent actions are changes in people, power and procedures. (from a system's perspectives changing the system first before change people unless those people are owners of the broken system)
			  id:: b9698593-044d-4a03-ab41-eb93f7f58bb5
	- **notice that a good strategy doesn't necessarily need goals, visions, or objectives. These things can inform a good strategy but they aren't strategies in themselves**
	  id:: 0f045381-1ba1-47b1-a3d8-76317f1dd56f
- **Sources of strength for a good strategy:**
	- having a coherent strategy that coordinates **policies** and **actions**.
		- A coordinated and designed policy builds synergistic strength when all actions are motivated and guided by a singular goal/plan/policy
			- ^^strategy must decide on what priorities takes precedence, only then can action be taken^^
	- the creation of new [[strength]]s through subtle shifts in viewpoints
		- identify your own strengths and [[Weaknesses]] to assess [[opportunities]] and [[risk]]s and build your strengths
		- ^^insightful re-[[framing]] of the environment can create new patterns of advantage and weakness to provide impactful feedback loops^^
- ^^the lack of a good strategy maybe due to the presence of a bad strategy^^
  id:: f35290f6-61dd-4732-99f0-cb98935d1807
- Chapter 2 ---- Discovering Power
- ^^Consider the [[competition]] and what others are doing or solving the same problem you have^^
	- when someone has won significantly in a space, others have to fail to compete
	- use your [[advantage]] to impose out-of-proportion ([[asymmetry]]) costs on the opposition and complicate their problem of competing with you.
- Chapter 3 ------------------------------ Bad Strategy
- bad [[strategy]] is not simply absence of good strategy, it grows out of specific [[misconceptions]] and [[leadership]] [[dysfunction]]s. **It is the active avoidance of the hard work of crafting a good strategy. **
  id:: 35483b66-5378-4ad0-87d5-c19067ec8fb1
	- ^^[[bad strategy]] contains the four following hallmarks:^^
	  id:: 2cff361b-0314-4c68-a098-67b61280d4c6
		- [[fluff]]: is form of gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts or arguments. It uses words that are inflated and unnecessarily abstruse to create the illusion of high-level thinking - lacks specificity and details of actions or steps to be taken
		  id:: 86e6b9ad-1013-4be9-b99d-a0772b9d8bba
			- long on goals  but short on policy or action, it assumes goals are all you need
			  id:: 25dac21b-a94f-4d78-b723-24c670ab134e
			- masquerades as [[expertise]], thought, and [[analysis]] 
			  id:: de52cf6c-5d8a-4374-ad3c-693e0e0ec070
		- failure to face the challenge: ^^bad strategy fails to recognize or define the challenge^^  
		  id:: 5354b098-3501-4f4b-9c0f-f1c7c5e6c286
			- [[if the challenge is not defined, it is difficult or impossible to assess the quality of the strategy]]
			  id:: 8166d999-93e3-4a5d-b56b-0c85f5bceecc
			- example: **DARPA's strategy is more than a general direction. It includes specific policies that guide its everyday actions, for example DARPA retains program managers for only four to six years to limit empire building and to bring in fresh talent. The expectation is that a new program manager will be willing to challenge the ideas and work of predecessors. **
			  id:: e1848ae0-74f9-48ec-b49b-c10773c6d509
		- **mistaking goals for strategy**: many bad strategies are statements of desire rather than coordinated actions and policy  
		  id:: a0260229-2582-4d76-8eb6-0e9d250ab083
		- bad strategic objectives: a strategic objective is set by a leader as a means to an end.** Strategic objectives are bad when they fail to address critical issues or when they are impracticable.**
		  id:: ec259d92-e0a0-46e0-a7aa-8d9e206a55f5
			- It is a bad policy of resolving conflict to combine multiple ideas into one strategy for appeasement. There will be no [[incentive]] for anyone to develop and sharpen their arguments. 
			  id:: 1df92661-5c0a-4f11-a30a-80191159befe
- [[planning]] is not strategy. ((88b63141-aaf0-42f7-a50f-7aa267b93e14))
  id:: 14fa742b-08a0-4ac1-965d-3cd5788be670
	- this may require [[innovation]], new approaches, or [[change]] in organizational structure, exploit [[insight]]s into implications of change in the environment --in technology, consumer tastes, laws, resource prices, or competitive behavior.
	  id:: a028ca2c-d5af-4499-9bb7-6f8e97ceafef
- under [[performance]] - when a leader characterizes the [[challenge]] as  under performance, it sets the stage for bad strategy. Under performance is a result, the true challenge are the reasons for the under performance.
- [[blue-sky]] objectives: a simple restatement of the desired state of affairs or of the challenge. It glosses over the fact that there is no plan how to meet and address the challenge.
- Quote: Effective [[leadership]] doesn't depend on [[charisma]]. [[Dwight Eisenhower]], [[George Marshall]], and [[Harry Truman]] were singularly effective leaders, yet none possessed any more charisma than a dead mackerel....Charisma does not by itself guarantee effectiveness as a leader. [[Peter Drucker]]
	- Do not confuse [[leadership]] with [[strategy]]
- ^^Seek [[coordinated policies]] only when the gains are very large.^^ Otherwise keep decision making [[decentralized]]. It is clear to anyone who has belonged to a committee, coordination interrupts and despecializes people.
	- ^^Good strategy and good [[organization]] lie in specializing on the right activities and imposing only the essential amount of coordination.^^
- Part 2 - Sources of [[Power]]
	- **a good strategy works by harnessing power and applying it where it will have the greatest effect**
		- a strategy can increase perceived effectiveness of action by focusing effort on targets that will catch attention and sway opinion.
- ^^every organization faces a situation where the full complexity and ambiguity of the situation is daunting. An important duty of any [[leader]] is to absorb a large part of that complexity and ambiguity, passing on to the organization a simpler problem--one that is solvable.^^
	- Many leaders fail badly at this responsibility, announcing ambitious goals without resolving a good chunk of ambiguity about the specific obstacles to be overcome.
	- **When moving towards the proximate goal (achievable), make sure you have mastered all the necessary skills in order to reach your desired destination**
	  id:: 4458cdf4-6774-42ef-878a-64424add32b4
- **When problems or decisions are too uncertain and too dynamic, the more proximate a strategic objective must be. The proximate object is guided by forecasts of the future, but the more uncertain the future, the more its essential logic is that of "taking a strong position and creating options" to build advantage, not of looking to far ahead. **
- Chapter 8
- A system has [[chain-link]] logic when its performance is limited by its weakest sub-unit, or link. **Where there is a weak link, a chain is not made stronger by strengthening the other links.**
  id:: 8c8b7725-3b3d-49bf-98b7-f7831a472512
- ^^When looking at at system identify the weakest link. Perform chain-link analysis to attain quality matching across teams^^ #[[Decision Making]] #[[Critical Thinking]]
  id:: 33a20be4-d4ff-49cc-94a5-3182a3ef2acb
	- **There is no point in investing resources in making your link better if other links are not**. 
	  id:: 2a18b198-84e5-4a68-ae12-1d33c3f075c5
	- First identify the bottlenecks in the system.
	  id:: ba52853a-d823-4c65-8640-0a567236484c
	- Second be aware that [[incremental]] [[change ]]may not bring in positive changes and may even invite negative criticisms. Only when all changes are enacted to address the bottlenecks will change be visible.
	  id:: 19e60f49-9415-4582-85c6-a557eeedebc5
		- For [[incremental]] [[improvement]]s, shut down the normal systems of local measurements and rewards, refocusing instead on the change itself as the objective.
		  id:: 57c8851a-05b9-4664-8a8e-c0cd8666a8a9
	- Changing a [[chain-link]] system requires direct leadership and design. 
	  id:: a737b200-5958-4441-877d-e77efaf9b673
- Chapter 9 - Using Design
- Elements in strategy are:
	- premeditation
	- anticipation
		- judgment or anticipation concerning the thoughts and/or behavior of others.
- ^^Strategy isn't only [[decision]] making and [[choice]]s but rather systems [[design]]. The system as a whole has to be considered when creating a strategy. The individual parts and the interconnected relationships must be considered.^^
  id:: 59c8d411-586b-44a9-8914-d4a57974023c
	- [[performance]] is a joint outcome of [[capability]] and clever [[design]]
	- A [[design-type]] strategy is an adroit configuration of [[resource]]s and actions that yields an advantage in a challenging situation. Given a set bundle of resources, the greater the competitive challenge, the greater the need for clever, tight, integration of resources and actions. Given a set level of challenge, higher-quality resources lessen the need for the tight integration of resources and actions. 
	  id:: b1e6e5dd-b34f-4c8b-abce-33f69ac31370
		- This principal means that resources and tight [[coordination]] are partial substitutes for each other.
		- Implicit in these principles is the notion that tight integration comes at some cost. A more tightly integrated design is harder to create, narrower in focus, more [[fragile]] in use, and less [[flexible]] in responding to change.
		- ^^Success leads to laxity and bloat, and these lead to [[decline]]. To see effective [[design-type]] strategy, you must look away from the long-successful incumbent toward the company that effectively invades its market space. ^^
- Chapter 10 - Focus
	- ^^If you are serious about [[strategy]] work, you must always do your own [[analysis]].^^ A strategy is not necessarily what the CEO intended or what some executive says it is. #[[Q - How do we create value at work?]]
	  id:: dbe507d6-ff8d-4cfe-939a-49c634984b7a
		- First notice the [[policies]] of the company that are different from the norm in the industry.
		- Then figure out the common target of the distinctive policies--what they are coordinated on accomplishing.
		- A company can carve out a niche in an industry by playing the game with different rules.
			- Example Crown Can company favored creating a niche for short order runs for smaller companies and rush orders. This niche was opposite the other can companies who were commodities by their clients because they favored longer runs. So these companies didn't offer differentiation in their products to maintain their long-term client base.
			- Many companies, especially large complex companies, don't really have strategies. At the core, strategy is about focus, and most complex organizations don't focus their resources. Instead they pursue multiple goals at once, not concentrating enough resources to achieve a breakthrough in any of them.
- Chapter 11 - Growth
	- The proposition that [[growth]] itself creates value is so deeply entrenched in the rhetoric of business that it has an article of almost unquestioned faith that growth is a good thing. **Question strategies centered on growth.**
	  id:: c4886c1c-cfb6-40d7-9be9-5f9d80cdf4aa
		- Healthy growth is not engineered. It is the outcome of growing demand for special capabilities or of expanded capabilities. It is the outcome of a firm having superior products and skills. It is the reward for successful innovation, cleverness, efficiency, and creativity. This kind of growth is not just an industry phenomenon. It normally shows up as a gain in market share that is simultaneous with a superior rate of profit. 
		  id:: d060488f-c0ff-4671-af53-7d4098fddce4
- Chapter 12 - Using [[advantage]]
	- Advantage is rooted in differences and [[asymmetries]] between competing firms. It is the leader's job to identify which asymmetries are critical-which can be turned into important advantages.
		- ^^No one has an advantage at everything. ^^ Teams, organization and even nations have advantages in certain kinds of rivalry under particular conditions.
			- **An advantage in one particular, specific field does not transfer the same advantage or expertise to a different field, even if related.**
	- **If you can afford to, look for advantages years from  now, not a quarter or a year from today. Look to farther out into the future, secure and protect you advantage**
	  id:: 70d831af-9086-4168-b7d1-40c1ea4b2e00
	- You cannot expect to make money-to get wealthier-by simply having, buying, or selling competitive advantage. The connection between competitive advantage and wealth is dynamic. Wealth increases when competitive advantage increases or when the demand for the resources underlying it increases.
		- Increasing value requires a strategy for progress on at least one of four different fronts:
		  id:: 90135577-6503-4b13-bbba-8a7a026f98c3
			- deepening advantages
			  id:: 79e5d7af-f8f8-4f94-b119-952f16ae6155
			- broadening the extent of advantages
			  id:: 8f992665-e2a8-411a-99bf-f641d5ce095b
			- creating higher demand for advantaged products or services
			  id:: 5735de7f-b0fa-43f5-b11c-5e0e2e13e4ef
			- strengthening the isolating that block easy replication and imitation by competitors
			  id:: 6d7ce425-e080-43a1-bec5-eb41151fadfe
- **Increasing advantage depth by defining advantage in terms of surplus-the gap between buyer value and cost. **
	- ^^[[improvement]] is not a natural process or it can be accomplished by pressure or incentives alone.  [[improvements]] come from reexamining the details of how work is done, not just from cost controls or incentives. ^^
		- Improving products is similar except with the additional complexity of examining and observing buyers and clients, a more difficult task than examine one's own work process.
			- Companies that excel at product development and improvement carefully study the attitudes, decision and feelings of buyers. They develop a special empathy for customers and anticipate problems before they occur.
- ^^Extending a [[competitive advantage]] requires looking away from products, buyers and competitors and looking instead at the special skills and resources that underlie a competitive advantage. In other words, "Build on your strengths."^^
- The work of discerning whether there are important changes afoot involves getting into the gritty details. ^^To make good bets on how a wave of change will play out you must acquire enough expertise to question the experts. ^^
- Good engineers and good software engineers are both expensive. The big difference lies in the cost of prototyping, upgrading, and, especially, the cost of fixing a mistake. Design always involve a certain amount of trial and error, and hardware trials and errors, and hardware trials and errors are much more costly.
- Deconstructed
	- [[Question: If a parts of [[system]] can't [[integrate]] well, instead of increasing the quality of relationships or interconnections, can we make each system smart enough at their core function that the need for quality relationship and interconnections  is lessened?]]
- Awareness to change - transitions
	- Guidepost 1 - Rising Fixed cost
		- The simplest form of [[transition]] is triggered by substantial increase in fixed costs, especially product development
			- This substantial increase may force the industry to consolidate because only the largest competitors can cover these fixed charges (ex. hospital networks)
	- Guide post 2 - Deregulation
		- Many major transitions are triggered by major changes in government policy, especially deregulation
			- Regulated prices are almost always arranged to subsidize some buyers at the expense of others
	- Guide post 3 - Predictable biases
		- In seeing what is happening during a change it is helpful to understand that you will be surrounded by predictable biases in forecasting.
	- Guide post 4  - Incumbent response
		- Understand the structure of incumbent response to a wave of change. In general we expect incumbent firms to resist a transition that threatens to undermine the complex skills and valuable positions they have accumulated over time.
	- Guide post 5 - attractor state
		- An attractor state provides a sense of direction for the future evolution of an industry. There is no guarantee that this state will come to be, but it does represent a gravity like pull. The critical distinction between an attractor state and many corporate  "visions" is that the attractor state is based on overall efficiency rather than a single company's desire to capture most of the pie.
- Chapter 14 - Inertia and Entropy
	- [[entropy]] makes it necessary for leaders to constantly work on maintaining an organization's purpose, form, and methods even if there are no changes in strategy or competition
	- **the inertia of routine**
		- [[standardization]], standard of operations, and any [[routine]]s can limit [[innovation]] and novel solutions to problems. Build in processes in your organization to promote innovation and reflection on current routines
		  id:: 38fa3ef8-4e35-421c-bf5e-0a62e56d6387
		- the inertia of routines can be revealed by shocks, creating a significant gap between the old routines and the need to create new workflows in response to the shocks 
		  id:: 9b23aa1f-ce44-4995-a6c1-830951b662b3
		- inertia due to obsolete or inappropriate routines can be fixed. The barriers are the perceptions of top management. If senior leaders are convinced that new routines are essential, change can be quick. 
		  id:: 29e68b2a-e10a-4169-8a13-dc51538a3251
	- the [[inertia]] of culture
		- culture are the social behavior and meaning that are stable and resist change
		  id:: c985a778-0d75-4b41-9b58-a3cb472c7bef
			- it is dangerous to think that organizational culture can be changed quickly or easily
			  id:: e10126b3-b35f-4f83-a171-60510c544b8c
			- the first step in breaking organizational culture inertia is [[simplification]]. This helps to eliminate the complex routines, processes, and hidden bargains among units that mask waste and inefficiency. Strip out excess layers of [[administration]] and halt nonessential operations--sell them off, close them down, spin them off, or outsource the services. 
			  id:: 9f7928b3-792d-4ff1-970c-197d68a5d885
			- changing a unit's culture means changing its member's work norms and work-related values. In general, to change the group's norms, the alpha member must be replaced
			  id:: f8228eea-bfa7-4cce-9626-7e67bde36f3a
	- Inertia by Proxy
		- A business may choose to not respond to change or attack because responding would undermine still-valuable streams of profit that persists because of their customer's inertia-a form of proxy inertia.
			- For example if customer's are slow to change to a newer product, the company selling may not choose to keep selling the old product because their customers still buy the old versions
- Entropy
	- Regarding Silicon Graphics response to Nvidia: McCracken's "Grow by 50 percent" is classic bad strategy. It is the kind of nonsense that passes as strategy in too many companies. First, he was setting a goal, not designing a way to deal with his company's challenge. Second, growth is the outcome of a successful strategy, and attempts to engineer growth are exercises in magical thinking.
- Thinking Like a Strategist
	- In creating strategy it is important to take on the viewpoints of others, see how the situation looks to a rival or customer. 
	  id:: cfd9cd89-5f30-4195-819c-3179242b9861
- Chapter 16 - The Science of Strategy
	- A good strategy is built on functional [[knowledge]] about what works, what doesn't, and why. General available functional knowledge is essential, but because it is available to all, it can rarely be decisive or advantageous. **The most precious functional knowledge is proprietary, available only to your organization.**
	  id:: 910f05a2-4d4f-495d-ace8-4bb17f9c5517
		- Where does scientific knowledge come from? You know the process. A good scientist pushes to the edge of knowledge and then reaches beyond, forming a conjectureâ€”a hypothesisâ€”about how things work in that unknown territory. If the scientist avoids the edge, working with what is already well known and established, life will be comfortable, but there will be neither fame nor honor.
		  id:: 1c0b1078-5a65-476f-b87c-dac207ab5f34
		- In the same way, a good business strategy deals with the edge between the known and the unknown. Again, it is competition with others that pushes us to edges of knowledge. Only there are found the opportunities to keep ahead of rivals. There is no avoiding it. That uneasy sense of ambiguity you feel is real. It is the scent of opportunity.

		- In science, you first test a new conjecture against known laws and experience. Is the new hypothesis contradicted by basic principles or by the results of past experiments? If the hypothesis survives that test, the scientist has to devise a real-world testâ€”an experimentâ€”to see how well the hypothesis stands up.
		  id:: 460e1d0d-560e-47d3-8ed0-5e447472d957
		- Similarly, we test a new strategic insight against well-established principles and against our accumulated knowledge about the business. If it passes those hurdles, we are faced with trying it out and seeing what happens.
		  id:: e72b075d-c5f0-407b-b4a4-98659685eca6
		- Given that we are working on the edge, asking for a strategy that is guaranteed to work is like asking a scientist for a hypothesis that is guaranteed to be trueâ€”it is a dumb request. The problem of coming up with a good strategy has the same logical structure as the problem of coming up with a good scientific hypothesis. The key differences are that most scientific knowledge is broadly shared, whereas you are working with accumulated wisdom about your business and your industry that is unlike anyone elseâ€™s.

		- A good strategy is, in the end, a hypothesis about what will work. Not a wild theory, but an educated judgment.

	- In a world of change and flux, "more of the same" is rarely the right answer. In a changing world, a good strategy must have an entrepreneurial component. It must embody some ideas or insights into new combinations of resources dealing with news [[risks]] and [[opportunities]].
	- Treating [[strategy]] like a problem in [[deduction]] assumes that anything worth knowing is already known--that only computation is required.

- [[anomalies]]
	- an anomaly is a fact that doesn't fit received wisdom. It marks an [[opportunity]] to [[learn]] something, perhaps something very valuable. In science, anomalies are the frontier where the action is.
- explore the intersection what is [[important]] and what is [[actionable]]
	- making a [[list]] is a basic tool for overcoming our own cognitive limitations. The itself counters forgetfulness. The act of making a list forces us to reflect on the relative urgency and importance of issues.
	- being [[strategic]] means being less myopic--less shortsighted-- than others. You must perceive and take into account what others do not, be they colleagues or rivals.

- Experience and Strategy habits
	- To create a strategy in any arena requires a great deal of knowledge about the specifics. There is no substitute for on-the-ground experience. This experience accumulates in the form of associations between  situations and "what works" or "what can happen" in those situations.

- Problem-Solution
	- Many attempts at strategy lack a good diagnosis. It is useful to have mental tools for working backwards from a guiding policy to the realm of diagnosis and fact.
		- Identify the difficulties and obstacles will give us a clearer picture of the pattern of existing and possible strategies. To gain this [[perspective]], shift our attention from what is being done to why it is being done., from the directions chosen to the problems that these choices address.
- Create-Destroy
	- Overcoming [[quick closure]] is simple in principle: we look for additional insights and strategies. But, most of the time, we simply add one or two shallow alternatives to our initial insight. We seem to resis developing several robust strategies.
		- quick closure is adopting and investing the in the first strategy or idea formed as a solution to a question or problem
		- a new [[alternative]] should flow from a reconsideration of the facts of the situation, and it should also address the weaknesses of any already developed alternatives.
			- the creation of new higher quality alternatives requires that we "destroy" any existing alternative, exposing their fault lines and internal contradictions.
				- have an imagined panel of experts to destroy your ideas by asking questions.
					- "Explain why anyone should be listening to you and what the implication actions is."
					- "Speak in historical trends and the power of scope and scale to build enduring enterprises"
	- good judgment is hard to define and harder still to acquire. For practice of good judgment to be effective we should first commit to writing our judgments.
	  id:: e2ff9ee6-54ad-4e4d-a41b-a64e03e07f14
		- by committing to a judgment-especially a diagnosis- we will increase  the probability that we will disagree with some of the assessments of others, and thereby increase the chance of [[learning]] something
