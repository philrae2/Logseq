- Description: 
	 - We are often pushed by society to consume and take away resources to get to the top. That we should strive to be number one. Usually this competition is not collaborative and there can only be one winner, everyone else are losers.
		 - This mindset creates destruction not only in our relationships but also in how we are perceived by others. We maybe come off as looking successful, but we can be secretly despised by others.

		 - A better approach to attaining success in business is to create value for others.
