	- Dual Track Agile and Continuous Discovery Processes
	  collapsed:: true
		- In agile software development, the discovery process refers to the activities and techniques used to gather information, uncover requirements, and gain a deeper understanding of the problem space. It is an iterative and collaborative approach that involves cross-functional teams working closely with stakeholders to identify and validate user needs, define project goals, and explore potential solutions. Here are some common discovery processes in agile:
		- 1. User Research: This involves conducting interviews, surveys, and observations to gather insights about user behaviors, goals, and pain points. User research helps teams understand the target audience and their needs, which informs the product development process.
		- 2. Stakeholder Interviews: Engaging with stakeholders, such as product owners, business analysts, and subject matter experts, helps gather their perspectives, priorities, and expectations. These interviews help align the team with the overall vision and ensure that the project goals are well-defined.
		- 3. User Personas: Creating user personas involves developing fictional representations of typical users based on research findings. Personas encapsulate user characteristics, goals, behaviors, and pain points. They serve as a reference throughout the development process to keep user needs in focus.
		- 4. User Stories: User stories are brief, descriptive narratives that capture a user's requirement or need. They are typically written in the format: "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]." User stories help prioritize features and guide development by focusing on user value.
		- 5. Design Thinking Workshops: Design thinking workshops bring together stakeholders, designers, developers, and users to generate ideas, explore different perspectives, and co-create solutions. These workshops encourage collaborative problem-solving and foster innovation.
		- 6. Prototyping/pretotyping: Prototyping involves creating low-fidelity or high-fidelity representations of the product or specific features. Prototypes can be paper-based, digital mockups, or interactive simulations. They help validate ideas, gather feedback, and refine the product's design.
		- 7. User Testing: User testing involves observing and gathering feedback from real users as they interact with the product or prototype. It helps identify usability issues, understand user preferences, and validate design decisions.
		- 8. Continuous Feedback: Agile teams emphasize frequent feedback loops with stakeholders and users throughout the development process. This can be in the form of demos, reviews, retrospectives, and constant communication to ensure that the project is on track and meeting expectations.
