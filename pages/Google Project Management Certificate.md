- [[Project Initiation: Starting a Successful Project]]
	 - Initiation Phase
		 - The initiation phase is a crucial time for asking stakeholders to write questions, performing research, determining resources, and clearly documenting the key components of a project. Doing this will help you solidify the scope, or the boundary, of the project

		 - Without sufficient understanding of the project's goals, you might underestimate what resources you need or how long the project might take. Or, without agreeing with stakeholders on what success looks like, you might think the project was completed successfully, while the stakeholders might think it didn't accomplish their goals

		 - Initiation phase components
			 - [[goals]]
				 - To set up a project for success and to make your job easier, you want to figure out what needs to be done before you actually get started. You need to define exactly what your goals and deliverables are so that you'll be able to tell your team members what to do. You need a clear picture of what you're trying to accomplish, how you're going to accomplish it, and how you know when that has been accomplished. 

				 - The goal is what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve. All projects should have clear goals, and often those will be determined by senior company leaders with your help. 
					 - Don't rely only on your stakeholders to state the goals, if it is within your ability to improve the goals, do so.  Often stakeholders will have a shift of their goals during the development process that can affect the project's success. 

				 - One of the biggest differences between what makes a good goal and a not-so-good goal is how well it's defined‚Äîmeaning, how clear and specific is the goal? If the goal is your destination, are you confident you'll know when you've arrived?
					 - Well-defined goals are [[SMART]]
						 - __Specific__ - The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret. If your goal is not specific, you'll have trouble figuring out how long it should take to complete and whether or not you've accomplished it
							 - Specific goals should answer at least two of the following questions. 
								 - What do I want to accomplish? 

								 - Why is this a goal? 

								 - Does it have a specific reason, purpose, or benefit? 

								 - Who is involved, and who is the recipient: employees, customers, the community at large? 

								 - Where should the goal be delivered? And finally, to what degree? In other words, what are the requirements and constraints? 

						 - __Measurable__: Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.
							 - we want to set goals that are measurable, meaning we can determine that they were objectively met. Measuring is not only a way for people to track progress but also a tool to help people stay motivated. You can tell if a goal is measurable by asking how much, how many, and how will I know when it's accomplished? Sometimes, the success of a goal can be measured with a simple yes or no. Did you learn how to play guitar, yes or no? You will need to measure most of the goals you have with metrics. Metrics are what you use to measure something like figures or numbers. For example, if your goal was to run a 5K (five-kilometer race), then "distance in kilometers" is your metric.

							 - Consider benchmarks previous numbers compared to future state.

						 - __Attainable__
							 - Can your goal be reasonably reached based on the metrics? Typically, you want goals that are a little challenging to encourage growth. Otherwise, what's the point of the goal if nothing's going to change? However, you don't want it to be too extreme or you'll never reach it. You'll have failed before you even started. Aim to find a balance between the two extremes

							 - A clue to helping you figure out if your goal is attainable is to ask, how can it be accomplished? Breakdown the goal into smaller parts, and see if it makes sense.

						 - __Relevant__
							 - Does it make sense to try and reach this goal? Think about how the goal lines up with other goals, priorities, and values. Ask whether the goal seems worthwhile. Does the effort involved balance out the benefits? Does it match your organization's other needs and priorities? Everyone from the client and the project team and the people who will ultimately use the product need to feel like the goal is worth supporting.

						 - __Timebound__
							 - Time-bound means your goal has a deadline. Deadlines give you a way to track your progress. Otherwise, you may never reach your goal or never even get started. Time and metrics often go hand in hand, because time can also be used as a metric. Making your goal time-bound gives you a way to break down how much needs to be accomplished over time

			 - **Objectives and Key Results: Building and implementing OKRs**
				 - OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a** **measurable outcome.
					 - The **objective**, or goal, portion of the OKR defines what needs to be achieved. It describes a desired outcome, such as an increase in customer retention or an improvement in the employee onboarding process.

					 - The **key** **results**, or metric, part of the OKR defines how you will tangibly measure the success of your initiatives. It describes the standards of measurement that capture the efficacy, performance, or quality of your objective, such as amount of revenue earned or a number of units sold.

				 - OKRs are shared across the organization so that all teams have a clear understanding of the company‚Äôs goals and can align and focus their efforts to help the company reach those goals. For instance, project managers will often reference company-wide OKRs when setting their individual project OKRs in an attempt to align and bridge a connection.

				 - OKRs are popular because they provide a path for clear, actionable goals. There are five major benefits for OKRs, which make up the acronym FACTS:
					 - **Focus**: OKRs provide focus. They help zoom in on the few important initiatives that can make an immediate, consequential difference while postponing less urgent ones.

					 - **Alignment**: OKRs create transparency amongst teams, organizations, and even managers and their direct reports. OKRs are typically documented and shared with everyone for visibility.

					 - **Commitment**: OKRs serve as a social contract between teams, individuals, and the organization.

					 - **Tracking**: OKRs can be tracked against the commitment to gauge performance.

					 - **Stretch**: OKRs provide stretch opportunities and encourage individuals to challenge themselves to achieve a larger goal.

				 - **Implementing OKRs across organizations**
					 - Since OKRs are often implemented across an organization, they help all team members see the measurable objectives and key results of a company-wide initiative. They ensure that even the most junior employees understand how their focused effort can help the company achieve its goals.

					 - As the project manager for a project with multiple teams and timelines but one overall goal, using OKRs can help you identify both your overarching needs and the deliverables you‚Äôll need from each team member to fulfill the larger goals. You can use OKRs to help motivate your team since their goals can be both short- and long-term.

					 - Within a company, you could have OKRs on the strategic, tactical,** **and operational** **levels:
						 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FazcOilOzkL.png?alt=media&token=4f9e9b87-56af-4eac-9d72-09b9677010fa)

				 - **Building purposeful OKRs**
					 - When you build OKRs for a project, your aim is to determine the **why**, **the** **what**, and the**how** The __why__ is the purpose. Why is your project significant? The __what__ is the objective. What are you trying to accomplish? And the __how__ is the key results. How are you going to accomplish your objective?
						 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2F7WZHlBsOH_.png?alt=media&token=8beb0488-d479-4dc7-9d4b-3d7ee65ff3be)

					 - When creating OKRs, you will follow these four essential steps:
						 - **Define your purpose.** Identify the team‚Äôs mission.

						 - **Build out your objective. **What are the project‚Äôs goals?

						 - **Develop 2‚Äì3 key results for your objective. **How will you know when the objective has been met?

						 - **Write 3‚Äì5 key initiatives that you will work towards to make progress on your OKRs.**

				 - Let‚Äôs look at an example of an OKR at the company level:

				 - **OBJECTIVE:** Improve employee satisfaction

				 - **KEY RESULTS:**
					 - Maintain an employee retention rate of 80%

					 - Annual employee satisfaction survey score improves by 20%

					 - 50% of employees are actively participating in a mentorship program

				 - ![Line break](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/accV1Wc8TMuHFdVnPCzLUg_9c4bc2847ff94a5ca2b3954817f170f0_short-line---y.png?expiry=1617321600000&hmac=dQhR-6bjgnhnPDE0KWr1RnWn1QdT5w5ihGiAV4V1i00)

				 - In the example above, we have identified what our end goal or objective is ‚Äúto improve our employee satisfaction‚Äù and then we have defined the key results that would indicate successfully meeting that goal.

				 - Our key initiatives for this OKR might include:
					 - Launch a pilot of the mentorship program to 40 junior analysts and 20 senior managers.

					 - Build a feedback survey and reporting dashboard.

					 - Host three employee well-being sessions.

				 - **Communicating and tracking an OKR**
					 - Since so many teams are involved in tracking OKRs, communication is key. Here are some key tips for maintaining clear communication when tracking OKRs:
						 - Establish the frequency with which you will check in with your team and senior managers on how your project is performing against the OKRs you set. Choose a cadence that makes sense for your team. For example, for operational OKRs with a team, you may want to check in weekly. For tactical OKRs of an area, you may want to check in biweekly or monthly. For strategic OKRs for your company, you may want to check in quarterly.

						 - Formalize this process.** **For instance, build your OKRs at the end of each quarter for the upcoming quarter. Then, execute your OKRs and score** **how you measured up against them at the end of that quarter.**¬†**

						 - Scoring your OKRs is an important part of the cycle to track and share your progress. Define how your OKRs will be scored. For example, will you use a percentage of the objective complete to determine your score? Will you score based on the completion of certain milestones? Will you use traffic lights (red, yellow, green) to score OKRs? (For example, did you clearly achieve the objective? Green. Did you fail? Red. Were you in the middle? Yellow.) From here, you can prioritize what you need to focus on in the future to improve.

			 - **Scope**
				 - The way we define it at Google is "an agreed-upon understanding as to what is included or excluded from a project.

				 - The scope captures the expectations, goals, and needs of the project. If documented properly, you are able to use the scope to keep the project on track and easily identify when a task is outside of the scope. Building, documenting, and agreeing on the scope of the project sets the foundation for project management.

				 - Scope provides an overarching framework of what is and is not included in the project statement of work and deliverables. Defining the scope helps identify the necessary resources, the resource costs, and a project schedule.

				 - Make sure all stakeholders agree on the scope and document.
					 - Make sure to gain alignment on what is included and what isn't included in the scope. Make this very visible. #[[Lessons Learned]]

					 - You want to start figuring out the scope early on so that everyone can agree to the same set of expectations. Once you understand your project scope, you want to document all the details so that anyone can refer back to it throughout the life cycle of the project.

				 - > It's your job as a project manager to set and maintain firm boundaries for your project so that your team can stay on track.

				 - **Asking scope-defining questions**
					 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FQvLU0GokMX.png?alt=media&token=8ce28b81-d33f-40b9-8b3d-d659bb804db8)

				 - **Scope Creep**
					 - By identifying scope creep and being proactive, you protect your project and your project team. To help you combat scope creep, it's good to know that there are two major sources from which it comes: external and internal. 
						 - __External sources of scope creep__ are easier to recognize. For example, if you're working on a project with one main customer, the customer might request changes, or the business environment around you might shift, or the underlying technology you're using might change.  
							 - First, make sure the stakeholders have visibility into the project. You want them to know the details of what's going to be produced, what resources are required, how much it will cost, and how much time it'll take. 

							 - Also, get clarity on the requirements and ask for constructive criticism of the initial product proposal. It's important to get this information before any contracts are signed. 

							 - Be sure to set ground rules and expectations for stakeholder involvement once the project gets started. Come to an agreement on each of your roles and responsibilities during execution and status reviews. 

							 - Plan for how to deal with out-of-scope requests. Agree on who can make formal change requests and how those requests will be evaluated, accepted, and performed. And finally, be sure to get these agreements in writing. This way, you'll always have documentation to point if you, a stakeholder, or the customer have a disagreement down the line. 

							 - One of the leading causes of external scope creep is not being clear on the requirements before defining the scope and getting formal approval to move forward with the project.  If the requirements aren't specific and if you haven't agreed on the project's processes, deliverables, and milestones, then you're almost guaranteed to be dealing with scope creep once the project begins. 

						 - __Internal sources of scope creep__are trickier to spot and harder to control. This kind of creep comes from members of the project team who suggest or even insist on process or product changes or improvements. 
							 - What you need to make clear to your team is that any change outside of the project scope comes off the bottom line, threatens the schedule, and increases risk.

							 - The best defense is to know the details of your project in and out so you're always prepared with the most appropriate response to a new idea or request.

						 - You need a clear understanding of the project priorities. You have to know what is most important when it comes to scope, time, and cost. If there's a specific deadline that must be met, then you need to limit any changes to the scope that might cause the project to go past the deadline.

			 - Project deliverables

			 - **Success criteria - Measuring a project's success**
				 - Launches are not a meaningful measure of success. Landing is the key step to measure our success criteria. The success criteria includes all the specific details of our goals and deliverables.

				 - **Launching vs. landing a project**
					 - In project management, a project ‚Äúlaunching‚Äù means you have delivered the final results of the project to the client or user. You can‚Äôt solely base project success on when the client accepts the project, though. Your work on a project won‚Äôt be complete until you ‚Äúland‚Äù it by thoroughly measuring the results. This is when the [[success criteria]] and the metrics you defined initially when setting SMART goals will come in handy.

					 - Teams should be clear on what they are trying to accomplish, beyond just launching something to users. Will your project increase retention? Will your project speed up a product feature? Depending on the product and situation, the answers will differ, but it is important that your team aligns and works toward the same measurable goal.

				 - **Tracking and communicating success criteria**
					 - __Product quality¬†__
						 - The product, or final result, of a project has its own set of attributes that define success. The product attributes that are necessary for the product‚Äôs success include completeness in features, quality of features, unit cost, usability, etc. The extent that a product is complete will contribute to the product‚Äôs success. This can apply to any project in which you deliver a product or tangible outcome at the end. To keep us on track for success, we can create a list of product requirements to ensure that you do not miss anything. For example, if the project produces word processing software, you need basic features like text entry, formatting, saving, and printing. Since you require each feature to have a functional word processor by today‚Äôs standards, you include these features on your checklist.

						 - To measure the success of a product, consider including these metrics on your checklist:
							 - Track if you implemented the product‚Äôs priority requirements

							 - Track and assess the product‚Äôs number of technical issues or defects

							 - Measure the percentage of features you delivered or released at the end of the project

					 - __What is important to the customers or stakeholders__
						 - We have to pay attention to product metrics, but we also have to be mindful of stakeholder and customer additional expectations for features and objectives. In the word processor example, a stakeholder may want to add an additional functionality to easily create tables in a document with text. Additionally, a strategic goal of the organization could be to create word processor software with more collaborative ability than the word processors currently on the market. Each component is necessary in order to meet customer and stakeholder expectations. Think about what needs the project satisfies for your stakeholders or customers. These strategic goals tie back to the business case and the reason you initiated the project in the first place. Often, you can measure the fulfillment of strategic goals via user or customer metrics. Metrics to consider include:
							 - Evaluating user engagement with the product

							 - Measuring stakeholder and customer satisfaction via surveys

							 - Tracking user adoption of the product by using sales data

					 - __Document, align, and communicate success__
						 - Understanding where we are and where we are going helps the project team determine if they are on track. As you learned in the video on this topic, you need to get clarity from stakeholders on the project requirements and expectations. There are many people involved with any project, and success will look different for each of them. You want to ask questions, such as: Who ultimately says whether or not the project is successful? What criteria will be measured to determine success? What is the success of this project based on?¬†It is best practice to get the key stakeholders or the steering committee to review and approve your success criteria. This becomes a mutual agreement on how all parties define the success of the project.

				 - **Key takeaway**
					 - Remember, all projects encounter change. All parties must have continuous access and alignment to the success criteria agreed upon to avoid scope creep (uncontrolled change of the project‚Äôs scope) or failed expectations at the end of the project. It‚Äôs important to document success criteria upfront and continue to report on it throughout the project.

				 - Using OKRs to measure outcomes
					 - [What Matters: OKR Online Course: Getting Started With OKRs 101](https://www.whatmatters.com/get-started/)

					 - __Objectives__ - The "why" behind the objectives is a critical component of OKR. 
						 - As we build an objective, starting with the "why", we also need to ask ourselves "what" is behind the project. 
							 - What are the clear and specific actions that the team needs to take to complete the project? Passive or unclear objectives are hard to carry out and, more importantly, hard to measure. How can we expect our team to complete an objective if it isn‚Äôt clear? That is why it is so important to clearly understand stakeholder input. We need to create objectives that are clear, action-oriented, and have measurable results.

					 - __Key results__
						 - To start measuring results we must make sure that we understand how the "why" influences our results.

						 - Two key metrics to measures is adoption and engagement

			 - **Stakeholders**
				 - Managing Different Stakeholder expectations

					 - Understand, assess and adapt
						 - __Understand__ ‚Äì What is the position each stakeholder has?
							 - We need to understand not only each stakeholder's position but also why (the motivating factors). 

							 - Also consider their position relative to other stakeholders.

						 - __Assess__ ‚Äì How does that position compare with the organizational view of the project?
							 - We have to assess which stakeholders carry the most weight and most important. We naturally assume the sponsor is the most important‚Äîwe should validate this and look for their bias.

							 - While the sponsor likely has the most accurate assessment of the project at the start, be prepared to assess their motives if the project experiences challenges along the way. 

							 - You must assess the motivations, biases and perspectives of all stakeholders throughout the project, because that is what drives your actions‚Äîthe adapt piece of our three steps.

						 - __Adapt __‚Äì Adjust elements of the project to manage any variance between views and  perspectives.
							 - Adapt communications depending on the needs of each stakeholder. Don't take short cuts by sending one general updates or progress e-mail. One general e-mail will not satisfy or meet individual stakeholders' needs.
								 - Tailor your communications, keeping in mind what each stakeholder considers important.

								 - Provide context, explain why changes have occurred and how problems are being solved.

					 - ^^Stakeholder analysis^^
						 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2F-ZcVp_sXI4.png?alt=media&token=0b116d69-095a-4b35-8120-f95e42ca864c)

						 - Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts. When generating this list, ask yourself: Who is invested in the project? Who is impacted by this project? Who contributes to this project? 
							 - To best manage **key stakeholders**, you'll want to closely partner with them to reach the desired outcomes.

							 - You'll find stakeholders with higher influence but lower interest in the top left corner of the grid. To manage these stakeholders, you'll want to consult with them and meet their needs. Their opinions and input are important to the project. 

							 - Stakeholders with lower influence but high interest are in the right bottom corner of the grid. For these stakeholders, you'll want to show consideration for them by keeping them up-to-date on the project. It's unlikely they'll need a say in what's going on, but keeping them informed is important.

							 - We have stakeholders with low influence and low interest. You'll find these in the bottom left corner. They're the least important of the stakeholders, but this doesn't mean that they don't matter. It might just be that for this particular project, they aren't as integral. So for this project, you mainly want to monitor them, keeping them in the know.

						 - Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder‚Äîthis step helps you determine who your key stakeholders are. The higher the level of interest and influence, the more important it will be to prioritize their needs throughout the project. 

						 - Assess stakeholders‚Äô ability to participate and then find ways to involve them. Various types of projects will yield various types of stakeholders‚Äîsome will be active stakeholders with more opinions and touchpoints and others will be passive stakeholders, preferring only high-level updates and not involved in the day-to-day. That said, just because a stakeholder does not participate as often as others does not mean they are not important. There are lots of factors that will play a role in determining a stakeholder‚Äôs ability to participate in a project, like physical distance from the project and their existing workload. 

						 - **Pro tip: **You might want to form a **steering committee** during some projects. A steering committee is a collection of key stakeholders who have a high level of power and interest in a project. A steering committee can influence multiple departments within the organization, which means that they have the potential to release a greater number of resources to the project manager.

						 - **Generating stakeholder buy-in¬†**
							 - Once you organize and assess your stakeholders, it is time to start making some decisions on whose buy-in is absolutely necessary for success, whose requirements deserve the most attention, and what level of communication each stakeholder will require.

							 - Gaining key stakeholder buy-in is essential to ensuring that your project is not deprioritized or deprived of resources.

							 - Tips for gaining key stakeholder buy-in include:
								 - Clearly mapping the work of the project to the goals of the stakeholder.

								 - Describing how the project aligns with the goals of the stakeholder's department or team.

								 - Listening to feedback from the stakeholder and finding ways to incorporate their feedback into the project's charter where appropriate.

							 - Manage your stakeholders‚Äô expectations by presenting a realistic view of your team‚Äôs abilities. Do not over-promise and under-deliver!

			 - **Resources**
				 - Choosing a project team
					 - Consider the project needs

					 - Consider the roles needed

					 - Team size

					 - Necessary Skills

					 - Consider availability and motivation to complete their tasks or commitment
						 - Motivation is a key ingredient for project success

					 - Is your team diverse?
						 - Diverse teams contributes to a more successful project because it allows for unique perspectives, skills, and talents that can be leveraged as different approaches to problem solving

						 - Diversity has to be openly acknowledged 

				 - Defining Project roles
					 - __Project Sponsor__ - the person who's accountable for the project and who ensures the project delivers the agreed upon business benefits.

					 - __Team Member__ - the people doing the work and making things happen

					 - __Customers__  - The people who will get some value from a successfully landed project

					 - __Stakeholders__ - Anyone involved in the project who has a vested interest in the project's success.
						 - A primary stakeholder is directly affected by the outcome of the project
							 - Primary stakeholders usually include team members, senior leaders, and customers.

						 - while a secondary stakeholder is indirectly affected by the outcome of the project.

					 - __Project Manager__ - is responsible for the overall success of the team and ultimately the project as a whole.
						 - A project manager understands that paying close attention to team dynamics is essential to successfully completing a project, and they use team-building techniques, motivation, influencing, decision-making, and coaching skills, to keep their teams strong.

						 - Project managers integrate all project work by developing the project management plan, directing the work, documenting reports, controlling change, and monitoring quality.

						 - And so at the end of the day, really the challenge is understanding the dynamics of the people that you work with. I like to say that the key about program management is people and contexts. You have to understand the people that you're working with, you have to understand the context, and only then can you apply the skills that you learned. You won't always have the opportunity to pick and choose what people you want to work on a project, and that's okay, because you can just use those tools that you've gained in the past to understand the backgrounds and the style and the personalities of the people that you're working with. The most important part about program management is understanding the personalities of the people you work with so that you can tailor your approach to make sure that you're working effectively with them.

			 - Assigning project team roles and responsibilities
				 - [[RACI]] Chart
					 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FA6liNCisjW.png?alt=media&token=062b1a77-e29e-44f9-9642-6d8f7054870d)

					 - Responsible - Those doing the work to complete the task

					 - Accountable - Those making sure the work gets done
						 - There should only be one person accountable for tasks or deliverables to prevent confusion and overlap of this responsibility

					 - Consulted - Those giving feedback including subject matter experts and decision makers

					 - Informed - Those needing to know final decisions, or that a task is complete

				 - While communication is usually a good thing, too much communication can actually make things more complicated. It can cause information overload where people don't know what to pay attention to, and so they miss something important

				 - When should you use a RACI chart?
					 - If you are wondering if you should use a RACI chart on your project, it is a good idea to evaluate the complexity of the effort. For example, if you have a very small project team with a small amount of stakeholders, clearly defined roles, and a short timeline, introducing a RACI chart could possibly slow down the project. However, larger projects, or even projects that involve a large number of stakeholders, could greatly benefit from a RACI chart. It is always a good idea to work through the creation of a RACI chart and evaluate the outcome. Even if you do not end up using the RACI chart, you will have a better understanding of the project, and your effort will contribute to your project management experience overall.

			 - ^^Why projects fail: Initiation missteps^^
				 - **Unclear expectations¬†**
					 - You may remember the questions you need to answer at the start of the initiation phase of the project, including:
						 - What is the end goal?

						 - What are the expected deliverables and schedule?

						 - What is the budget?

						 - Who are the stakeholders?

					 - Not taking the time at the beginning of a project to ask essential questions, document decisions, and understand the true scope of the project may lead to failure. After all, without directions, you can never reach your destination.

				 - **Unrealistic expectations**
					 - We all like to impress our managers, but sometimes, we accidentally agree to unrealistic expectations and set our projects up for failure from the start. For example, if a project is expected to take two weeks due to the level of detail and effort required but we try to complete it in one week, we will not have the resources available to meet the consolidated schedule. This will likely result in quality issues. It‚Äôs important to understand the requirements of a project before agreeing to any deadlines. As a best practice, don't commit to firm dates when initiating the project to avoid setting unrealistic expectations. You will have more information and will be able to better manage expectations in the planning phase.

				 - **Miscommunication**
					 - Clear communication is key. If information is not communicated in a timely manner, does not include pertinent information (risks, decisions made, scope changes, etc.), or is not sent to the correct stakeholders, then you may be setting yourself up for failure. Conducting a stakeholder analysis and then utilizing a RACI chart to understand which stakeholders should be kept informed or consulted is a great start to creating an effective communication strategy.

					 - As a project manager, you do not necessarily have to cater to everyone‚Äôs unique communication styles, but you do have to set expectations about how communication will occur. As you are kicking off a project, make sure you take some time to understand the communication needs of your team and stakeholders. Some people dislike emails and would prefer to have a phone conversation, some prefer to have communication in writing, and some prefer face-to-face meetings. A strong communication system incorporates all of these methods. Set expectations for your communication approach early so that you, your team members, and your stakeholders have a clear understanding of how you will all communicate.

				 - **Lack of resources**
					 - Resources include your team members, budget, and materials. Unfortunately, without proper planning, your resources can quickly be over-tasked or depleted. Sometimes project managers don‚Äôt account for the fact that team members are juggling multiple tasks and may not be able to devote the time necessary to complete all of their assigned tasks correctly and on time. Or, project managers may not realize that a specific skill set is required to complete certain tasks. Ensuring that the right team members are available at the right time is crucial.

					 - Another common error is to incorrectly calculate your project expenses. For example, imagine you have a project budget of $10,000. If your project requires $10,000 for materials and you also have to ship and install those materials, then you will not have enough money to complete your project. Clarify your resource needs and confirm their availability with leadership up front to avoid delays or issues further along in the project.

				 - **Scope creep¬†**
					 - The scope provides an overarching framework of what is and is not included in the project‚Äôs work and deliverables. Defining the scope in the initiation phase helps identify the resources needed, the cost associated with those resources, and the schedule required to complete the work. Sometimes projects fail because the scope of the project grows and impacts to the scope are not captured.

					 - For example, imagine that you are given a project that originally includes three deliverables. During the course of the project, a stakeholder requests that two additional deliverables be included, but no changes are made to the schedule, budget, or team members to reflect the impact of the increased number of deliverables. As a project manager, when deliverables change, you have to make sure that you are capturing the potential** **impact of those changes to the schedule, budget, and quality. This is why it is so important to make sure that everything is documented in the initiation phase. Have a plan for how to handle scope creep if it occurs, and clarify who has the authority to approve scope changes.

				 - **Key takeaway¬†**
					 - Taking the time to clarify expectations‚Äîparticularly around communication methods, resources available, and scope‚Äîduring the initiation phase will increase the chances of your project‚Äôs success. Even if you follow these best practices, you may still encounter failure. Remember that in every failure, there is the opportunity to learn, grow, and do better the next time.

		 - Managing Resources
			 - Manage your resources carefully and early to set up your project for success
				 - Figuring out resources early on also helps you avoid accidentally understaffing your project, which can seriously slow down team progress and eat away at the overall timeline. Even worse, if you're not careful with your resource planning, you could wind up underestimating the budget, meaning you might not have enough money to purchase necessary materials, hire vendors, or support overtime requests

			 - Budget
				 - Common aspects of your project budget will include:
					 - Team: the cost of the people performing the work

					 - Services: any outside vendors helping your project

					 - Materials: any tangible items purchased to complete the project

				 - __Try to ask questions to uncover hidden costs__

			 - People

			 - Materials

		 - Project Documentation
			 - Documentation for project-kick-off
				 - Project Managers must keep track of all decisions made even if they weren't the ones to do them.
					 - Clear and consistent documentation ensures transparency and clear communication

				 - Documentation can help serve as references for future members of the team who join later.

				 - Documentation can also help us discover tasks, timelines, or costs that may have been unknown.

				 - Project proposal
					 - A document usually is written by leadership to persuade stakeholders to start a project.

					 - A formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details to reach its goals. A project charter helps you get organized, set up a framework for what needs to be done, and communicate those details to others.

				 - Project charter
					 - [Project charter template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HtFRAk4GAIEUdBZvct_Jr9RuWyGS8IlmqNiR0kA19y0/template/preview)

					 - The charter is the formal way that the project‚Äôs goals, values, benefits, and details are captured. You can think of the charter as the compass for your project since you will use it throughout the life cycle of the project. Many stakeholders will look to your [[Project Charter]] to ensure that you are indeed aligned with strategic goals and set up for achieving the desired end goal. Since the [[Project Charter]] carries so much importance, it is important to incorporate the right amount of detail while omitting miscellaneous elements.

					 - Developing the project charter in collaboration with both groups can help you make sure that your project charter addresses your key stakeholders‚Äô most important concerns and keeps your team aligned. Be sure to use the business case‚Äîthe reason for initiating the project‚Äîas the guiding direction to your project charter

					 - Project charters will vary but usually include some combination of the following key information:
						 - introduction/project summary

						 - goals/objectives

						 - business case/benefits and costs

						 - project team

						 - scope

						 - success criteria

						 - major requirements or key deliverables

						 - budget

						 - schedule/timeline or milestones

						 - constraints and assumptions

						 - risks

						 - OKRs

						 - approvals

		 - Tools to evaluate project needs
			 - Before you introduce a new tool to your team, you should be sure that this change is actually going to benefit the project, and ensure that those involved in your project understand the benefits of this change. Demonstrating to your teammates and stakeholders that you understand the tool and have evaluated its competency will help build trust, especially if this new tool is replacing an existing tool. Taking the time to introduce the new tool to your team members will also demonstrate that you have the best interest of the team in mind‚Äînot just the success of the project. 
				 - **Discuss the tool early and often, if possible. **The team should not feel blindsided by a new change. Make sure they know the change is coming as early as possible. This will help them prepare for an introduction or migration to the new tool.

				 - **Ask for feedback from key stakeholders. **You could get great feedback on features that you may have overlooked without asking for their expertise. You can solicit this feedback by requesting their input about functionality or have them list features in order of priority. The key is to create an opportunity for stakeholders to provide their feedback and allow you to incorporate their feedback into next steps.

				 - **Involve the key stakeholders in demonstrations as you get closer to making the final decision on the project tracking tool. **You will be able to leverage key stakeholders' acceptance by letting them test the product or sign up for a trial run. It is also important to make sure that the tool is actually going to meet the mark and provide a meaningful change for the project. You may want to pull in key users from your team to test and familiarize themselves with the tool prior to rolling it out. This will allow the team to get on board with your plans or discuss their concerns beforehand. This will also highlight in-house experts for future training, assistance, and implementation.

				 - **Ensure the tool is fully functional ****before**** the team is introduced to it.** Whenever possible, hold off from introducing the tool if it still has any issues. Make sure the tool is accessible for all users. Keep in mind, your team members may resist a tool that doesn‚Äôt live up to how it is supposed to function. This will impact implementation and acceptance fairly significantly, so put your best tool forward!

				 - **Set up training for the tool as needed ****before**** you ask the team to actually use it. **Everyone has different levels of comfort with different tools. It is your job as the project manager to ensure that each team members‚Äô needs are addressed. Setting up training also helps create positive first impressions, which will lead to higher productivity and quicker, more successful implementation and acceptance.
