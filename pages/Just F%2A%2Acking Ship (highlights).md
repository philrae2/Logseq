	- 1. Always Consider Your Guest ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr03kbw7yhpjb8ynrg2qkxq4))
	- when you’re building your thing, don’t just focus on *making* — focus also on asking the important questions:
	  
	  •   What do these people like?
	  •   What do they need?
	  •   What would be the worst fit for them?
	  •   What drives them crazy? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr03kmn8fxvptw2p64z9xe2c))
	- A direct implication of this is that the best products to start shipping are tightly focused ones. Don’t write a book titled ‘Everything You Need To Know About Consulting’; write a book titled ‘Double Your Freelancing Rate in 14 Days’.
	  
	  It’s much easier to write for a *specific* audience pain-point, and it takes far less time to complete. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr03k8ny42rwytthtnpv46c7))
	- 2. Set a Deadline … And Mean It ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr03ksj8x9kvj3494w9egv5d))
	- You’re probably not going to hit your deadline at first. You’re probably going to be a little bit late, or perhaps a whole lot late. But just setting a deadline and taking it seriously will force you to make significant progress ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr03m09hpfxmn77j1deq3kq1))
	- > Deadlines aren’t a flexing of arbitrary power. Deadlines are a tool to help you get what you want. A deadline you choose yourself isn’t a threat of punishment or failure — it’s a fun challenge to get excited about. Something to run towards and tackle. *To show you can do it.*
	  
	  With two caveats:
	  
	  1.  You must *really want* to finish the project you’ve set a deadline on.
	  2.  You should follow the rest of the techniques in the book, which will replace ‘The Pressure’ of deadlines with constant, measurable progress. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr03mf4j4xrx1w0hacxg1vs9))
	- 3. Work Backwards ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr03vd6zp6t73ryepmzxfxv6))
	- Similarly, for a project, you should start from the completed product, and then work backwards, asking:
	  
	  •   What’s the end result look like, exactly?
	  •   How many chapters/videos/features?
	  •   What is absolutely required, what’s nice to have?
	  •   How perfect does it have to be?
	  •   How long will each of these take?
	  •   What has to come first?
	  •   What do I need to prepare?
	  •   How long will that take?
	  •   What do I need to find out?
	  •   How long will that take?
	  •   How much, or how little, defines success? And who controls that?
	  
	  The rest of the techniques help you answer these question, which then slots into your backwards plan. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr03wggfcz8thvkshbd195nd))

	- 5. Get Crispy
	  
	  Get crispy means get specific, vivid, detailed. Crispy things have hard edges, and the hard edges are how you know you’re done.
	  
	  Hoy argues that when you’re outlining the work for your backwards plan, you should get crispy with *every stage* of the product:
	  
	  •   DON’T write a book “about consulting”. DO focus on a specific crispy problem: “Get Clients Now”.
	  •   DON’T call your app “user friendly”. DO explain that your new customer could “Log time with 4 key strokes”.
	  •   DON’T promise that “you’ll learn CSS.” DO offer, “How to use the new flexbox module to get exactly the layout you want.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5qkjwbr23mrvxjv2kw4tyq))
	- If you’re specific with every stage of your product — from product definition all the way down to specifications for each feature — you’ll find that you’ll be more likely to finish the product and ship. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5qknc4pbwrks1zj0etpaq0))
