	- Research is simply a continuation of something we already naturally do: learning. Learning happens when you understand something that __someone else already understands__. Research happens when you understand something that __nobody else understands yet__.
		- Research can happen because we are curious.  If you care enough about the question, you have to figure out how to answer it yourself, and that's when you start running experiments and developing hypotheses.
	- We should approach understanding not as "What new thing can I discover?" but what things are confusing to me or what things don't I understand?
