- The situation/context
	 - The 3542 enhancement is being deployed by August 20, 2021 with Integrity and other capability teams. We need to test the solutions before hand to make sure the solution works.

- What is the intended goal?
	 - The goal is to persuade the Orange Book Staff back into the Nexus environment.

- The problem statement or frame
	 - How can we design the tests for deploying the 3542 enhancement correctly.

- The variables that govern the situation include:
	 - Time constraints by Tim, the implementation team, and Integrity.

	 - Ability to find the right examples.

- The complications/complexities as I see them:
	 - Coordination between Implementation and Integrity and the necessary time.

	 - Last minute unknows suddenly showing up. 

- Alternatives that were seriously considered and not chosen were:

- Explain the range of outcomes:
	 - Deploy with untested scenarios, test as we go on, test in preprod and see what outcomes are in production environment

	 - Don't deploy?

	 - Deploy and finish testing scenarios

- What I expect to happen and the actual probabilities are:
	 - Deploy with untested scenarios due to time constraints

- What are second or third order results
	 - Consider hypercare training? - once weekly? or more?

	 - More revisions

- ^^What is the approach to the solution:^^
	 - Prioritize the test scenarios to must have in order for the Orange Book staff to return to Nexus
		 - Ask Tim what are the expectations for him in August and the testing cases to align to those needs
			 - 100% Project Creation
				 - Scanned 3542 form vs 3542a project creation

				 - Mistitled

				 - Untitled 

			 - Ability to close pharmacist queue and data entry queue

			 - Clear preprod and prod environments

- The outcome:
