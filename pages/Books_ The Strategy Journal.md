		- Step 1 - Planning #[[Decision Tree]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2Fw-OtiqGPgp.57.08%20PM.png?alt=media&token=e64d51f9-7591-4fe6-9a06-b8ee3692df55)
			- The planning stage happens before any research or study starts. This phase relies on existing knowledge of the business, the client, and the market sector. You don't need to do research to start this phase.
			- The [[problem statement]] is the most critical portion of the planning phase.
				- You can have the best analyses but it will not solve the problem if stated the problem statement incorrectly.
				- Keep rewriting and revising the problem statements to reach a narrow scope of the problem.
					- Include metrics that measure success
					- The numeric target you are wanting to achieve
					- The timeframe to complete or solve the problem
					- The scope of the products
					- Sectors/regions covered
			- The [[option tree]] is the process of listing all the options to fix the problems.
				- This phase employs the concept of Mutually Exclusive/Collectively Exhaustive [[MECE]]
					- Collectively exhaustive means you have listed all the options to fix a branch of the decision tree.
					- Mutually exclusive means one option can be implemented while keeping others unchanged.
				- Build out the decision tree at least 3 to 5 levels deep.
				- Prioritize the branches that has the highest rate for a successful solution to the problem with the fastest time for completion.
		- Step 2 - Develop Your Hypotheses #[[q: How do we implement second-order thinking in work?]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- Create a hypothesis for each of the prioritized branch from the decision tree. Don't create or test unprioritized branches of the decision tree.
			- A hypothesis allows us to test our understanding of the option that we think will fix the problem and consequences after.
			- A hypothesis should have 3 parts: (to support [[Second-Order Thinking]])
				- Due to x
				- y happens
				- which leads to z
			- Example:
				- Priority branch # 1 - Do we need to improve our distribution?
					- Hypothesis: Due to the lack of a functioning ecommerce site, Genie Diapers is wholly dependent on retail stores, which leads to lower sales among millenials.
				- Priority branch # 2 - Can we improve the product to take share?
					- Due to a lack of waterproof tape fasteners, customers prefer more expensive competitors, which leas to a loss of value and volume of share.
		- Step 3 - Design your analyses to test the hypotheses
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FEZIhtp09pD.23.20%20PM.png?alt=media&token=51f2b028-0edb-4e47-80da-3bce85495bc2)
			- Think of how you will design the test to find if your hypothesis is true. Sketch out the exhibit you would plot, with the data you would collect.
				- You can test a hypothesis with 1, 2, or even 3 tests. Each test is presented on its own slide.
				- Use different charts for each hypothesis, from bar to pie to rankings of frequency.
				- The work in this section should be completed in a day or two, at most. Strategy studies are fast-paced and focused, but trust the process.
		- Step 4 - Build, Refine and Test your preliminary storyboard
		  collapsed:: true
			- Determine if an analysis worth the effort to find the data before finding the data.
			- Story boards help us understand if the analyses are worth the effort.
				- When we finish the storyboard we can then ask if it is compelling and worth while for the client to implementâ€”is it worth doing at all?
				- Share the initial story board to your clients and team for continued refinement. Keep editing the headlines until the headline by itself allows you to understand what is in the slide without reading the slide itself.
			- The headlines from the storyboard is complete when taken all together they complete a compelling story.
			- The questions you ask yourself at the end will determine if this is worth the effort. If it is not, either we aren't finding the benefits or the problems weren't as bad as we thought.

		- Step 5  - Finish your storyboard aka analysis plan
		  collapsed:: true
			- The steps to a preliminary board came about from:
				- problem statement
				- decision tree of options
				- prioritized options
				- hypothesis for prioritized options
				- tests for hypotheses
				- slides for each test
				- refined headlines for each slide
				- preliminary storyboard (and analyses plan)
					- through the rearrangement of the headlines
			- The storyboard outlines our activities to do on the study.
			- We now know all the primary analyses we w ill need to complete over the duration of the study and can now plan our time, resources, etc.
			- We can start the analyses now that we have the analytic work plan completed (storyboard)
				- Because all this work remains only highly educated and well-structured guesses, the next step is to see if the problem statement and storyboard capture the real issues of the client.

		- Step 6 - Develop the charter
		  collapsed:: true
			- The [[Project Charter]] is a "contract" with your clients and team. Use the document to manage scope creep and guide the client and team.

			- All project follow the same analytical approach and because of the differences of data, interpretation of information, analyses and recommend solutions will all result in a unique option.
			- Always being with the [[focus interview]], which help you inform the client what employees, suppliers, and/or stakeholders think about the issue being fixed, the reason the issue exists, and what can be done to solve the problem.
