	 - Title of book

	 - __Die Zettelkastenmethode: Kontrolliere dein Wissen__

	 - (__The Zettelkasten Method: Take Control of Your Knowledge__)

	 - Author(s)

	 - Sascha Fast

	 - Please summarize the book in a tweet (140 characters or so)

	 - The Zettelkasten Method: build a "second memory" to know what you know and boost productivity.

	 - Top 3 takeaways
		 - "Second memory": a structured system for developing and accessing personal knowledge

		 - Quick retrieval of relevant material from the accumulated knowledge base enables extraordinary productivity in writing

		 - Interlinked notes and shared keywords yield emergent structures: the user "communicates" with the Zettelkasten and is often "surprised" by it

	 - Who is the intended audience?

	 - "Knowledge workers", particularly but not limited to academics and non-fiction writers

	 - Overall quality/satisfaction level (1-10, 10 being highest)

	 - 8

	 - Difficulty/complexity level (1-10)

	 - 4

	 - Top 3 positive points
		 - Clearly structured system, easy to follow once set up

		 - Enables "surprises": emergent structures as connections develop over time

		 - Potential to significantly improve writing productivity

	 - Top 3 negative points
		 - Somewhat dated; ideas and tools have developed since the book was originally written. (A new edition is planned, tentatively for later this year.)

		 - Implicit assumption that all knowledge should be distilled into Zettels; it is acknowledged that writing Zettels takes considerable time and effort but the opportunity cost is not addressed.

		 - The book is a little thin and could be more thorough in explaining the concepts. I'm not sure I'd have a complete grasp of the concepts from reading the book alone; I've picked up a lot from also following the authors' blog and community discussions.

	 - [Note: aÂ __ZettelÂ __is a slip of paper; aÂ __ZettelkastenÂ __is a "slip box". Since that phrase doesn't mean much in English, the German word tends to be used in discussions in English among the small community of the method's adherents. Luhmann's Zettelkasten resembled a pre-digital-age library card catalog. The actual slips were roughly the size of index cards but on thinner stock; a lifetime collection of notes on card stock would have taken up significantly more space.]

	 - The Zettelkasten Method is a knowledge management and writing support system developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann in the 20th century and updated for the digital age by Sascha Fast and Christian Tietze. The Zettelkasten note archive is a lifelong asset that grows in size and sophistication over time. By serving as a "second memory" and delivering "surprising" connections, sometimes decades after the notes were originally written, the Zettelkasten enables extraordinary productivity in the writing of books, articles, and other texts.

	 - The modern Zettelkasten consists of:

	 - * The archive: a collection of interlinked plain-text notes (Zettels)

	 - * An inbox to hold materials that have not yet been processed and distilled into Zettels

	 - * A bibliography database containing information on external source documents used in producing the Zettel notes

	 - A Zettel note consists of:

	 - * A header containing:

	 - - The unique note ID, based on a digits-only timestamp of its creation

	 - - A title

	 - - A list of keywords prefixed with the symbol 'Â§'. (The 'Â§' symbol can also be used to mark keywords within the body text.)

	 - * A title that concisely and accurately describes the note's content

	 - * Content: one idea per note, about 250 words, derived from research reading material or your own ideas, in your own words, in clear, concise sentences

	 - * Links to related Zettels, consisting of the linked Zettel's ID prefixed with the 'Â§' symbol

	 - * References to the source texts

	 - Material is gathered into the Zettelkasten in two steps:

	 - 1. Collecting, reading, taking notes and other actions needed to understand the source materials

	 - 2. Distilling that understanding into Zettel notes and interlinking those notes

	 - Writing using the Zettelkasten consists of three steps:

	 - 1. Start an outline on the topic you're writing about.

	 - 2. Browse the Zettelkasten, following trails of keywords and links, adding the titles of relevant Zettels to the outline and organizing the outline as you go. The outline will serve as a table of contents for your text.

	 - 3. When you've gathered enough material, copy the outline and replace the Zettel titles it contains with the content of the corresponding Zettels. This yields a first draft of the complete document.

	 - **Introduction**Â pp. 3â€“4

	 - The Zettelkasten Method opens a new entry into the world of knowledge work.

	 - Based on the practices of 20th century sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who wrote over 80 books and 400 articles without the help of assistants.Â When Luhmann was asked how he managed to write so many books and articles, he said he had this box that took over the work of writing books for him.

	 - The Zettelkasten is a tool for managing unmanageable piles of information. Precisely this is the challenge of the floods of information available in the modern age.

	 - **Why use a Zettelkasten?****Â **pp. 7â€“22

	 - The actualÂ **purpose of a Zettelkasten is to help you produce texts**.Â This doesn't mean it can't accomplish much more.

	 - In my experience, using a Zettelkasten enlarges my active knowledge, expands my capacity for lateral thinking, and has improved my work with texts and ideas.

	 - The Zettelkasten as we know it is aÂ __**lifelong strategy**Â __designed to encompass the totality of your knowledge.

	 - The Zettlekasten is a machine that, through you as its user,Â thinks on its own, surprises you with new ideas, and smooths out our unsteady human way of thinking without constraining it.

	 - It took Christian and me just two hours to produce the first draft of this book. It encompasses information and learning process that took place between 2009 and 2014. I did not have to work systematically on theÂ **manuscript; it emerged on its own through my engagement with the Zettelkasten method**.

	 - The Zettelkasten method is a comprehensive approach combining learning, organizing, and writing into a single process.

	 - **You get aÂ ****second memory**

	 - The Zettelkasten takes over several steps of the process of recall that you would otherwise have to perform in your head. When we try to remember something, we follow a trail of linkages in our thoughts. The Zettelkasten performs this linking function.

	 - Notably, Luhmann wrote aboutÂ __communicatingÂ __with his Zettelkasten. Once you have built your Zettelkasten up to a certain size, it will supply you withÂ __new connectionsÂ __and idea triggers.

	 - **It improves your thinking**

	 - The Zettelkasten method encourages an interdisciplinary attitude and a good overview.

	 - It dissolves the boundaries between disciplines.

	 - I have avoided taking on many smaller projects because I didn't want to be distracted from my main projects. But it's enough to invest a little bit of time every day for a new project.

	 - Using the Zettelkasten, I can now start a project whenever I get the urge. It's not a problem if I then let it lie untouched for a while. The ZettelkastenÂ acts as a buffer for this inconsistency of effort.

	 - A further aspect is that, at the time of learning something new, it's not always possible to determine whether the information is useful or not. There are notes in my archive that lay fallow until I stumbled over them through some random connection. Only then did their value become apparent in connection with my newer thinking.

	 - Thoughts and ideas undergo a selection process only when I query my Zettelkasten. At first they simply enter the Zettelkasten without appraisal. The Zettelkasten keeps me from discarding things through shortsightedness or impatience.

	 - The ZettelkastenÂ forces me to write, which makes my thinking more orderly:
		 - You learn more when you're active.

		 - Writing makes gaps explicit.

		 - Writing furnishes a view of the quality of various perspectives through comparison.

		 - Writing puts thoughts in order.

	 - **Work is more structured**

	 - The Zettelkasten method provides an adaptable framework based on best practices in knowledge work.

	 - This reduces the need to make decisions during the work process.

	 - You:
		 - become more productive with the same amount of energy

		 - accomplish more with the same effort

	 - **Your writing gets better**

	 - Working with the Zettelkasten keeps you constantly writing.

	 - The Zettelkasten forces you to write in such a way that even very short passages are understandable and self-contained.Â After all, when reading in your Zettelkasten, you shouldn't have to be constantly asking what you meant by that.

	 - **You read better**

	 - When you know that you'll have to produce Zettels from what you're reading, your reading behavior changes automatically.

	 - An advantage of reading for the purpose of producing Zettels is that you're looking for systematic facts and connections.

	 - One inferior alternative is to highlight onlyÂ __interestingÂ __passages. Few people take proper notes. But it's not whether a passage is interesting that makes it valuable for your work, but whether it's useful and delivers truths.

	 - **Your mind is freed**

	 - You no longer have to revisit texts repeatedly. Many knowledge workers mark up texts with various memory aids, but they still have to exercise memory even when the text is in front of them.Â Ideally,Â **once you've thoroughly processed a document, you'll never have to pick it up again**. Instead, you can look up the subject or author in your ZettelkastenÂ for immediate access to everything you've read and written about it.

	 - You also have immediate access to your own ideas.Â The Zettelkasten takes away the fear that you'll forget a good idea.

	 - The Zettelkasten provides an overview because the process maintains the structure of your work.

	 - The Zettelkasten enables you to take one step at a time.

	 - Working with a Zettelkasten reduces your cognitive load by reducing the Zeigarnik ratio, i.e. the ratio of unfinished to finished tasks.

	 - More intermediate tasks automatically produce milestones.

	 - **Notes acquire long-term meaning**

	 - If you have to write down notes anyway (for various purposes), you might as well do it in a way that yields long-term value. The Zettelkasten is an opportunity to give long-term meaning to your short-term tasks.

	 - Reading Luhmann's works one is struck by the enormous range of his sources.

	 - The Zettelkasten is useful for all knowledge workers, not just scholars.

	 - **Components of the ZettelkastenÂ **pp. 23â€“49

	 - Plain text: the most robust technical solution; easiest way to store your knowledge without risk of obsolescence.

	 - So don't be surprised that I'm going all the way without taking advantage of various program functions. These simply make things easier that would still be possible simply by using your operating system and the capacity to read text files.

	 - ****The Archive**â€”the heart of the Zettelkasten**

	 - There isÂ only one archive, only one folder.

	 - The Zettelkasten methodÂ avoids setting up categories in advance because they are inflexible. Instead of a fixed structure, keywords in the archive produce aÂ __potentialÂ __structure. New structures spontaneously emerges again and again.

	 - __Anatomy of a Zettel__
		 - Header

		 - ID

		 - Content

		 - Keywords

		 - Links

		 - References

	 - TheÂ __headerÂ __contains metadata:
		 - ID

		 - Title

		 - Keywords (tags)

		 - Date (implicit in the ID)

	 - When you rummage through your Zettelkasten (communicate with it, as Luhmann would say), you want to have done as much work as possible ahead of time. If a state of disorder were to lead to confusion in your search (or entertainment), you would stop working with the Zettelkasten as such and it would become nothing more than a filing system.

	 - Examples of metadataÂ __notÂ __to include in the header:
		 - Date

		 - Author

		 - Category

		 - Project assignment

	 - These are superfluous, even harmful, because:
		 - The date is already contained in the ID (see below)

		 - Authors are cited in the footnotes and can be found via full-text search

		 - Keywords are a superior approach to categories

		 - Notes can be assigned to projects via outlining (see below)

	 - TheÂ ____ID__Â __is the unique identifier for each Zettel. ItÂ __never changes__, thus providing a fixed address for each note. The key aspects here areÂ __uniquenessÂ __and theÂ __capacity for linking__.

	 - Luhmann assigned IDs to his slips in the form of sequential numbers. When picking up a thread later from a given note he would use letters and further numbers to create branching sequences. For example, Zettel 23a might start a new sequence following Zettel 23, in turn followed by Zettel 23a1.

	 - The Zettelkasten grows by following the threads of your thinking and is not tied to a predefined system of categories that may later prove limiting.

	 - With modern technology, there is no need to follow Luhmann's procedure for assigning IDs. Instead we use aÂ timestampÂ made up of the following components:
		 - Year

		 - Month

		 - Day

		 - Hour

		 - Minute

	 - The ID string consists only of numbers, e.g.Â 201502240906.

	 - Advantages:
		 - No special characters that could potentially create problems

		 - Always the same length

		 - Notes are automatically sorted by date

		 - Very easy to create

	 - __**Keywords**Â __are prefixed with the Â§ symbol. They replace a system of categories, gathering notes into groups without the need to create explicit links. It becomes possible to move Â through the archive from keyword to keyword. Once the Zettelkasten reaches a certain size, this leads to many unconventional linkages.

	 - We have taken the approach of writing the keywords into the text itself rather than using operating system file metadata or application keyword functions, which could lead to data loss if you ever change applications or operating systems.

	 - __Content__

	 - For the Zettelkasten method to function, it is important toÂ write in your own words, not simply copy other people's texts. If you simply copy texts into your archive as Zettels, instead of encountering knowledge, ideas, memories, and thoughts in your Zettelkasten, you will instead encounter texts that you have to assimilate all over again.

	 - SimplyÂ __havingÂ __an external text is insufficient. You have toÂ __understandÂ __it and fix this understanding in your own words.

	 - A further specific benefit of the Zettelkasten method is that it forces you to write and think.

	 - **Links**

	 - By including the address of a Zettel, you indicate its relevance in another one.

	 - Links combine notes into a fabric of meaning. This fabric is what gives the archive itsÂ __power/cardinality__. When links can themselves be linked, the cardinality grows rapidly with the number of links, much faster than simply by filling the archive with notes. At this point it isÂ not only the contents of the notes that are significant; the links themselves bear meaning.

	 - In mathematics, cardinality is a means of extending the concept of "number of elements in a set" to infinite sets. The number of notes is finite, but the number of potential links is infinite.

	 - To create a link, simply copy the ID of the Zettel you're linking to, prefixed with the symbol 'Â§', to the point in another Zettel where you want to refer to it.Â A further advantage is that searching for a Zettel ID prefixed with Â§ will brink up all other Zettels that link to it.

	 - __References__

	 - A reference is the connection between your archive and the outside world. A reference indicatesÂ which text was the source of the idea you've written. A search for a reference key will bring up all notes you've written on a given text.

	 - The reference key consists of the first author's last name and the year of publication of the text and is theÂ same as the citekey in BibTex.

	 - __Inbox__

	 - TheÂ __inboxÂ __is a centralÂ collection point for all material that has not yet been processed for the archiveÂ but is intended to end up there eventually. Examples:
		 - Articles and books to process. Reading and working through a text is much quicker than generating Zettels from them. This means you need a place to keep them until they've been processed into Zettels.

		 - Handwritten notes

		 - Electronic notes. For example, if I write a post in an Internet forum, I automatically store it as a Zettel

		 - E-mails

	 - It is very important first to captureÂ __allÂ __your input streams in an inbox.

	 - Advantages of having an inbox system:
		 - Structure

		 - Bundling: defines a specific category of task, allowing you to work efficiently in a focused session

		 - Buffering: immediately writing Zettels as you go would slow down your workflow

		 - Mental relief: if you use the Zettelkasten method systematically, inboxes also become your mental buffer

	 - __Bibliography management__

	 - The bibliography management system is the interface between your Zettelkasten and the texts that the Zettels refer to.

	 - An entry stores the following information:
		 - Citekey

		 - Complete bibliographical data

		 - Link to the full text, if available

	 - It is an explicit aim to have to read any text only once. Upon completion you should have written down everything relevant you found there.

	 - The bibliography management system is essentially a list of books, articles, and websites. It is a technical aid and has no content value.

	 - **Setting up your Zettelkasten**

	 - Keep yourÂ __deskÂ __as neat as possible.

	 - Have aÂ __notepad and penÂ __handy.

	 - Have a place to keep books you've read. When you've finished reading a book, it goes on the stack until you've had a chance to process it into Zettels. Have similar places to keep texts in other formats, both hard-copy and electronic.

	 - **The Two-Step Cycle**Â pp. 51â€“88

	 - Working with a Zettelkasten consists of two steps:
		 - Collecting: everything done to structure informationÂ __outsideÂ __the Zettelkasten

		 - Writing Zettels: everything done to structure informationÂ __insideÂ __the Zettelkasten

	 - **Step One: Collecting**
		 - All of the work involved inÂ __understandingÂ __an idea so it can be incorporated into the Zettelkasten

		 - Filling your Zettelkasten-specific inboxes

	 - Steps that occurÂ __beforeÂ __a Zettel is actually created:
		 - Reading for "zettelability"

		 - Preparing texts for Zettel generation and proper preparation of notes

		 - Properly placing items in the Zettelkasten inbox

	 - Three sources of material for Zettels:
		 - Your own thoughts

		 - Other people's thoughts

		 - Your own thoughtsÂ __triggered byÂ __other people's

	 - Six types of Zettelkasten content that can be derived from reading:
		 - Theories

		 - Models

		 - Terms (definitions)

		 - Arguments: these consist of a conclusion and one or more reasons supporting it

		 - Counter-arguments

		 - Facts

	 - Reading for the Zettelkasten consists of searching for theories, models, terms, arguments, counter-arguments, and facts in texts and in your own thoughts.

	 - Don't try to be "fair" to an author, unless the author's opinion is your primary reason for reading a document. Instead, try to read for your own purposes.

	 - When reading for the Zettelkasten, have a pen or pencil in your hand.

	 - Ways of marking a text:
		 - Underlining, highlighting, lines in the margin

		 - Functional marginalia

		 - Margin notes

		 - Notes on separate paper (or digital files)

	 - Pencil is recommended:
		 - Can be erased

		 - Unlike a highlighter, it can also be used to write notes without changing instruments

		 - Marks in the margin are quicker than underlining

	 - __Functional marginaliaÂ __are small abbreviations indicating the significance of a passage. Examples:
		 - A: Argument

		 - D: Distinction

		 - T: Term

		 - M: Model

		 - F: Fact

		 - P: Problem/issue

	 - If you decide to use these marginalia, develop your own system of abbreviations.

	 - __Margin notesÂ __provide more information about the content when you return to a text to write Zettels. Examples: cross-references to other authors, references to other key theories and models.

	 - __NotesÂ __require the most effort but are also the most powerful tool for processing a text. They are worth the time investment when you're dealing with complex ideas or important references for understanding a difficult text passage. A simple definition, by contrast, only requires marking the text.Â As a rule of thumb, the more complex the idea and the more it deviates from what is written in the source document, the more effort you should make to capture it.

	 - **Typical collection failures**

	 - __Messie Syndrome I:Â __simply copying text.Â __OnlyÂ __processed texts and your own notes, never unprocessed texts, should go in your Zettelkasten inbox.

	 - __Messie Syndrome II:Â __allowing material to linger in the inbox. TheÂ actual writing of Zettels is the greatest bottleneckÂ in the entire process.

	 - __Collecting mere assertions:Â __just because someone said it, no matter how famous or established a figure, that doesn't mean it's important or relevant. f you collect everything you come across, your Zettelkasten will become a mere catalog of other people's assertions rather than a living second memory.

	 - __Sloppy processing:Â __the risk is that you found a passage highly relevant while reading, but by the time you return to the text to generate Zettels you've forgotten just why you marked it. This should be avoided.Â During the reading and processing phase, you should prepare the text so thoroughly that you could still produce a meaningful Zettel from it ten years later.

	 - **Step Two: Writing Zettels**

	 - Producing ZettelsÂ from texts and from your own notes isÂ by far the most time-consuming step. Fortunately it is also the step that delivers the most impact for your writing and thinking.

	 - Why is it so time-consuming?
		 - You can read anywhere; you can only produce Zettels at the computer.

		 - Reading is relatively simple; writing Zettels is complicated.

		 - Writing Zettels reveals that not all of your thoughts are capable of being put into writing. You'll notice that certain notes were written when you were in the grip of a certainÂ __feeling__. When the feeling dissipates, it becomes apparent that the thought was anything but clear. It's easy to quickly jot down a note, but a Zettel should be written with much more care.

	 - Over time, working with the Zettelkasten can be divided into two phases. During the first phase, the archive is more-or-less empty; the Zettelkasten must be fed.Â During the second phase, interlinking gradually becomes more important. Eventually you will have enough Zettels that they constantly surprise you. These surprises will reveal new connections you had never thought of before.

	 - **Writing a Zettel**

	 - A Zettel need not be perfect. What matters is that your later self can easily understand it.

	 - A Zettel is like a blog post:
		 - It should quickly capture your attention

		 - Put the most important thing first

		 - Use the simplest possible language.

	 - The aim is toÂ make information retrievable at a glanceÂ and inject it into your brain in the most quickly digestible form.

	 - __Give it a good title:Â __theÂ title should relate directly to the content. When you've finished writing a Zettel, check the title again to confirm that it refers directly to the actual content.

	 - __TheÂ ____first sentence should be a summary____.Â __If you can't express the content of a Zettel in one sentence, it is either a bad Zettel or much too long and should be split up. Later when browsing your Zettelkasten, it becomes a hugeÂ timesaverÂ to be able toÂ grasp a Zettel by readingÂ the title and first sentenceÂ without having to determine if it's necessary to read the rest of each one. When browsing through hundreds of slips, seconds add up.

	 - __Clear content:Â __write concisely but be complete. Each Zettel must be understandable on its own, even if it means repeating something that's also contained in other Zettels.

	 - In my [__Fast's__] opinion, you should limit the length of a Zettel to 250 words. The fundamental rule isÂ **one idea per Zettel**; thisÂ ____generally__Â __comes toÂ no more than 250 words.

	 - __AssignÂ ____keywords____:Â __be liberal in assigning keywords. Keywords create random connections, making them particularly surprising. These surprises are what lead to new ideas when working with a Zettelkasten.

	 - Use every synonym you can think of. Over time the most important keywords will start to emerge on their own.

	 - Guidelines for assigning keywords:
		 - Try to use nouns only

		 - Choose positive keywords, e.g. Â§sympathy rather than Â§antipathy

		 - If certain keywords seem far-fetched, use them anyway.

	 - Keywords can be placed in the header or marked with the 'Â§' symbol in the body text itself.

	 - __Indicate theÂ __reference:Â ____copy the bibliographical citation into the ZettelÂ even though it's also in your bibliographic database:
		 - This makes the system more resistant to malfunctions

		 - If you use Markdown conventions, this makes it easier to incorporate your Zettels into a manuscript when using the Zettelkasten to write a document.

	 - __Link your Zettels__

	 - The more Zettels you have, the more important it becomes to createÂ **links**Â between them.Â Like breadcrumbs, these links will show you the path through your archive.

	 - There are two types of connections: implicit connections via shared keywords, and explicit linking directly to another Zettel.

	 - A link consists of two elements: the ID of the linked Zettel, and the referring text.Â Since ten years may pass before you run across a reference again, always write why you've placed the link.

	 - Examples:

	 - A group of Zettels may form a set, with one Zettel representing the set as a whole (e.g. a summary or table of contents) while the others represents elements of the set.

	 - Two Zettels may be related within the context of an argument, with one supporting a conclusion in the other or representing a counter-argument to the other. The links in this case should be reciprocal and clear: don't simply write "see also Zettel X" but rather "A counter-argument casts doubt on the premise: see Zettel X."

	 - In an ontological relationship, one Zettel may contain an element of the model in a different Zettel. Terminology systems function similarly.

	 - As a rule of thumb,Â any time the content of one Zettel expands, makes use of, or explains that of another Zettel, create a link between them.

	 - __Types of ZettelsÂ __(not an exhaustive list):
		 - How-to tutorial

		 - Overview/summary

		 - List of experimental findings

		 - List of sources

		 - Links â€” most are simply connections between two Zettels, but occasionally the link itself is worthy of a Zettel of its own.

		 - Own thoughts

		 - Argumentation (pros and cons)

		 - Book review

		 - Speculation

		 - Questions

		 - Things learned

		 - Summary of a conversation (with a reference to the interlocutor, to give proper credit)

		 - Edits â€” you may identify recurring patterns when making corrections; these may be worth capturing in a Zettel.

		 - Problem â€” conflicts, differences of opinion

	 - **Short cycle vs. long cycle**

	 - Both cycles consist of:
		 - Research

		 - Reading & processing

		 - Writing Zettels

	 - The idea behind theÂ **short cycle**Â is to start reading and writing Zettels as soon as possible. This keeps undigested texts from piling up, waiting to be processed into Zettels.
		 - Start withÂ __one hour of research__**Â **or less. Tie down any loose ends by making note of where you stopped so you can return to that point later.

		 - Read everything you've found and process it completely.

		 - Write Zettels from the documents you've processed.

		 - Review your process:
			 - How well did things go?

			 - How long did it take you to process the documents and write Zettels?

			 - Next time, would you schedule more or less time for research?

		 - Capture the results in writing.

		 - Adjust the cycle.

	 - TheÂ ****long cycle**Â **entailsÂ scheduling large blocks of timeÂ for the step that is your bottleneck.

	 - Personally I [__Fast__] know I'm most productive and creative in the morning, so I've set that time aside for writing. In the afternoon I set aside 1â€“2 hours for producing Zettels. Benefits:
		 - Because writing Zettels is more of an interpretive process, it's something I can also do in the afternoon.

		 - Writing Zettels often awakens creative energy; as a result I also get a few new thoughts and ideas in the afternoon.

	 - __The right cycle for the right job__
		 - In the short cycle you limit the initiating step, the research, to avoid large pile-ups of undigested texts.

		 - In the long cycle you set fixed times for each step, making sure you have sufficient material for each step.

	 - Try each cycle for 4â€“6 weeks to determine which one makes you more productive. In general, the longer the texts you're reading, the longer the cycle you should use.

	 - **Writing with the Zettelkasten**Â pp. 89â€“98

	 - Phases of writing:
		 - The idea

		 - Collecting

		 - Revising

	 - The Zettelkasten is important in the first and especially the second step. When working with a Zettelkasten, you are continually writing small texts. These could the fragments of a longer text such as an article or book. Writing with a Zettelkasten means channeling this constant production of text fragments without having to maintain a constant overview.

	 - A goodÂ __outlineÂ __will later become a table of contents for your text.

	 - **If you have an idea but have not yet written anything**

	 - **Step one:****Â **Create a text file containing anÂ outlineÂ as a structured list.

	 - **Step two:****Â **Research relevant materials. When to start producing Zettels depends on whether you're using a long or short cycle.Â Add [the title of] every Zettel you produce to your outline.Â Once the list has reached a certain length, you should start forming clusters by subject.

	 - **Step three:Â **Replace the Zettel titles with the contents of the Zettels.Â This yields a rough first draft.

	 - **If you have an idea and have already written something**

	 - The aim is to close the gaps in your thinking so far. Working with a Zettelkasten can help turn your unclear idea into a clear, structured outline.

	 - If you have been carefully interlinking your Zettels, you will find not just unsorted notes, but Zettels that are relevant to your topic. You will find text suggestions resulting from the direction in which you choose to follow your own links.

	 - Again, you're pursuing the two final steps:
		 - Research and write Zettels until your outline is promisingly dense

		 - Replace the Zettel titles with their content

	 - **You have an idea but no topic**

	 - I've made a rule of adding every Zettel to at least one outline. That's not possible 100% of the time, but it ensures that I'm constantly producing rough drafts of new texts. It allows you to work on multiple writing projects at the same time without taking attention away from your main project.

	 - **Buffer outlines****Â for every purpose**

	 - Create a "Buffer" folder. The outlines it will hold doÂ __notÂ __belong in your archive because they do not add value to your work within the archive. It contains outlines in the form of text files on topics and texts that you'reÂ __notÂ __focusing on.

	 - By gradually adding material to these outlines, in a year or two I may find I've finished a book without ever deliberately pursuing the intention of writing one.

	 - I also have buffer files for current writing projects [i.e. documents I've already started writing in manuscript form, not just as Zettels and outlines]. If I write a Zettel that is relevant for a given book, I don't add it directly to the manuscript but rather to the buffer outline. Then later I look through all the Zettels in the buffer and add new material to the book.

	 - **"Back-Zetteling"**

	 - In the course of writing, I may have an idea but don't want to interrupt my workflow to add it to my Zettelkasten. Later I pick these up byÂ using my own texts as sources for producing Zettels. The nice thing about this process is that I can simply copy extended passages of the writing.

	 - **Productivity tips**Â pp. 99â€“112
		 - Remove everything that pulls you away from your desk

		 - Add anything that helps you type meaningful words

	 - Requirements for productivity:
		 - Time

		 - Place

		 - Focus

	 - Productive people work according to a schedule.

	 - It is important to have a reasonable place to work:
		 - Free of distractions

		 - Free of interruptions

		 - Comfortable and cozy

		 - Quick and easy to get to

	 - Straighten up your work space and keep it neat.

	 - __Don't get stuck in one place.Â __Do not become dependent on one writing location. If you become convinced that you canÂ __onlyÂ __write in this one place, you will become inflexible. Instead, if you find that you can write particularly well in a certain place, ask yourself why that is and try to apply the factors you identify in other locations as well.

	 - Why are distractions and interruptions such a problem?Â __Decision fatigue.Â __The more often you have to make a decision not to purse a distraction, theÂ __lessÂ __likely it becomes that you'll decide against it the next time. Decision fatigue also has an impact on your actual writing decisions and can make your texts less orderly and your style weaker.

	 - To avoid distractions and interruptions:
		 - Wear earplugs or earphones

		 - Listen to instrumental music or nature sounds

		 - Work behind closed doors

		 - Make yourself aware that you have committed to doing something

		 - Turn off all alerts

		 - Clean up your work space

		 - Work offline

		 - Work somewhere that other people can't access

		 - Talk about your work hours, i.e. make sure others know when you should not be disturbed

		 - Turn off your phone

		 - Hang a "Do not disturb" sign on your door

		 - Keep your eyes on the ball

		 - Never lift your fingers from the keyboard

	 - __Avoid transitional activities__Â during breaks or between tasks, such as social media or watching videos. These activities raise the amplitude of the focus-relaxation cycle. Returning from relaxation and being in a scattered state to work more takes mental energy, as does switching between different work modes. Instead, move your body. Get up and step away from your desk. If you need ideas, search for "Zwischenroutine" at the website me-improved.de [__presumably only in German â€” I haven't checked â€“MLG__].
