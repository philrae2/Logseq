- Chapter 1 - Are people stupid

- When taking in percentages 
	 - "always ask for the reference class: Percent of what?"

	 - "What is the absolute risk increase"

- Less is more
	 - When we face a complex problem, we look for a complex solution, and when it doesn't work we seen an even more complex one.
		 - Complex problems do not always need a complex solution. Overly complicated systems are difficult to comprehend, easy to exploit, and possibly dangerous. They do not increase the trust of the people. 
			 - Simple rules, in contrast, can make us smart and create a safer world.

- savvy means acute, astute and wise, but it means more than being informed. It requires courage to face an uncertain future as well as to stand up to authority and ask critical questions.

- Chapter 2 - Certainty is an illusion
	 - Humans appear to have a need for certainty, a motivation to hold on to something rather than question it. 

	 - The quest for certainty is the biggest obstacle to become risk savvy. False certainty can do tremendous damage.

		 - In an uncertain world, complex decision making methods involving more information and calculation are often worse and can cause damage by invoking unwarranted certainty

		 - ^^Popular thinking states that when making decisions, rules of thumb (heuristics) are always second best. Yet that is only true in a world of known risk, not in an uncertain world^^
			 - risk does not equal uncertainty. The best decision under risk is not the best decision under uncertainty

			 - rules of thumb are not dumb

			 - less is more

	 - When making decisions, the two sets of mental tools are reuqired:
		 - [[risk]] - if risks are known, good decisions require logic and statistical thinking

		 - [[uncertainty]] - if some risks are unknown, good decisions also require intuition and smart rules of thumb

	 - there are three facets of probability:
		 - [[frequency]]

		 - [[physical design]] - example is the design of die, or the software inside the slot machine calculating the probability of a pay out or [[propensity]]
			 - propensity is probabilities by design

		 - [[degrees of belief]] - a degree of belief can be based on anything from experience to personal impression, they can be subjective and variable, however they can be applied to any and every problem. 

	 - ^^Communicating [[risk]]s:^^
		 - ^^use frequencies instead of single-event probabilities^^

		 - ^^use [[absolute risk]] instead of relative risk^^

	 - heuristic thinking may produce better, faster, and safer decisions by ignoring information and only paying attention to few, key data points

- Defensive Decision Making
	 - ^^A system that makes no [[error ]]is not [[intelligent]]^^
		 - regarding heuristics. the checkerboard example shows that we can make good errors

	 - intelligence means going beyond the information given and making informed decisions or bets
		 - by making bets every intelligent system makes "good" errors
			 - good errors are errors that need to be made in order to learn

			 - a [[negative error culture]], in which everyone lacks the courage to make a decision for which thy may be punished. 
				 - not making a decision or procrastinating in order to avoid responsibility is the most blatant form of [[defensive decision making]]
					 - defensive decision making is choosing the less optimal option to protect one's self in case something goes wrong

					 - the system can impose this culture

					 - an example is [[defensive medicine]] where doctors orders tests or treatments that are not clinically indicated and might even harm because of fear from litigation

	 - create [[checklists]] for [[automatic behaviors]]

	 - In situations where errors have been developed a tendency to avoid learning from experience. Instead, we rely on social learning of what to fear.
