	- But what most people don’t realize is that the resistance to writing is not unlike the resistance to other skills. And the antidote? Practice. Exposure. Iteration. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwq0eracgtch68qpjj0kh6c))
	- Practice makes any seemingly impossible task *familiar*. You can learn to write ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwq2b3skg3vap5qz2sejgn2))
	- The first step to becoming “a writer” is acknowledging that no metric defines someone as “a writer”. And that anyone unabashedly claiming to be an expert, is likely far from it. You know what makes you a writer? Writing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwq33cmx1e9sdc34z8r7by3))
	- Writing, just like all else, is a muscle that can be flexed and built up into a habitual process that eventually flows. Because at its core, writing is simple: it’s a method of sharing your thoughts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwq3gbmj75r463k5g16cb50))
	- Writing is essentially a robust tool that enables us to clarify and communicate our thoughts. While writing, you are forcing yourself to think critically and exercise parts of your brain that are typically on auto-pilot.  As Einstein once said, *“If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.”* In attempting to formulate a written piece, you are going through the exercise of transforming vague ideas into clarified concepts externally, but also internally.

	- But what is often overlooked is the fact that having a clarified, unique, and thoughtful point of view greatly reduces the mental load required to write in the first place. So which is the chicken and which is the egg? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwq6thgy8xdeqrsbz3q9tmn))

	- Writing and thinking are two peas in a powerful pod. Critical thinking leads to good writing, which leads to clearer thinking, and so on. By improving your writing, you are also improving your ability to think and vice versa. So then the question then becomes, how does one activate this process?

	- Writing Process Steps:
	  
	  •   Ideation - **Passive**
	  •   Tracking - **Active**
	  •   Outline - **Active**
	  •   Idea Arbitrage - **Passive**
	  •   Research - **Active**
	  •   Writing - **Active** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwqchp5rpf5w42mjtmsbew6))
	- In my opinion, writing should never be something that you do just to check off of your to-do list. At its core, writing is a mechanism to try to deliver value to others. And over time, I’ve defined that as my core goal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwwqeetr74h1dtrdz3m0c22f))
	- Step 1) Ideation: Passive
	  
	  The first step in my process is intentionally **passive**. In order to get my TAW loop going, I set an open invitation to my brain to take note of anything interesting. More specifically, I look for anything within the intersection of: (1) interesting, (2) doesn’t exist online in that exact form, and (3) something I can contribute uniquely to.
