- Notes:
	 - Deliberate practice differs from regular practice as it requires constant attention and examination of the activity the reaching the goals we want to improve through our practice. 

	 - Regular practice may repeat the same activities over and over again in the hope to improve a skill, but the act may become so repetitive that it veers on mindlessness and autopilot.
		 - Deliberate practice on the other hand aims to focus our attention throughout the act of deliberate practice. It aims to look for weaknesses and constant [[improvement]] through each repetition. We create a plan to improve our weaknesses to seek continuous progress.

		 - Deliberate practice means practicing with a clear awareness of the specific components of a skill we're aiming to improve and exactly how to improve them.

		 - Deliberate practice creates new physical and mental capabilities—it doesn’t just leverage existing ones.

	 - How to Implement deliberate practice
		 - The key in any area is to identify objective standards for performance, study top performers, and then design practice activities reflecting what they do.

		 - If we want to improve a skill, we need to know __what__ exactly has to change and what might get us there. Otherwise, we plateau. #blck:red

		 - Before we start practice, we need to plan.

		 - Deliberate practice is structured and methodological. We need to target our weaknesses and things that we can't do. Then at every stage create tailored, measurements to gauge progress and effectiveness towards our goal.   

		 - **Steps to implementation:** 
			 - Take the skill you’re aiming to improve and break it down into the smallest possible component parts. 

			 - Make a plan for working through them in a logical order, beginning with the fundamentals, then building upon them. 

			 - Decide which parts you’d like to master over the next month. 

			 - Put your practice sessions in your calendar, then plan precisely which parts of the skill you’re going to work on during each session.

	 - Deliberate practice is challenging and uncomfortable.
		 - Noel Tichy, professor at the University of Michigan business school and the former chief of General Electric’s famous management development center at Crotonville, puts the concept of practice into three zones: **the comfort zone**, **the learning zone**, and **the panic zone**.
			 - Most of the time when we’re practicing, we’re really doing activities in our comfort zone. This doesn’t help us improve because we can already do these activities easily. On the other hand, operating in the panic zone leaves us paralyzed, as the activities are too difficult and we don’t know where to start. The only way to make progress is to operate in the learning zone, which are those activities that are just out of our reach.

			 - Repetition inside the comfort zone does not equal deliberate practice. Deliberate practice requires that you operate in the learning zone and you repeat the activity a lot with feedback.

			 - **How to implement this:** Each time you practice a component of a skill, aim to make it 10% harder than the level you find comfortable.
				 - Once per month, have a practice session where you set yourself an incredibly ambitious stretch goal—not impossible, just well above your current level. Challenge yourself to see how close you can get to it. You might surprise yourself and find you perform far better than expected.

				 - A common deliberate practice mistake is to plan a long practice session, then adjust the intensity of your practice to allow you to engage in a skill for the whole time. It’s far more effective to engage in “sprints.” 
					 - Practice with the most intense focus you can manage for short periods of time, then take breaks. Seeing as you learn most when you stretch yourself beyond your current capabilities, shorter, more challenging practice periods are the way to go.

	 - Deliberate practice requires rest and recovery time
		 - Deliberate practice when done properly should only be sustainable for a few hours, between 3 to five hours continuously each day. Even one hour a day of deliberate practice is beneficial as compounded activities will benefit you in the long term when done committedly.

		 - Sleep is a vital part of deliberate practice. Being asleep doesn’t mean you’re not still improving your skill. We consolidate memories at night, moving them from short-term to [long-term memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768102/). And we can’t exactly benefit from deliberate practice sessions if we don’t remember what we learn each time. Not only that, but sleep deprivation also results in a plethora of negative cognitive effects that impact performance. If we skimp on sleep, we’re likely to forget far more of what we learn during deliberate practice sessions, rendering them less useful.

		 - When we're not practicing deliberately, the state of our mind is still useful, termed diffuse mode. This is the state of our minds where it is at rest and our thoughts can freely wander. Even though we may be tempted to keep our minds in deliberate practice, this isn't sustainable and the wandering rested mode is synergistic with a deliberate practiced mind. 

		 - We can practice a diffused state of mind by taking a walk, listening to music or staring out the window. 

	 - Deliberate practice involves constant [[feedback]] and [[measurement]]
		 - To make our deliberate practice useful, we need to create [[feedback loop]]s and tailor made measurements. Otherwise, we're wasting our time with mindless actions and only going through the motions.

		 - #metrics To find insight in our practice, our measurements must target parts of the practice correctly to gain insights on how are metrics are changing over time. This change is how we determine if we are practicing correctly.

			 - Finding the correct metrics to measure can be challenging in the field of business compared to sports. Established and validated metrics and measurements may not exist. We must ensure that our metrics are correlated to performance. 

			 - Avoid vanity metrics, numbers that make us feel good about our practice, even though they may provide little feedback on our progress. 

		 - Identify the most significant metrics related to performance in your chosen skill and keep a record of them each time you practice. It’s easy to fool yourself without a clear record of how you’re doing. You might want to break the skill down into a few different parts to measure it, but make sure you’re not fixating on vanity metrics.

	 - Deliberate practice is most effective with the help of a coach or some kind of teacher
		 - But what if you don’t have access to a coach? What if you don’t have the means to hire one or one isn’t available for your particular skill? In that case, it’s still possible to apply the same principles that make a coach useful by yourself. Top performers across fields build the skill of [[metacognition]], essentially making it possible for them to coach themselves. Colvin explains:

		 - > The best performers observe themselves closely. They are in effect able to step outside themselves, monitor what is happening in their own minds, and ask how it’s going. Researchers call this metacognition—knowledge about your own knowledge, thinking about your own thinking. Top performers do this much more systematically than others do; it’s an established part of their routine

		 - > .…A critical part of self-evaluation is deciding what caused those errors. Average performers believe their errors were caused by factors outside their control: my opponent got lucky; the task was too hard; I just don’t have the natural ability for this. Top performers, by contrast, believe they are responsible for their errors. Note that this is not just a difference of personality or attitude. Recall that the best performers have set highly specific, technique-based goals and strategies for themselves; they have thought through exactly how they intend to achieve what they want. So when something doesn’t work, they can relate the failure to specific elements of their performance that may have misfired.

	 - Deliberate practice requires intrinsic motivation
		 - Deliberate practice should be a continual process for improvement that requires commitment. Even though the practice is difficult and challenging, if we have intrinsic motivators, we can continue to apply deliberate practice on a daily basis despite the struggles. However, if our motivation is external, we may not be able to persevere past the discomfort and challenges of deliberate practice.

		 - If you’re planning to engage in deliberate practice to reach expert-level performance, make sure it’s a prospect you feel excited about even if it won’t always be fun.

		 - **How to implement this:** Make a list of the reasons you want to work on a skill and the benefits getting better at it might bring. Before you begin a deep practice session, reread the list to remind you of why you’re bringing your full focus to something difficult. You could also list some of the benefits you’ve experienced from it in the past or include quotes from top performers in your field you find inspiring.

	 - Deliberate practice takes time and can be a lifelong process
		 - Although deliberate practice tends to result in much faster progress than normal practice, truly mastering a skill is a lifelong process. Reaching the top of a field can take years or even decades, depending on its competitiveness. As the bar for success in many areas keeps rising, more deliberate practice is required to stand out.

		 - Creative genius tends to come after ten years of studying relevant knowledge and developing skills. Hayes referred to this as the “ten years of silence.”

		 - Making a breakthrough takes time. When it seems like someone was an overnight success, there’s almost always a long period of silent deliberate practice preceding it. Innate talents are just a starting point. If we want to master a skill, we need to commit to working on it for a lengthy period of time, likely with few rewards. While there are no assurances that with struggle comes reward, without it the odds are lower.

	 - Deliberate practice requires intense focus
		 - Intense focus can increase the benefits of the deliberate practice.

		 - Intense focus allows us to increase skills and break through plateaus.

		 - A benefit of getting constant feedback is that it shows you what moves the needle towards improved performance and what is just running in place. Certain practice activities can feel good without having any impact. Top performers prioritize [knowing what to prioritize](https://fs.blog/2017/03/focusing-art-not-science/). They always start with the most important thing because anything else is a distraction.
