- #Takeaways
	- We need to focus on a few active projects in order to create quality output. We risk lowering the quality of our work if we take on too much or say yes to everything.
	- Sometimes we have to say to less than optimal projects for necessary short term gains, but eventually we need to ensure we have a plan in place for getting out.
- How can I apply this for:
  collapsed:: true
	- project management
		- Assess if you have too many projects if you have taken on too many projects and roles. See where the risks are in terms of lowered quality.
		- Assess if you are in charge of competing priorities that turns into lowered quality output.
	- communication
	- knowledge management
	- value creation
		- for supervisors
		- for senior leadership
		- for colleagues

	- What was the net effect of chasing F&B as a product? Well, one of the original goals that we had for the company was to execute a ‘land-and-expand’ strategy using our POS systems as a beachhead. The repeated distractions from doing F&B prevented us from making much headway on those goals.

	- I remember feeling rather sanguine when learning about this. I maintain that we *should’ve* cut our development efforts around F&B much earlier than we did. I think the constant drag of F&B deals and F&B deployments distracted us from working on the other two product categories. And I suspect — though I have no way to prove it — that it cost us about two years of progress.
	- But we needed the cash. We needed to make payroll. And god knows if the company would’ve been able to reach its current level of success if we hadn’t tried going after the F&B market, and if we hadn’t learnt all those lessons the hard way.
	- Focus is saying no to good ideas. But sometimes focus isn’t possible.

He was trying to get out during his career at this place only to find out the company eventually followed his ideas years after he left.
	- In other words, his first action was not a “what” decision, it was a “who” and “how” decision. This is an incredibly important difference. Jeff did not jump straight to focusing on what product to build, which seems like the straightest line from A to B. Instead, the choices he made suggest he believed that the scale of the opportunity was large and that the scope of the work required to achieve success was equally large and complex. He focused first on how to organize the team and who was the right leader to achieve the right result.
		- **Note:** Jeff Bezos' response to seeing Jobs demo the Itunes Windows application. He didn't rush out and make a clone competitor. Don't react too quickly and panic when presented with opportunities or risks/issues rather think through the situation to ensure correct decision making.
	- But Jeff felt that if we tried to manage digital media as a part of the physical media business, it would never be a priority. The bigger business carried the company after all, and it would always get the most attention. Steve told me that getting digital right was highly important to Jeff, and he wanted Steve to focus on nothing else. Steve wanted me to join him and help him create the new business.
		- **Note:** Single threaded leadership - This decision to put one single leader in charge an initiative is so those initiatives don't compete with each other under one person. So not one person has to handle digital and physical media.
	- Eventually, I appreciated the importance of organizing this way. If we had tried to figure out how to deliver digital media while also managing our online physical-media business, we could not have moved quickly enough. We would not have thought big enough about how to reinvent the customer experience as we did when we built our own e-reader device and service. The customer experience would undoubtedly have been a subpar mishmash of the physical and digital business approaches. We had to start from scratch.
		- **Note:** About single threaded leadership.
	- In reality, everything has some cost — and the number of things you can execute concurrently to a high degree of quality is extremely limited.
