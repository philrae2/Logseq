	- A military leader has to lead a unit to become a leader. They have to get their hands dirty. They need the experience. They need to make mistakes. They need to know how to recover from mistakes. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JL9CXHN&location=190))
	- There is rarely an objectively correct recommendation that stands out from all the options available to a client. It is very difficult to know if a strategy will work. A very good strategy often looks exactly like a very bad strategy. The results from a set of correctly structured analyses often tell us little by themselves. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JL9CXHN&location=196))
	- Analysis is messy. Data is flawed. It has holes. Data is misleading. Best practices fail. Consultants uncover new information every single day of an engagement that slightly nudges the original hypotheses. The ability to remain flexible and adapt is what matters. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JL9CXHN&location=206))
	- Too much thinking about strategy assumes all that is needed is frameworks, hypotheses, and analyses, and the answer magically appears. Strategy is a process of constantly iterating the implications of the findings. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JL9CXHN&location=242))
	- I would not make the most gifted team member the engagement manager. That is Albert. I do not want him to be bogged down by the daily burden of coordinating the team. Albert needs to have freedom to roam around the engagement, under my guidance, and develop insights on the value analyses. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JL9CXHN&location=562))
	- Your best playmaker should not be burdened with the captaincy. They should have the freedom to roam around, knowing the captain will orchestrate the game around them. ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JL9CXHN&location=567))
	- What you do does not matter. How you do it matters, and it matters intensely. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JL9CXHN&location=576))
	- Artists must sign their work. You must have pride in what you do. You must want your name to be attached to the engagement. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JL9CXHN&location=586))
	- The founding mandate of an organization plays a critical role in determining its strategy to execute that mandate. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09JL9CXHN&location=594))
