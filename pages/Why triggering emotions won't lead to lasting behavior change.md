- tags: #behavior #[[change management]]

- Description:
	 - [[Emotion nudges are temporary]]. 
		 - Using activity mobilizing emotions such as fun, hope, anger or fear can work exceptionally well to kickstart a new habit but are usually not long-lasting.

		 - The nudges that work to influence with lasting effects are usually invisible to the users, like putting vegetarian options at the top of the menu or putting ceramic cups next to the coffee machine instead of paper cups.
			 - The less conscious nudges, the less prone they are from wearing off

	 - Moral nudges reward "doing the right" thing. They are meant to be noticed by people.

	 - Pure nudges are not meant to be consciously noticed by individuals. They are the product placement in the grocery stores.

	 - To create lasting behavior we need design to choice in our environments, rather than relying on emotional nudges.
