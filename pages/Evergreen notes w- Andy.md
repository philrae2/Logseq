- [[Evergreen Notes should be atomic]]
	 - Permanent notes should be only about one thing, one idea that captures as much as possible the entirety of that one thing
		 - Put things that belong together in the note, but separate concerns from one another.

		 - This makes formation of connections across topics and context easier.

		 - Allows the evergreen note to be reuseable in other works

	 - The evergreen note should be small enough in scope that you can finish in well under half an hour (a few minutes to write)

	 - The note should broaden or provide nuance to the network of links about the concept

	 - Each note should represent an increment in your thinking about that specific idea

- [[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]
	 - When we create links between our notes it makes us explore the other expansive possibilities of concepts that maybe related 

	 - Prefer fine grained associations vs tags
		 - Example: "I see paper X relates to paragraph N"

		 - Tags are ineffective association structure
			 - They are ineffective with describing relationships that may not be heterogeneous

			 - Provide a few words of contexts about why an item relates to a particular tags.
				 - We should prefer labeled associations
					 - Example: It‚Äôs often not enough to say ‚ÄúX is related to Y‚Äù: better to say ‚ÄúX goes into more detail about Y in the context of Z.‚Äù

					 - The extra context will be a cue for your memory or evaluation of the linked material, which will help you effectively navigate the knowledge graph and retrace your former thought processes.

	 - Prefer explicit associations to inferred associations
		 - First: Processing the relationships between items forces us to engage with the information

		 - Second: We want to curate our relationships so it can be high-signal. 
			 - This allows us to quickly evaluate without navigating throughout the associated items.

- [[Evergreen notes should be concept oriented]]
	 - Concept oriented organization leads to better discovery of connections between notes as opposed to  organizing by author, book, event, project, topic, etc.

	 - The straightforward way creating notes when reading a book is creating the notes under that book but they are not concept oriented. 
		 - The notes is automatically categorized under the book title, rather than concept oriented. 

		 - Do we atomize our notes under the book heading and link it to a concept?

	 - Most notes collected are going to be fleeting notes
