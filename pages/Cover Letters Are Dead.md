- I think cover letters are dead. Learning how to write a good cover 
  letter is taking you down a useless rabbit hole. It could take a couple 
  of hours, you will research letter templates online, maybe download a 
  few…and in general drive yourself nuts as to what to put in it and how 
  to format it.
  
  “How to write a cover letter for a resume” should 
  really read “Why a simple cover letter in email is all you need”. Why? 
  Most companies with more than a handful of employees will have a very 
  efficient human resources department, and likely some form of automated 
  resume system for job seekers. This means almost everything you submit 
  goes either directly into a resume software system, or to one or more 
  email boxes of internal recruiters.
  
  What happens next is your 
  resume is scanned – either automatically or my a recruiter, and if it 
  doesn’t meet the basic needs of the open job position, it gets rejected 
  quickly. Very quickly.
## Why Writing a Cover Letter Doesn’t Help

I likely will be in the minority of [guidance you find online](https://web.archive.org/web/20200303062923/http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2011/03/24/how-to-write-a-cover-letter/#7083058035fa)
 around this topic. Writing a good cover letter – regardless of format 
or templates used, simply won’t help your chances at any company but the
 smallest. Why? Because hiring managers are busy. In fact if they have 
open positions they are even busier filling in for the empty gap in 
their organization. The HR department is busy fielding online 
submissions [and still the occasional written mailed submission] for the
 open position. In over 20 years of experience I have only seen a cover 
letter reach my desk a handful of times. And I never read it.

Why?
 Because I can scan a resume in 30 seconds and know if the individual is
 a potential fit and worth having HR do a phone screen on. A cover 
letter is not going to tell me anything a resume doesn’t. In fact, as 
you research how to write your cover letter, you will find they all say 
basically the same thing:
- You express interest in the position
- You highlight 2-3 significant accmplishments that are applicable to this role
- You mention your overall experience in 2-3 sentences
- You say a few words to sell yourself – how your experience and education are unique.
  
  Getting the drift? Go look at some [cover letter samples](https://web.archive.org/web/20200303062923/https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/723/03/)
   and tell me they don’t all look cookie-cutter. I know almost every 
  university placement office recommends writing a nice cover letter and 
  emphasizing your education, teamwork, academic record, etc. – but I’m 
  here to tell you that as someone that has hired hundreds of people they 
  won’t be seen by the hiring manager.
  
  We don’t have time. We need 
  HR to screen resumes for relevant experience or education, meeting 
  minimal job requirements, and then they pass these over to me to see if I
   concur. I can tell within 30 seconds if someone may be a fit, then I 
  hit reply and email back a request to do a phone interview.
  
  What 
  exactly does anyone thing a cover letter is going to show me that would 
  effect my decision to move someone to a phone interview or reject them? 
  Nothing. The resume is what gives me what I need.
## Online Job Submissions with Cover Letters with Your Resume

I would estimate more than 80% and maybe even closer to 100% of jobs you will apply for will be done online through a[ job search board ](https://web.archive.org/web/20200303062923/http://www.interview-aid.com/2016/04/06/job-search-sites-how-to-search-for-a-job/)or
 directly on a company web site. Most systems have the ability to accept
 a cover letter upload – I’ve never used it. Why? Because again it gets 
loaded into the system with your resume, your resume is scanned and 
dissected to break out keywords and experiences, and the letter file 
simply gets stored along with the scanned version of your resume. I 
personally have never met a hiring manager I’ve worked with that has 
read them. Best case is someone in HR may read it before proceeding – 
but this isn’t super useful. After all, the hiring manager will only be 
looking at your resume anyway regardless of HR provides them. Trust me. 
We don’t have time to do otherwise.

You should include a nice 
email if there is an option to do this, or even an “electronic version” 
of a cover letter versus a full word document. However, it is a 
formality – so keep it to the following format:
- Express interest in the position
- Indicate willingness to relocate if applicable
- Mention 1-2 key facts of research you’ve done on the company or position and why you are the perfect fit based on that
  
  That’s
   it – no more. Do not agonize over writing some formal letter, what 
  template or format you should use, whether it is a good cover letter or 
  bad – in short do NOT put any emphasis or weight on it. **Keep it simple if you must do one, and check the box that you’ve done it.**
  
  **Your
   time is much better spent ensuring you have an excellent resume, and 
  that you have tailored it for the job you are applying for.**
  
  Cover
   letters to me are like spam – they all look the same, there isn’t any 
  relevant information in them I need, and I never want to see them. Show 
  me the resume and let me digest quickly whether I want HR to call you 
  and start vetting you as a job candidate for my group.
  
  Love my 
  perspective or hate it. Call me a non-traditionalist. But I am a 
  realist. Cover letters are a blast from the past when an open position 
  would get a handful of submissions by regular mail written on a 
  typewriter – long before the advent of computers and online job searches
   and submissions.
