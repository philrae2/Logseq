- Notes:
	 - Humanity is [[diverse]] and the world we live in is diverse. The diversity and [[complexity]] of our environment can be frightening because it isn't neat and simple. We want to [[forget]] the many possibilities that are open to us.
		 - We want to be told there are only a [[few [[possibilities]]]], rather than face the reality of a [[manifold]] world. We prefer the neat, orderly, and few choices. And in this [[deception]] of a [[simplified]] world one way is common and the other way is celebrated as superior.
			 - We in turn praise and elevate people who [[simplify]] our world for us, who limit the many possibilities for us, who tell us how to think and act. We make[[ leader]]s out of people and defer our [[Decision Making]] as long as they tell us our way of doing things are good, the other way is wrong, while we [[deceive]] ourselves and ignore the myriad of other possibilities the world offers us. 
				 - These leaders are celebrated because they offer us a simple choice and saves us from [[complexity]] and [[confusion]]. They offer us a [[single choice]] that is easy to take because people who don't take the choice are commended to live  a wretched life.  
					 - Similarly we make employ [[Judgmental Heuristics]] to simplify choices and information.

					 - Not all [[simplicity]] is [[wise]], but a wealth of possibilities breeds [[fear]], so [[Z: those who speak of many possibilities speak to the few and are a help to even fewer]].

		 - Our minds aren't built to take in so much stimulus and information from our world and we developed [[Judgmental Heuristics]] to process incoming information. These [[Heuristics]] simplify our [[Decision Making]].
			 - In employing [[Judgmental Heuristics]], though we simplified decision making, we have made [[deceiving]] ourselves or by others much easier through triggering our [[biases]] stemming from [[Judgmental Heuristics]].
