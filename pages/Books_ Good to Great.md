	- Chapter 1 - Good is the Enemy of Great
	  collapsed:: true
		- [[The goodness of a company can keep us complacent to our results in striving for greatness.]]
			- "OK" results or our failure to assess or processes or results make us ignorant to an alternative possibility where we are great, not just good.

		- Many of the companies listed as good to great are no longer in business? What made them fail? Example: Fannie Mae, Circuit City
		- Data from the book coming good to great:
			- Ten of eleven good to great companies had CEOs come from inside the company, whereas the comparison companies tried outside CEOs
			- No correlation on CEO compensation structure from good to great
			- Comparison companies and good to great companies weren't separated on strategy. All had good strategies to start with
			- Good to great companies not only focused on what to do but also focused on what not to do and stopping what they were already doing
			- Technology can accelerate transformation but can't cause the transformation
			- Acquisition had little to do with transformation from good to great
			- The good-to-great people paid little attention to managing change, motivating people or creating alignment. Under the right condition the problems of commitment, alignment and change largely disappears
				- Unsure of this finding? What are the conditions to make these challenges go away?
		- [[Framework of taking a company from good to great]]
		  id:: 96f1c63e-13ca-41e7-a32b-e55eda1a89e2
			- Leadership: Leaders weren't the high profile celebrity leaders like Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos, rather they were self-effacing, quite, reserved, even shy. They are a blend of humility and professional will
			- __First who then what__: People are not your most import asset. The right people are. Concentrate on your best workers, figure out what to do with your under performers.
			- __Confront the brutal facts__:[[Stockdale Paradox]] You must maintain unwavering faith that you can and will prevail in the end, regardless of the difficulties, and at the same time have the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.
			- __The hedgehog concept __( simplicity within 3 concepts)
				- [[If we aren't the best in the world in our business then it cannot be the basis that makes us great]].
					- We have to replace it with a simple concept the reflects deep understanding of three intersecting circles:

						- [[culture of discipline]]
							- A culture of discipline doesn't need hierarchy or bureaucracy because individuals are self-leaders who act in the best interest for the group and great performance is created.

						- **technology accelerators**
							- Good to great [[technology]] don't depend on technology as the primary foundation for [[innovation]].
						- **The flywheel and the Doom loop**
							- Impactful change happens iteratively, even if it doesn't seem that way. When companies create change too quickly by creating a revolution or dramatic change programs they are most likely to fail.

			- Level 5 Leaders put away their egos and put the health of their organization at the forefront. They are incredibly ambitious but it is foremost for the institution, not themselves.

			  id:: 298a731c-72ce-4edc-a8eb-103644cc6530
	- #[[change management]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Great leaders don't enact change right away, they first make sure they have the right people brought into the group and the wrong people removed. They first begin with "who" before dealing with "what" to do.
			- Finding the right people is crucial. We want people who are flexible to change if the plans need to change. We need people who are self-motivated so we don't have to solve the problem of motivation.
			- If we have the wrong people it doesn't matter whether you discover the right direction; you still won't have a great company.
		- If we can't predict the future we hire people who are flexible to adapt and thrive when the future hits.
	- #[[character traits]] #education 
	  collapsed:: true
		- The good to great companies placed greater weight on character attributes than on specific education background, practical skills, specialized knowledge, or work experience.
			- Skills and knowledge are more teachable than character
	- #culture
	  collapsed:: true
		- We will not have a great life if we don't respect and love the people we s pend the majority of our time with. If we love/like the people we spend time with the easier it is to love the work that we do.
	- #[[decision making]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- To figure out how to [[succeed]] in an ever changing environment we need to [[experiment]] to try to get out answers from the environment. Experiments allow us to get data to make informed decisions.
			- Use experimentation to beat out the shallow thinking. We have to be honest to find the truth, even if it shows us we're wrong and especially if it makes us uncomfortable. The answers will become more apparent. Without confronting the brutal facts we cannot make correct decisions.
	- #focus
	  collapsed:: true
		- Hedgehog vs fox
			- Foxes are the symbolism for people who are doing multiple things at once. They pursue many ends at once. Hedgehogs only do one thing at a time. They simplify a complex world into a single organizing idea, a basic principle or concept that unifies and guides everything.
				- This is like [[Steve Jobs]] with understanding complexity to be able to simplify it.
				- Have a simple goal with a simple and uncomplicated plan to achieve it. We have to have intention to our plans.
			- Strategy has to be based on deep understanding and translated to knowledge into simple and a clear concept that guides all their efforts.
	- #Leadership
	  collapsed:: true
		- Qualities of a a good leader (level-5) ((313b5ed7-a0e6-473a-a294-0d471615dbc9))
			- **Professional will**
				- Create superb results, a clear catalyst in the transition from good to great
				- Demonstrate unwavering resolve to do whatever must be done to produce results, no matter how difficult
				- Set the standard of building an enduring great company, will settle for nothing less
				- Never blames other people, external factors, or bad luck.
			- **Personal Humility**
				- Demonstrates modesty and humbleness, shuns public adulation, never boastful
				- Acts with quite calm, determination. Relies on standards and personal charisma to motivate
				- Channels ambition into the company, sets up successors for future leadership
				- Apportions success to others and good luck. Doesn't steal the glory
		- Good leaders have unwavering resolve to do what must be done
			- Level-5 leadership involves ferocious resolve and determination to do whatever needs to be done to make the company great. Level-5 leaders are not only humble but have the need to produce results: Level-5 leaders cannot stand mediocrity in any form and would be intolerant of any one thinking good was good enough.
		- You don't need to be an outsider to transform your company
			- You only need tow ant to strive for excellence
		- Towering, [charismatic]([[charisma]]), [[dominant]], [[authoritarian]], (large and oppressive) both positive and negative aspects can deter [[feedback]] especially bad news from reaching these types of leaders because of fear of the largeness of their personalities.
			- Winston Churchill was aware of this and created the statistical office, an outside department away from the control of the normal chain of command. The statistical office main's function was to feed him updated and completely unfiltered brutal facts of reality. Facts are better than dreams.
	- #management
		- The moment you feel the need to tightly manage someone, you've made a hiring mistake. The best people don't need to be managed, guided, taught, led—yes, but not tightly managed.
	- #motivation
		- Expending energy trying to motivate people is largely a waste of time. If we have the right people then we don't need to motivate them.
			- The important question is how not to demotivate them? False hope and ignorance of reality is demotivating.
			- Create opportunities for everyone to be heard so the truth can be heard. #Listening
		- Those who turn good into great are motivated by a deep creative urge and inner compulsion to seek [[excellence]] for its own sake. Those who build and perpetuate mediocrity, in contrast, are motivated by [[fear]].
	- #performance
		- Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems.
		  id:: 99bcb8ea-f389-4d42-b02e-ad618bee7c19
		- Good to great companies are not ruthless, but rather rigorous. These companies kept only the A-players and was ruthless in letting go of [[underperformer]]s. "The only way to deliver to the people who are achieving is to not burden them with people who are not achieving."
			- Rigor in a good to great company applies first at the top, focused on those who hold the largest burden of responsibility
			- Letting the wrong people hang around is unfair to all the right people and waiting too long is unfair to the people that need too get off the bus.
	- #[[Problem Solving]]
		- Before trying to solve problems, first try to get rid of [[assumption]] and make sure we are all in agreement of the definition and framing of the problem.
		- Managing problems can only make us good, building opportunities is the only way to become great. Don't waste or spend all your time problem solving caused by others, instead of solve problems that bring opportunities or create them yourselves.
		  id:: 00d4fe77-9fd0-4caa-9e51-4461a01b5fd3
		- __Lead with Questions__
			- Don't assume, from the start, you know what you're doing. take your statements and reframe them as questions, then find answers to them. Ask questions until we have a clear picture of reality. You only ask questions to gain understanding not as a form of manipulation or as a way to blame or put others down.
		- __Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion__
			- Engage people in debate, start discussions and negotiations. Gather information and destroy assumptions before making decisions.
		- __Conduct autopsies without blame__
			- Don't hide mistakes instead discuss it openly. We need to listen to smart dissenting questions. We need to draw them out while filtering out noise.
			- When we conduct [[postmortem]]s without blame we create a culture where truth is offered and heard.
		- Build Red Flag Mechanisms
			- More information doesn't necessarily mean better results we need better processes and intelligent intake of them. We need to create actionable and effective actions that turn into results from the data and information we collected.
			  id:: 95d7689a-f819-40d4-ab38-41e60b0a267d
			- Create a red flag system where anyone can challenge the thoughts, policies, and recommendation of anyone else to defeat authority gaps and non-participation of employees.
			  id:: fab16050-d5c8-460e-846f-29e8a089a252
	- #[[resources]]
		- To save time and not be consumed with work we need to a good team to work on the opportunity or problem.
	- #reputation #Leadership #success
		- Leaders more concerned with their own reputation for personal greatness, often failed to set the company up for success in the next generation
			- Rubbermaid was led by Stanley Gault. Tyrannical and egocentric, he made the company very successful with his authoritarian style but Gault did not build processes that would ensure Rubbermaid's success when he left the company.
				- Gault was a level-4  leader, not a level-5. Level-5 creates processes and strategies for when they are gone. They talk in "we" and not in "I".
	- #technology
		- Technology of itself isn't the cause of momentum, rather an accelerator of it. To use technology productively in a transformation from good to great we need to correctly assess if the right technology fits into the organization and if so, how it fits. Don't use technology that we don't understand.
		- Technology alone doesn't create sustainable great results.
	- #variability #luck
		- Level 5 leadership recognize how variability and luck plays a role in the project outcomes. However other leaders who attribute negative outcomes to only bad luck, Level 5 leaders will acknowledge luck also in good outcomes.
- #[[Reference Notes]]
	- Yes, leadership is about vision. But leadership is equally about creating a climate where the truth is heard and the brutal facts confronted. There’s a huge difference between the opportunity to “have your say” and the opportunity to be heard. The good-to-great leaders understood this distinction, creating a culture wherein people had a tremendous opportunity to be heard and, ultimately, for the truth to be heard.
	  id:: 5969d5b5-9eba-461f-9aff-bf5a54681858
	- Good to great comes about by a cumulative process—step by step, action by action, decision by decision, turn by turn of the flywheel—that adds up to sustained and spectacular results.
	  id:: 400c3af5-44eb-4eb0-a13d-93e74c0652cd
	- Often, the media does not cover a company until the flywheel is already turning at a thousand rotations per minute. This entirely skews our perception of how such transformations happen, making it seem as if they jumped right to breakthrough as some sort of an overnight metamorphosis.
	  id:: 45a48a07-cbba-4346-8789-d2cf395be980
	- But, no matter how short or long it took, every good-to-great transformation followed the same basic pattern—accumulating momentum, turn by turn of the flywheel— until buildup transformed into breakthrough.
	  id:: 8832c6e5-c016-4cbb-8c35-dcdeff099d3e
	- lasting transformations from good to great follow a general pattern of buildup followed by breakthrough. In some cases, the buildup-to-breakthrough stage takes a long time, in other cases, a shorter time.
	  id:: f45d2ea7-b7d7-469b-a5c2-3835f1f229cc
	- The good-to-great companies understood a simple truth: Tremendous power exists in the fact of continued improvement and the delivery of results.
	  id:: 7edad4b0-25fd-4c7f-90ce-56fa1bdd9eb1
	- Clearly, the good-to-great companies did get incredible commitment and alignment—they artfully managed change—but they never really spent much time thinking about it. It was utterly transparent to them. We learned that under the right conditions, the problems of commitment, alignment, motivation, and change just melt away. They largely take care of themselves.
	  id:: 0f5c5e3f-6ec2-47e5-b3e1-d02423a5d2c5
	- When you let the flywheel do the talking, you don’t need to fervently communicate your goals. People can just extrapolate from the momentum of the flywheel for themselves: “Hey, if we just keep doing this, look at where we can go!” As people decide among themselves to turn the fact of potential into the fact of results, the goal almost sets itself.
	  id:: 3f00c02f-1214-47de-b31f-c1757aa62df9
	- Stop and think about it for a minute. What do the right people want more than almost anything else? They want to be part of a winning team. They want to contribute to producing visible, tangible results. They want to feel the excitement of being involved in something that just flat-out works. When the right people see a simple plan born of confronting the brutal facts—a plan developed from understanding, not bravado—they are likely to say, “That’ll work. Count me in.” When they see the monolithic unity of the executive team behind the simple plan and the selfless, dedicated qualities of Level 5 leadership, they’ll drop their cynicism. When people begin to feel the magic of momentum—when they begin to see tangible results, when they can feel the flywheel beginning to build speed—that’s when the bulk of people line up to throw their shoulders against the wheel and push.

	- THE DOOM LOOP We found a very different pattern at the comparison companies. Instead of a quiet, deliberate process of figuring out what needed to be done and then simply doing it, the comparison companies frequently launched new programs—often with great fanfare and hoopla aimed at “motivating the troops”—only to see the programs fail to produce sustained results. They sought the single defining action, the grand program, the one killer innovation, the miracle moment that would allow them to skip the arduous buildup stage and jump right to breakthrough. They would push the fly-wheel in one direction, then stop, change course, and throw it in a new direction—and then they would stop, change course, and throw it into yet another direction. After years of lurching back and forth, the comparison companies failed to build sustained momentum and fell instead into what we came to call the doom loop.
	  id:: 1940c63f-42f4-47a0-9d79-ca02bcad12c2
	- Why did the good-to-great companies have a substantially higher success rate with acquisitions, especially major acquisitions? The key to their success was that their big acquisitions generally took place after development of the Hedgehog Concept and after the flywheel had built significant momentum. They used acquisitions as an accelerator of flywheel momentum, not a creator of it.
	  id:: 9e1b3691-29fa-43e6-b23c-1f09103a0493
	- Often with their core business under siege, the comparison companies would dive into a big acquisition as a way to increase growth, diversify away their troubles, or make a CEO look good. Yet they never addressed the fundamental question: **“What can we do better than any other company in the world, that fits our economic denominator and that we have passion for?” They never learned the simple truth that, while you can buy your way to growth, you absolutely cannot buy your way to greatness.**
	- Leaders Who Stop the Flywheel The other frequently observed doom loop pattern is that of new leaders who stepped in, stopped an already spinning flywheel, and threw it in an entirely new direction.
	  id:: 0bcbc6c9-0779-4b34-9f2f-aed66ee3f694
	- Each piece of the system reinforces the other parts of the system to form an integrated whole that is much more powerful than the sum of the parts. It is only through consistency over time, through multiple generations, that you get maximum results.
	  id:: 49c9c8d7-12da-4328-8de9-270408224925
	- In a sense, everything in this book is an exploration and description of the pieces of the buildup-to-breakthrough flywheel pattern. (See the table on page 183.) In standing back to survey the overall framework, we see that every factor works together to create this pattern, and each component produces a push on the flywheel.
	- It all starts with Level 5 leaders, who naturally gravitate toward the fly-wheel model. They’re less interested in flashy programs that make it look like they are Leading! with a capital L. They’re more interested in the quiet, deliberate process of pushing on the flywheel to produce Results! with a capital R.
	- To make the shift from a company with sustained great results to an enduring great company of iconic stature, apply the central concept from Built to Last: Discover your core values and purpose beyond just making money (core ideology) and combine this with the dynamic of preserve the core/stimulate progress.
	- The “HP Way,” as it became known, reflected a deeply held set of core values that distinguished the company more than any of its products. These values included technical contribution, respect for the individual, responsibility to the communities in which the company operates, and a deeply held belief that profit is not the fundamental goal of a company.
	- That extra dimension is a guiding philosophy or a “core ideology,” which consists of core values and a core purpose (reason for being beyond just making money). These resemble the principles in the Declaration of Independence (“We hold these truths to be self-evident”)—never perfectly followed, but always present as an inspiring standard and an answer to the question of why it is important that we exist.
	  id:: a0003bc2-490e-4164-ae93-0f416f0613ca
	- An important caveat to the concept of core values is that there are no specific “right” core values for becoming an enduring great company. No matter what core value you propose, we found an enduring great company that does not have that specific core value. A company need not have passion for its customers (Sony didn’t), or respect for the individual (Disney didn’t), or quality (Wal-Mart didn’t), or social responsibility (Ford didn’t) in order to become enduring and great. **This was one of the most paradoxical findings from Built to Last—core values are essential for enduring greatness, but it doesn’t seem to matter what those core values are. The point is not what core values you have, but that you have core values at all, that you know what they are, that you build them explicitly into the organization, and that you preserve them over time.**
	- Enduring great companies preserve their core values and purpose while their business strategies and operating practices endlessly adapt to a changing world. This is the magical combination of “preserve the core and stimulate progress.”
	- **Genius of AND. Embrace both extremes on a number of dimensions at the same time. Instead of choosing A OR B, figure out how to have A AND B—purpose AND profit, continuity AND change, freedom AND responsibility, etc. 3.** #[[Q - How to be innovative]]
	- Core Ideology. Instill core values (essential and enduring tenets) and core purpose (fundamental reason for being beyond just making money) as principles to guide decisions and inspire people throughout the organization over a long period of time. 4. Preserve the Core/Stimulate Progress. Preserve the core ideology as an anchor point while stimulating change, improvement, innovation, and renewal in everything else. Change practices and strategies while holding core values and purpose fixed. Set and achieve BHAGs consistent with the core ideology.
	- They’re just focusing on the right things, and not the wrong things. They’re doing virtually everything we write about in this book, within their specific situation, and not wasting time on anything that doesn’t fit. Simple, clean, straightforward, elegant—and a heck of a lot of fun.
	- When all these pieces come together, not only does your work move toward greatness, but so does your life. For, in the end, it is impossible to have a great life unless it is a meaningful life. And it is very difficult to have a meaningful life without meaningful work. Perhaps, then, you might gain that rare tranquillity that comes from knowing that you’ve had a hand in creating something of intrinsic excellence that makes a contribution. Indeed, you might even gain that deepest of all satisfactions: knowing that your short time here on this earth has been well spent, and that it mattered. Epilogue Frequently Asked Questions Q: Did you originally identify more than eleven good-to-great possibilities and, if so, what good-to-great examples did not make it into the study?
- Takeaways
	- If we consider ourselves "good" in work output, this complacency can become a hurdle in becoming great from good.
	- Good leadership is having the foresight of what will bring you success and the willingness to let go of things that maybe successful now but are destined to be failures in the future.
