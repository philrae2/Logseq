- **Note:**
	 - Don't get stuck thinking only in the first order. Consider the domino effect of your decision making. Apply multi-order thinking to as many aspects of your decisions, not only the outcomes, but also stakeholders, internal and external motivators.

	 - Consider the complexity of the problem and conduct a proper uncertainty and risk analysis. Be extra careful when we have high uncertainty found in the system(s).
