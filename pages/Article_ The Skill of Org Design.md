	- Organisational design is a design problem. Like all design problems, the nature of the problem is a search for¬†form-context fit.
		- In other words, you are attempting to find some ‚Äòform‚Äô (an org ‚Äòshape‚Äô, or a combination of systems, processes, and culture) that allows you to achieve some set of goals, given the specific constraints in which the org operates (the ‚Äòcontext‚Äô).
		- Organizations are complex adaptive systems comprised of social, cultural, and economic system incentives. As humans, we cannot predict individual responses to specific incentive with perfect accuracy. The nature of org design requires that we iterate our approach based on the observed behaviors.
		- The other challenge in org design is the constant prevention of the org deteriorating into a dysfunctional state. Since it is very difficult to undo bad culture‚Äîfar more challenging than it is to shape good culture‚Äîit's best to avoid altogether. It's best to monitor for nascent bad behavior.
	- Four skills needed for effective iteration
		- You have to be good with people. More precisely: you must have a good model of the people inside the org.
		- You have the ability to think in systems. In the context of org design, what this means is that you have some ability to predict how changes in your org affects the behaviour of its members. (This ability doesn‚Äôt have to be perfectly accurate, of course. That‚Äôs what the iteration is for.)
		- You have a decent understanding of the three modes of organisational control and how they interact with each other. When I say ‚Äòmodes of control‚Äô I am using terminology from the late Intel CEO Andy Grove; these are a) economic incentives, b) ‚Äòcontractual‚Äô obligations, and c) culture. These three tools make up your org design toolbox.
		- Finally, you should have the ability to introduce changes in the org, and you should know how to get them to take.
	- People
		- I have never met an org designer who is bad with people.
		- People skills are necessary for two reasons: first, you need to have a working model of the people who make up your org, in order to predict how they might react to org changes (which is skill number 2, above). Second, being good with people means that you are able to get your org changes to take (this is skill number 4, above). In practice, this looks like an ability to predict which people might resist the org change, and how, and therefore allows you to do targeted interventions to prevent such resistance from occurring.
	- Systems Thinking
		- Systems thinking means a particular thing here: you are able to predict how people are going to respond to incentives.
		- I mean incentives broadly: there are psychological and status incentives, created by the structure of your org and the people in it, and there are also economic incentives, that fall out of your promotion and compensation policies. Good org designers are able to model how changes to these structures and policies might play out. This doesn‚Äôt mean that they have perfect prediction ‚Äî we're dealing with a complex adaptive system, after all ‚Äî but it¬†__does__¬†mean that when a new org behaviour emerges, perhaps as a result of some policy change made months in the past, they are able to notice the behaviour and know how to act on it (either by reinforcing it or changing it).
		- This is, incidentally, a key behavior that good org designers focus on. Organizations have memory ‚Äî if an org gets into a dysfunctional state, the dynamics can be ridiculously difficult to reverse. So one aspect of org design is to notice when such regressions are happening, and to fix it ‚Äî or, if not immediately possible ‚Äî to keep track of the regression before it becomes too painful to undo.
	- The Three Modes of Organisational Control
		- In¬†__High Output Management__, Andy Grove argues **that there are really only three forms of organizational control**:
			- **Economic incentives** (what Grove calls ‚Äòfree-market forces‚Äô) ‚Äî for instance when you purchase something for a price, or take economically motivated action with your self-interests in mind.
			- **Contractual obligations** ‚Äî when you stop for a traffic light, or work within prescribed roles in a company ‚Äî say, if you are in marketing, and you have to work with sales (Hubspot sales leader Mark Roberge calls this ‚Äòthe sales-marketing service level agreement‚Äô, which is usually implicit in most companies).
			- **Culture** ‚Äî when you are influenced by ‚Äòthis is the way we do things here.‚Äô
		- **These three forms of organizational control make up the org design toolbox**. Grove presents the following illustration in¬†__HOM__, and then writes:
		- ![](https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2021/10/00023.jpeg)
			- There is a temptation to idealize what I‚Äôve called cultural values as a mode of control because it is so ‚Äúnice,‚Äù even utopian, because everybody presumably cares about the common good and subjugates self-interest to that common good. But this is not the most efficient mode of control under all conditions. It is no guide to buying tires, nor could the tax system work this way.¬†Accordingly, **given a certain set of conditions, there is always a most appropriate mode of control, which we as managers should find and use**¬†__(emphasis mine)__.
				- **How do we do that? There are two variables here: first, the nature of a person‚Äôs motivation; and second, the nature of the environment in which he works.**
				- **An imaginary composite index can be applied to measure an environment‚Äôs complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity, which we‚Äôll call the CUA factor. **

					- Cindy, the process engineer, is surrounded by tricky technologies, new and not fully operational equipment, and development engineers and production engineers pulling her in opposite directions. Her working environment, in short, is¬†__complex__. Bruce, the marketing manager, has asked for permission to hire more people for his grossly understaffed group; his supervisor waffles, and Bruce is left with no idea if he‚Äôll get the go-ahead or what to do if he doesn‚Äôt. Bruce‚Äôs working environment is¬†__uncertain__. Mike, whom we will now introduce as an Intel transportation supervisor, had to deal with so many committees, councils, and divisional manufacturing managers that he didn‚Äôt know which, if any, end was up. He eventually quit, unable to tolerate the¬†__ambiguity__¬†of his working environment.
		- The corollary to Grove‚Äôs observation is that **org designers must choose between economic incentives, structural and policy changes, or culture when they want to shape organizational behavior**. Picking the right tool for the job is a bit of an art.
			- I‚Äôll give you an example. At one point when I was running the Vietnam office, I realized that I had inherited a distinctively bro culture ‚Äî a culture of lewd jokes and sexist remarks. I realized that if we wanted to hire women, we would have to change the culture. (To be fair, this was in Vietnam, with very different cultural mores, but it made no difference to my goals).
			- How should I change this behavior? I could have introduced an economic incentive (implement a fine for every lewd joke, or make it part of the conditions for promotion). I could have introduced a new policy (no more lewd jokes, or else!) Or I could use the subtle influence of culture. I decided on the latter.
			- During a morning stand-up, I explained that many of us wanted more women in the company (which was true) and that one thing that made this difficult to do was that we had a culture that made women uncomfortable (probably true, though it was more complex than that). I told my team that going forward, we were not allowed to make lewd jokes, or even share sexist memes. Then I watched the company chat for the inevitable slip-up. My response to the few slip-ups over the next month were simple: I would reply to the message with a ‚Äònot cool‚Äô. And I may have engineered a situation where I made a sexist joke in front of the entire office, stopped, called myself out very seriously, apologized, and then moved on. My goal was to make a very public example of myself. This is not a general recommendation, by the way ‚Äî more something I thought would work in the context.
			- I was right ‚Äî it took only a month for the new behavior to take.
	- The Ability to Get Org Changes to Take
		- This leads us to the final sub-skill: **you need to know how to get org changes to take¬†__for your particular org._**_
		- Getting new org changes to take can be rather tricky. I can spend a whole blog post writing about this single skill ‚Äî and I acknowledge that I‚Äôm not even very good at it. But to sort of give you a taste for what this looks like, I‚Äôll walk you through a number of challenges that good org designers know to navigate.
		- For starters, if you introduce a big org change and screw up the initial implementation, the org may collectively reject the change ‚Ä¶ forever. (‚ÄúYeah, we tried that. It didn‚Äôt work. We‚Äôre never doing that again.‚Äù)
		- Figuring out a way to avoid this dynamic is a huge chunk of the skill.
		- When I was running the hacker club, my nickname amongst core team members was ‚Äòcat herder‚Äô. This was actually quite accurate ‚Äî if I wanted to introduce an org change, I knew exactly who in the team would protest the change, how they might register their protest, and therefore how I might nullify their opposition. (I should note that I used this power judiciously ‚Äî obviously this was a two-way street; core team members could just as often change my opinion. I‚Äôm just stating it like this because I knew I had an ability to push changes through ‚Äî and any org designer would say the same; I could do this either by changing their opinion, or moulding the majority opinion to go over them ‚Äî basically, I was herding cats).
		- Often, I would only institute some change after laying the seeds for consensus weeks or months in advance.
		- This approach isn‚Äôt generalisable, of course. When running the Vietnam office, we had many other business-related problems to deal with; building consensus wasn‚Äôt something that I always had the time to do. So the way I ran certain org changes was to:
			- Get a sense for team receptivity for that org change, balanced against the necessity of the org change. If I sensed that the team would be resistant to the change, I would:
			- Figure out how much I had left in the ‚Äòcredibility/trust‚Äô bank, and if I wanted to burn that capital.
			- If possible, find a smaller, more reversible version of the org change to introduce first.
			- Use disasters to my full advantage (people are usually more receptive to trying new ways of doing things in the wake of something painful).
			- Strategically allow certain things to blow up so that I could exploit the pain to introduce org change, as per 4) above.
			- Or build consensus; consensus was always the best, if most time consuming, option.
		- I would also take extra time doing 1-on-1s right after we introduced a change. I learnt this the hard way: after introducing a new task estimation process, I did no check-ins for a couple of weeks. Then I learnt, in the following month's 1-on-1s, that multiple employees were unhappy with the way the implementation was playing out, and I was at risk of having total process rejection. I spent the good part of the next three weeks tweaking the process to save it.
		- All of this, I might add, was mostly intuitive; I had, by then, a good grasp of the org dynamics of my company.
		- I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm particularly skilled at this. I believe that I was just good enough for the context that I found myself in. To a certain extent, this skill overlaps with org politics, and I‚Äôm sure others are better at playing organisational politics than I ever was ‚Äî just as I'm aware that navigating org politics is a bigger thing in larger companies.
		- And of course I‚Äôve gotten a huge amount of value from other org design experts. Here‚Äôs John Cutler, for instance, who has a useful framework for experimentation (read: introducing new org changes)¬†[here](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-3453-better-experiments):
		- Here‚Äôs a tool/activity I have been using recently to help teams design internally-focused (non product) experiments.
		- During the pandemic, teams are running experiments to counter burnout and to adapt to remote-work. Hopefully, this activity can help your team design better experiments.
		- My general observation is that teams either 1) don‚Äôt really think through their experiments or 2) are overly biased to certain types of experiments. An organization might always try highly localized, low-risk experiments, yet never figure out how to ‚Äúscale‚Äù those experiments. Or, an org might turn every experiment into a big-bang, long duration program.![](https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/10/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_f43bcead-de17-447c-8dab-f7cd85a689d6_2206x1246.png)
		- Cutler‚Äôs activity forces teams to pick experiments that are safer first, before gradually iterating towards changes that are more disruptive to the company (that is, ticks more boxes to the right side of the diagram above as opposed to the left side).
		- Cutler is an expert at org setups; I‚Äôd defer to him whenever possible.
	- What Does Mastery Look Like?
		- Now that I‚Äôve laid out the shape of the skill, we may ask a more interesting question: what do great org-designers look like? Or, stated differently: what does the skill look like at the very edges of competency?
		- Here are a couple of factors I‚Äôve been watching over the past decade:
		- Scale. In general, the larger the organisation, the more difficult the org design. This is for a few reasons:
			- It becomes harder to model the median member of the org, thanks to increased size.
			- It becomes harder to observe changes in organisational behaviour in response to policy changes.
			- Things take slower to spread, which means that bad org dynamics can fester for longer.
			- There are more moving parts, making the act of introducing a new org change more difficult to do (and depending on the org, more politically fraught).
		- Because the difficulty of org design increases with scale, org designers who are able to create reasonably effective organisations at scale are more skillful than org designers who have not yet done so.
		- On this note, I have only designed orgs in the 30-50 person range. I am not yet¬†[believable](https://commoncog.com/blog/believability/)¬†when it comes to larger orgs, and this is an indication of the limits of my skill.
		- More difficult contexts. Some org-design contexts are more difficult than others. Arguably, designing a university club is easier than designing a company ‚Äî for with a company you are interacting with a capital environment and a marketplace.
		- One of the reasons I find Amazon‚Äôs¬†__[Working Backwards](https://commoncog.com/blog/working-backwards/)__¬†so wonderful is that it is an example of org design for a particularly difficult context: that of a decentralised organisation designed to¬†__create business value through new business origination, not acquisition__. This is a notoriously difficult game, and¬†__Working Backwards__¬†is the story of the iteration that Bezos and company underwent to arrive at their current org setup.
		- There are other difficult contexts. For instance:
			- Koch Industries designed their org to ‚Äòdouble earnings, on average, every six years‚Äô with limited external capital. Their conglomerate design is decentralized, bulwarked through a strict enforcement of the corporate veil between subsidiaries, and managed for return on invested capital (instead of via traditional P&L). They also do interesting things with shadow equity to incentivise and reward employee performance ‚Äî and have systems in place to track and reward employees, even as they move around the conglomerate.
			- Constellation Software has¬†[designed their org](https://shomik.substack.com/p/constellation-software-and-org-design)¬†to allocate capital at scale, at an extremely high deal velocity, in as many ‚Äòvertical software companies‚Äô as possible. To achieve this, they decentralize their org into six operating groups, set a hurdle rate for investments, and then empower the groups to acquire something on the order of 100 companies, collectively, each year. This is a challenging context by any measure ‚Äî most capital allocation vehicles (be it fund or holding conglomerate) opt to move upwards in deal size over time; Constellation is unique in that it chose to focus on smaller deal sizes but at a much higher velocity than all of its competitors.
		- As you might imagine, the more challenging the context, the more difficult the org design.
			- Managing larger, more challenging tensions.¬†One of the most difficult things about building successful organizations is that all sufficiently large orgs are broken in some terrible way, and that brokenness can come back to haunt you. The way that orgs get broken is that every design choice you make exploits some inescapable organizational tension. Pushing the tension in one direction tends to result in a dysfunction in the other direction ‚Ä¶ and pushing is usually required to achieve form-context fit. The key challenge is to live with some set of acceptable dysfunctions ‚Äî which in large companies, can be quite difficult to swallow.
			- Venture Capitalist Ben Horowitz¬†[writes](https://a16z.com/2011/03/31/whats-the-most-difficult-ceo-skill-managing-your-own-psychology/):
				- If you manage a team of 10 people, it‚Äôs quite possible to do so with very few mistakes or bad behaviors. If you manage an organization of 1,000 people it is quite impossible. At a certain size, your company will do things that are so bad that you never imagined that you‚Äôd be associated with that kind of incompetence. Seeing people fritter away money, waste each other‚Äôs time, and do sloppy work can make you feel bad. If you are the CEO, it may well make you sick.
			- And to rub salt into the wound and make matters worse, it‚Äôs your fault.
			- This is pretty much what every org designer feels. At smaller scales it‚Äôs usually manageable ‚Äî I know that my previous orgs continue to reflect my values, and therefore my failures. And I‚Äôve mostly made peace with that.
			- Good org designers, however, are more likely to deal with larger organisations, which in turn means that the dysfunctions and brokenness of their designs scales up to ridiculous proportions. Nobody is really harmed if my tiny company fails to recruit women effectively. Lots of people are harmed if Amazon hires them to work in¬†[under-ventilated warehouses](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88nv7g/amazon-workers-describe-excessive-heat-fainting-in-nyc-warehouse).
			- At the higher levels of the skill, good org design demands the ability to live with such dysfunctions. You can fix some of your org‚Äôs problems, but there will always be more.
	- Second Order Implications
		- Now that we‚Äôve talked about the shape of the skill, we may discuss a number of second order implications.
		- Here‚Äôs one: it is not awfully important to study abstract incentive design, or to study theoretical treatments of Goodhart‚Äôs Law, because in truth, these are avoidable in an iterative process. No, **if you want to get good at org design, your time is better spent building more accurate models of the people in your org, in learning how they respond to incentives, and in building enough power and credibility to get your org changes to take.**
		- Holacracy is a organisational form with no consideration for context.
		- A second implication is this: **anyone who gloms onto some organisational framework without consideration for the¬†__context they operate in__¬†should be regarded as bad at org design. I** was completely unsurprised when Medium and Zappos announced that their implementations of¬†[Holacracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy)¬†had failed. Because¬†__of course__¬†it would fail ‚Äî Holacracy is a organisational form with no consideration for context.
		- A third, related implication is that adoption of org processes should¬†__always__¬†take the step-by-step iteration process into account. Or to put that another way ‚Äî when you are reading about Agile, or Scrum, or¬†[Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup), or some other business process, you should¬†__never__¬†think of it as a system to be adopted wholesale; you should always think ‚Äúhmm, this is a set of tools that seem to work for¬†__some__¬†context; how do I know this works for mine?‚Äù And then you should break those processes down to atomised pieces, and apply them by running smaller, more iterative tests.
		- Consequently, anyone who tries to shove some org process down your throat with no thought for your business‚Äôs context is probably a novice at org design. You can sort of see a pattern here: those with some experience of org design know that they cannot perfectly predict organizational behavior in response to their changes, so they iterate. Those who aren‚Äôt good at the skill think that they can get there through mechanistic adoption alone. Distrust the latter whenever possible.
		- The final implication of this essay is that¬†__stories of organisational processes are more important than descriptive how-tos of the process.__¬†A novice would read¬†__[Working Backwards](https://commoncog.com/blog/working-backwards/)__¬†or Netflix‚Äôs¬†__[No Rules Rules](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49099937-no-rules-rules)__¬†as ‚ÄúAhh, here are a handful of mechanisms these successful organisations used to become successful! If I adopt them in my org, I, too, will be successful.‚Äù
		- But this is naive.
		- An experienced org designer would read them for the stories of¬†__how those companies got to those mechanisms in the first place.__¬†The story of the iterative process is more revealing than a simple description of the mechanisms, because it tells us the context. Understanding the context is usually key to understanding if the processes have a shot at working when applied to your company.
		- If there‚Äôs one thing that you take away from this piece, let it be that.
