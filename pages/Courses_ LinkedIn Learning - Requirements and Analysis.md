	- What are elicitation and analysis
		- How do we truly know the solution we're working on is right for the stakeholders, customers, and the organization? How do we know it fits, and they'll love it? Typically, more elaboration and discovery from the original request is needed to deliver what these groups want and need.
			- That's why elicitation and analysis of requirements is critical.
				- Stakeholders have ideas, developers have ideas, everyone has ideas, but the actual needs of the customers are found in the magic of elicitation and analysis.
				- Elicitation is the discovery and progressive elaboration of understanding the needs of our stakeholders and customers.

					- The process helps the team evolve their ideas into requirements that will take a solution or product into alignment with what delights the customer and serves the organization's strategy. 
					  id:: faa073ca-8bf7-4808-ab74-49b982ee23fa
					- It involves a set of techniques that go beyond what's stated, beyond what the data says, and beyond everyone's ideas, to dig and probe deeper into what's unsaid. 
					  id:: 6b79622c-cd2c-4945-acc5-b22dfc7a4255
					- We elicit whether or not we're working on solving a defect, understanding requirements for an enhancement request, or developing a new product, service, or process. 
					  id:: 1553fa91-df75-4ded-be71-8c0a225dfbb6
					- You do this by breaking it down and looking at various angles. The angles you can examine are of a sequence, data, logical rules, the people involved, handoffs, and the various relationships that exist. It's about how they all work together to achieve the goal of the product and improve the customer experience. 
					  id:: c5954240-79e7-4725-803e-fb875fbd3f33
				- Analysis involves a combination of thinking, inspiring dialogue, and analysis with others. It involves modeling, diagramming, and documenting to bring out the various angles to ensure impact, gaps, scenarios, and connections are well understood by the team.
				- Elicitation and analysis are easy to neglect in a day filled with meetings, emails, and interruptions. What matters most is that we make the time to consciously elicit and analyze using a variety of techniques. The benefits of ensuring these critical pieces happen are far-reaching and will improve the project success and customers' experience.
	- Role of elicitation and analysis in requirements
		- If you ask most business analysts what they spend their time on, many would say a lot of documents, meetings, and emails. These activities are typically slow and low quality ways to get great requirements. 
		  id:: 87afe229-eb66-4986-95da-0977a658710f
		- Spending more time on true elicitation and analysis will lessen the time in meetings, reading through documents, and reading tedious emails. 
		  id:: b3a83a18-9f14-47fd-b956-d22bef18f986
			- Documents, emails, and traditional meetings do not help teams with this exploration, dialogue and shared understanding. 
			  id:: e0e9822d-9258-4783-adf7-8bc18236ee12
		- True elicitation and analysis is more about dialogue, shared understanding, visuals, and exploring. 
		  id:: 8156c606-876d-4410-a9d3-cccb9b318fc8
		- Elicitation is the discovery and evolution of thought for what you are building. It's about learning together as a team what is the right thing to build for the customer. 
		  id:: 43267171-fc7b-406b-bb79-79b78e385c8c
			- As a business analyst, helping the team through this process is critical. Discovering what the true needs of the customers really are not just what's been said is key.
				- Many times stakeholders are simply voicing what their needs are and the only way they know how to voice them at the time. What they need is the opportunity to evolve their thoughts, think out loud, and sit with their thoughts. They need to be able to co-create their ideas and solutions with you and with the team. And this is what elicitation is all about.

		- Analysis is analyzing the information you elicited and bringing back meaningful models, questions, conversation, and diagrams back to the team in order to elicit more. 
		  id:: a4efdd35-c267-4489-85fe-f83b0bfa6753
			- In analysis, you use various techniques to break down, some up, and organize the information interviews that help you and the team analyze. 
			  id:: 5c2ad16d-5ef6-4d80-ba94-4c7d125581ab
			- Working without doing analysis is a recipe for a lot of defects, enhancements, rework, and frustrated users. 
			  id:: be726673-5bc0-4d2d-b520-a113d50f48a0
			- We analyze things like the people who use the system and their interactions. Data, rules, and scenarios that drive user behavior and needs. And we analyze others who may be impacted. 
			  id:: b32c1971-0fd9-4157-ac6a-fa4763c2c0e5
			- Analyzing these pieces from a user point of view helps ensure that what gets built is actually satisfying to user's needs.
			- Most of our customers, users and stakeholders do not give us all this information organized in a way to answer all these questions and more. 
			  id:: 229751b1-b907-46ce-85df-bc289e4cb721
			- The analysis comes into play, as we figure out what information we have and don't have, so that we know what to ask or what to research, model, and diagram to figure it all out. 
			  id:: 020a1bfe-3ea9-4dd4-af95-0f0d05eda72e
		- Upon validating, it's common for even more information to come out that was previously unknown.
			- And this is exactly what we want. We want to be in a role that makes others think and analyze.
			- We do this until the team feels we have a shared understanding at the right level of detail to move forward. And this is the same for defects, user stories, and backlog items on agile teams or an entire product, if all the requirements are being done at one time.
		- When you have all this information, next it's critical to organize it and validate it. And this may happen all in the same meeting or conversation or perhaps be a separate conversation.
			- Without elicitation and analysis, our solutions and products are fraught with rework, defects, and the potential to frustrate our users and customers. This frustration can lead to major costs to the organization. Great elicitation and analysis is intentional and uses a variety of techniques to collaborate, research, and experiment to get to a great product.
	- Brainstorming - not recommended by other sources---is there a way to do this more effectively?
		- How can we use brainstorming for requirements?
			- When we brainstorm in a project setting, we are simply gathering a group of stakeholders to produce a whole bunch of ideas around a specific topic.
			- When you're doing it right, it inspires creative thinking, new ideas, or a new approach to a problem. Idea generation is critical for all areas of our project work.
			- We can brainstorm things like stakeholders who are impacted, features of a solution, solution options and alternatives, risks, or ways to resolve issues.
			- We can also brainstorm reactions and feelings that users might have when using the product. We can brainstorm scenarios and exception paths.
			- When brainstorming, we need to remember that an effective session requires planning and good techniques. I often use a combination of individual brainstorming and then group brainstorming.
			- I like to have a group silently think about their ideas before contributing to a larger group discussion.
				- Don't be tempted to ask your stakeholders to solo brainstorm before the meeting. Most of them won't take the time. So, just do it in the meeting.
			- Typically, I'll ask people to write down their own ideas. Then, I'll turn it into more of a group activity where the team shares their ideas with one another. Also, I love using flip charts, sticky notes, and other related supplies, so the team members can be active and anonymous when sharing their ideas and get both introverts and extroverts contributing equally. They can think and reflect individually on sticky notes.
				- Then, get together and see what everyone has in common and what's different. The team can group and or prioritize these ideas. I have an exercise file with a list of great brainstorming resources to inspire and continue your learning.
			- When done well, brainstorming can boost group dynamics, generate powerful ideas, neutralize strong personalities, and elicit requirements quickly. I hope I've inspired you to try something new.
	- Methods
		- Interviews
			- If you had an interview for your dream job, you wouldn't just wing it, right? You'd prepare, you'd research, and anticipate and follow up afterwards. Well, you should take the same approach when using interviews to elicit requirements.
			- Interviews are an extremely common elicitation technique and no doubt you're already using them, but are they as effective as they could be?
				- ^^I'd like to look at interviews as either a relationship building tool or a deeper dive into the details of someone's domain or scope of work. ^^
				- You can find value in interviewing almost anyone associated with the project like sponsors, subject matter experts, business managers, customers, and users.
				- But your interviews should be strategic, helping you build or smooth relationships with key stakeholders or eliciting details in areas of complexity.
				- ^^To create high-impact interviews, I break each interview into three steps, prepare, conduct, and follow up. When preparing for the interview, I start by thinking about who I'm interviewin^^g.
				- I think about their role and how I can make a personal connection with them. Don't underestimate the power of relationship building. It can be absolutely critical to getting the details you need later.
				- **It's also really important to think about your goal for the interview. **
					- Is it relationship building, understanding detailed information, or perhaps more thought provoking to evolve the solution concepts?
				- ^^As I prepare questions, I always include two tiers, engaging questions that open up the dialogue, and probing questions that elicit more detail. ^^
				- So now it's time to think about conducting the interview. I like to take some time to build a little rapport before getting to the heart of the interview, using those personal connection points I thought about in advance.
					- Typically, I have three to five questions prepared for a 60-minute interview.
					- I'll ask a few engaging questions and then some probing questions, always trying to maintain a conversational cadence and flow that's not too rigid or structured.
					- Taking extensive notes can really wreck the flow. So at most, I create a framework of reminder bullets instead of trying to capture every single word they say.
				- Next is the interview follow-up. It's a key piece of the interviewing that's often skipped.
					- ^^I touch base after an interview to make sure I've captured key points correctly. ^^
						- Don't ask your interviewee to review pages of notes, but instead ask them to clarify and validate a few important pieces of information.
						- ^^I also like to meet up and have them review a visual model I created based on my understanding of the details I heard.^^ If you want to learn even more about creating and conducting interviews for requirements, please take a look at my course requirements elicitation interviews.
						- **It's dedicated to this critical technique. Interviewing stakeholders is about building relationships and evolving ideas into great solutions.**
		- Observation
			- Observation, sometimes called job shadowing, is a great technique that I have used so many times in my career on various projects with amazing results.
				- I always find new information that challenges my assumptions, and learn things I could have never guessed. It's one that requires a significant investment of time, but always worth it.
				- When applying this technique, you don't just watch people use the product or system. You are actually looking at how they go about the task, what problem they're trying to solve, and the emotions that they have.
				- You're also looking for any thought processes that are being used in parallel. What are they thinking about while using the product, or what internal decisions are they making as they move through using the product or system?
				- It also helps to look for any tools they are using outside the product or system, and to determine if the system is working as expected.
				- There are basically two types of observation we can do: passive and active.
					- When using passive observation, we don't interact with the user. We try to understand the process they use, and their emotions. We want to learn what is frustrating for them, and what is delighting them.
						- And we do this by not talking or interacting with them. Passive observation is great in terms of taking less time from the user, or perhaps they do not even know you're watching. If they are aware you're watching or observing, it can make them nervous. So we have to be careful about that relationship, and make sure they're not changing their behavior because someone's watching.
					- When doing active observation, we actually are working with the user. We ask questions during the process to better understand or confirm what we are seeing. Active observation takes a lot longer and interrupts the user. The results might be more accurate or less accurate depending on the context and on the person you're observing. You might get a super user, an average user, or perhaps a struggling user, and sometimes it's hard to tell which group you're observing. If you think the findings would vary dramatically based on the user type, it's a good practice to observe users at other skill levels as well.
				- When observing, no matter if it's passive or active, some of the things you want to look out for are what feelings does the user have using the system? When are they using knowledge other than what's in the product they're working with? Are they using knowledge from another system, a piece of paper, or making a decision based on knowledge already in their heads? And when are they making these decisions, and what influences them? You'll be surprised by what you learn from observation. Typically our users and customers do not use the product the way we think they do. Find some time in your process for observation, and see how it can improve the quality of your requirements.
		- Expirements
			- Sometimes people don't know what they don't know. They have blind spots due to complexity, ambiguity, or just plain uncertainty about the future. This is increasingly common in today's business and technology landscape. If your team is struggling with blind spots, try experimenting.
				- It's the best technique to pull out when your team needs clarity and needs to learn something to move forward. Experimenting is about learning the unknown, testing ideas, assumptions, and key theories that drive requirements for products and systems. We identify what we want to learn more about and design an experiment to bring the team the needed information. Experimenting helps teams get through the times when requirements are hard to get at or on the other side of the equation, requirements keep changing. When you see one of these patterns happening, it may be time to recommend and plan an experiment. To plan an experiment, first, we need to know what we want to learn. What information could we gather that would help the team make decisions? For example, let's say that we're an online retailer struggling with decisions around the redesign of shipping options as part of our checkout function. The team can't decide how many options to present to the user, or if the estimated arrival date is accurate enough to warrant displaying. An experiment may help the team make these decisions. We know that we want to learn the optimum number of shipping options to present. In our experiment, we could try a few different options to the customers and see what works. We could look at how long a customer spends selecting the shipping option and how long and how often they change their mind after selecting one. Comparing the results may lead the team to make a decision. For the question about the accuracy of arrival dates. We could compare the data of estimated and actual arrival dates. If they're way off target, we could modify the process or algorithm that estimates arrival dates and retest until we improve accuracy enough to be comfortable sharing the estimated date with the user. The key to experimenting is to isolate exactly what you want to learn. Design your experiment to minimize the impact outside of your precise learning area. Experiments are powerful and can get teams real-time information that shines a spotlight on the true needs and requirements of users. Experiment with experiments. Find your blind spots and give your team the clarity they need to make good decisions and move the project forward.
