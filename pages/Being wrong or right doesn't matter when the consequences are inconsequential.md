- **Note:**
	 - Often we are paralyzed by thinking too much about the inconsequential outcomes of being wrong. We may fear embarrassment and think too highly of what others think about us. This can result in missed opportunities for learning as a result of preserving our egos.

	 - Others make this decisions and if we defer to their framework we indirectly adopt this fear.
