- tags: #zettel #failure #success

- Description
	 - People are quick too blame themselves for failure and many organizations are terrible at handling/supporting failures with their employees. 
		 - Many organizations lack the vision to see failure as necessary for innovation

	 - We can prepare to handle failure by redefining realistic meanings for failure and success. If failure and success are not defined realistically then we are setting up ourselves for failure.

	 - Success should be attainable even if the desired outcome is not what we want. The world is largely out of our controlâ€”success and its definition should keep that in mind. 

	 - #goals We can set approach goals, not avoidance goals
		 - Goals are categorized as approach goals or avoidance goals depending if the are something we want to attain or avoid. It is better for us psychologically to set approach goals or reframe avoidance goals as approach goals.

		 - Research shows employees who take on avoidance goals or focus on avoiding a problem are twice as likely to burn out, become mentally fatigued  compared to approached focused people.

	 - #fear Create a fear list: Fear setting is confronting our fears and their realistic outcomes
		 - We write our the the worst, yet realistic cases or scenarios (outcomes)

		 - Things we do to prevent failure

		 - Write down the benefits of the attempted effort to act on a goal and the cost of inaction

	 - Focus on [[learning]]
		 - Not all experiences will end with the outcome we wanted but we can wring out the most knowledge out of them

		 - We should be fearful when we feel too comfortable, it means we're not stepping out of our comfort zones to take the steps that will help you rise and thrive.
