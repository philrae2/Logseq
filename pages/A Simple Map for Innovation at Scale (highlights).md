	- However, when *all* of the requirements are handed to the action teams this way the assumption is that the problems have been validated, and the teams do not need to do any further exploration of the problem space themselves.
	  
	  Those tight bounds on requirements constrain the ability of the topic area action teams to:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   Deeply understand the *problems* ‚Äì who are the customers, internal stakeholders (sales, other departments) and beneficiaries (shareholders, etc.)? How to adjudicate between them, priority of the solution, timing of the solutions, minimum feature set, dependencies, etc.
	  ‚Ä¢   Figure out whether the problem is a symptom of something more important
	  ‚Ä¢   Understand whether the problem is immediately solvable, requires multiple minimum viable products to test several solutions, or needs more R&D ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4cgkyqy36gmqy5x18y6w1ye))
	- I noticed that with all of the requirements fixed upfront, instead of having a freedom to innovate, the topic area action teams had become extensions of existing product development groups. They were getting trapped into existing mindsets and were likely producing far less than they were capable of. This is a common mistake corporate innovation teams tend to make. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4chs893s663xqg92rqeygr9))
	- I reminded them that when team members get out of their buildings and comfort zones, and directly talk to, observe, and interact with the customers, stakeholders and beneficiaries, it allows them to be agile, and the solutions they deliver will be needed, timely, relevant and take less time and resources to develop. It‚Äôs the difference between admiring a problem and solving one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4chsm3kwzvreys0evtv2kts))
	- **Give the Topic Areas a Common Framework  
	  **I asked John and Avika if they had considered offering the topic action team leaders and their team members a simple conceptual framework (one picture) and common language. I suggested this would allow the teams to know when and how to ‚Äúideate‚Äù and incorporate innovative ideas that accelerate better outcomes. The framework would use the initial corporate strategy requirements as a starting point rather than a fixed destination. See the diagram.
	  
	  I drew them a simple chart and explained that most problems start in the bottom right box.
	  
	  [![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp\-content/uploads/2022/10/Validating\-problems.jpg?fit=468%2C248&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp\-content/uploads/2022/10/Validating\-problems.jpg?ssl=1)
	  
	  These are ‚Äúunvalidated‚Äù problems. Teams would use a customer discovery process to validate them. (At times some problems might require more R&D before they can be solved.) Once the problems are validated, teams move to the box on the bottom left and explore multiple solutions. *Both boxes on the bottom are where ideation and innovation\-type of problem/solution brainstorming are critical*. At times this can be accelerated by bringing in the horizon 3, out\-of\-the\-box thinkers that every company has, and let them lend their critical eye to the problem/solution.
	  
	  If a solution is found and solves the problem, the team heads up to the box on the top left. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4chttb5600ww9w3ep18v413))

	- But I explained that very often the solution is unknown. In that case think about having the teams do a ‚Äútechnical terrain walk.‚Äù This is the process of describing the problem to multiple sources (vendors, internal developers, other internal programs) debriefing on the sum of what was found. A terrain walk often discovers that the problem is actually a symptom of another problem or that the sources see it as a different version of the problem. Or that an existing solution already exists or can be modified to fit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4cwkjfpgw6gze4cd6azvqk0))
	- But often, no existing solution exists. In this case, teams could head to the box on the top right and build Minimal Viable Products ‚Äì the smallest feature set to test with customers and partners. This MVP testing often results in new learnings from the customers, beneficiaries, and stakeholders ‚Äì for example, they may tell the topic developer that the first 20% of the deliverable is ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù or the problem has changed, or the timing has changed, or it needs to be compatible with something else, etc. Finally, when a solution is wanted by customers/beneficiaries/stakeholders and is technically feasible, then the teams move to the box on the top left.

	- Topic action teams need to deeply understand the problems as the customer understands them, not just what the corporate strategy requirements dictate
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   This can‚Äôt be done without talking directly to the customers, internal stakeholders, and partners ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4cwm8q3jmvh96n5gstjbwj8))
	- ‚Ä¢   Consider if the corporate strategy team should be more facilitators than gatekeepers
	  ‚Ä¢   A light\-weight way to keep topic teams in sync with corporate strategy is to offer a common innovation language and problem and solution framework ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4cwmjwxca7cfsbhbv06yphr))
