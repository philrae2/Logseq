- Gain [[specific knowledge]] so that society can't replace you
	 - Specific knowledge is knowledge you can't be trained for

	 - It is knowledge that is found by being [[genuine]] and following your [[curiosity]] and [[passion]] rather than whatever is hot right now
		 - If you're not 100 percent into it, somebody else who is 100 percent into it will [[outperform]] you. #committed
			 - Escape [[competition]] through [[authenticity]], when you find yourself competing with people it's because you're [[copying]] them, you're trying to do the same thing. 
				 - Play to your unique [[passions]], [[skills]], and [[talent]]s. Every human is [[different]]. 

				 - [[Art]] is doing something for its own sake and you end up doing your [[[[best]] work]]

			 - Don't [[obsess]] and want [[success]], [[wealth]], or a great future that the actions you take become [[unnatural]]

	 - Building specific knowledge will feel [[fun]] and [[playful]] but will look like [[work]] for others

	 - There is no [[skill]] called [[business]]. Avoid [[business]] magazines and business [[classes]].
		 - The most important skill for getting [[rich]] is becoming a [[perpetual learner]]

		 - Knowing how to be [[persuasive]] when [[speaking]] is more important than being an expert markerter

		 - You can only achieve [[mastery]] in one or two things in life, it's usually things you're obsessed about
			 - When you find the 1% of things that make up your life that you truly are [[interest]]ed in, go all in and [[ignore]] the other 99%

		 - Learn the skill of earning people's [[trust]], that's how CEOs and leaders are where they are (of course dependent on the industry)
			 - They are trusted because of the [[relationships]] they've built and the work they've done has [[compounded]]. 

	 - Study [[microeconomics]], [[game theory]], [[psychology]], [[ethics]], [[mathematics]] and [[computers]]

- Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true. 

- [[Intentions]] don't matter, [[actions]] do, that's why being [[ethical]] is so hard.

- When you find the right thing to do, and find the people to work with, [[invest]] in them and the work deeply. [[Stick]]ing to it for decades is how you make the big [[returns]] in your relationships and in money. 

- [[earn]] money with your [[mind]], not your [[time]]
	 - To be [[paid]] for your [[knowledge]] and [[Decision Making]], be better at those [[skill]]s
		 - Gain [[credibility]] on your [[judgment]]s. Judgment especially demonstrated judgment, with high [[accountability]] and a clear track record is [[critical]]

		 - We [[waste]] our [[time]] with [[short-term]] [[thinking]] and [[busywork]].

- Being [[anti-[[wealth]]]] will prevent you from becoming wealthy, because you will not have the right [[mindset]] for it, won't have the right [[spirit]], and won't be dealing with people on the right level. Be [[optimistic]], be [[positive]]. [[Optimist]]s do better in the long run. 

- Avoid [[status]] games in life because they make you an [[angry]], [[combative]] person. Status games requires that for someone to [[win]] someone has to [[lose]]. 
	 - You're always [[fighting]] to put other people down, to put yourself and the people like you up. 

- The way to get out of [[competition]] trap is to be [[authentic]], to find the thing you know how to do better than anybody. You know how to do it better because you [[love]] it, and no one can [[compete]] with you, because you're being yourself. If you [[love ]] to do it, be authentic, and then figure out how to map that to what society actually wants. Apply some [[leverage]] and put your name on it. 
	 - Build your [[character]] in a certain way, then your character and [[reputation]] will make people want to work with you.
		 - If you are [[trusted]], [[reliable]], high-[[integrity]], and [[long-term]] [[thinking]] dealmaker, when other people want to do deals but don't know how to do them in a [[trustworthy]] manner with strangers, they will approach you.

		 - Your character and reputation are things you can [[build]], which you can take [[advantage]] to create [[opportunities]].

- [[Business [[networking]]]] is a complete [[waste]] of time, if you're [[building]] something [[interesting]], you will always have more people who will want to know you. Trying to build business [[relationship]]s in advance of doing business is a complete waste of time. 
	 - Show your craft, practice your craft, and the right people will eventually find you. 

- [[Judgment]]
	 - [[hard work]] is [[overrated]], how hard you work matters a lot less in the modern economy. Judgment is [[underrated]]

	 - [[Wisdom]] is knowing the [[long-term]] [[consequence]]s of your [[action]]s.
		 - Wisdom applied to external problems is judgment. You have to put in the time, ([[hard work]]) but judgment is more important. 

	 - The [[smart]] thinkers are [[clear [[thinker]]s]], they are able to explain difficult concepts in simple terms. They [[understand]] the basics at a [[fundamental]] level. #[[First Principles Thinking]]
		 - Clear thinkers appeal to their own [[authority]]
