- #[[Reference Notes]]
	- Don‚Äôt ask your boss to run interference, cover for you, or take the blame. Instead, create moments where your boss can happily take credit. Once that cycle begins, you can be sure it will continue.

	- 2. Understand that there‚Äôs a difference between the right answer and the answer you can [[sell]].
	- 3.^^ Focus on making changes that work down, not up. Interacting with customers and employees is often easier than influencing bosses and investors. Over time, as you create an environment where your insight and generosity pay off, the people above you will notice, and you‚Äôll get more freedom and authority.^^
	- 4. ^^If you actually work for an organization that insists you be mediocre, that enforces conformity in all its employees, why stay? What are you building? The work can‚Äôt possibly be enjoyable or challenging, your skills aren‚Äôt increasing, and your value in the marketplace decreases each day you stay there. And if history is a guide, your job there isn‚Äôt as stable as you think, because average companies making average products for average people are under huge strain.^^
	- 5. Humility permits us to approach a problem with kindness and not arrogance.
	- Linchpins do two things for the organization. They exert emotional labor and they make a map. Those contributions take many forms. Here is one way to think about the list of what makes you indispensable: 
	  id:: 5784dae1-b88b-4ec9-afdf-1ab4a55eeec3
		- 1. Providing a unique interface between members of the organization 
		  id:: daf641fb-c0ed-4b2b-abe5-928243540f2d
		- 2. Delivering unique creativity 
		  id:: 29b7f3f0-c2e0-476f-b0fc-d8f55487f69a
		- 3. Managing a situation or organization of great complexity 
		  id:: 90a26b97-d997-4443-852b-721b83c5ba4e
		- 4. Leading customers 
		  id:: 90453c37-881a-462e-99e1-61a70faa2337
		- 5. Inspiring staff 
		  id:: 9c654efe-0113-4907-929c-dd8d2cbcf1bf
		- 6. Providing deep domain knowledge 
		  id:: a27ca54b-d637-4204-bba3-3acbd1fe2707
		- 7. Possessing a unique talent
		  id:: 1a8fd331-fd47-49b8-8ecc-97f25e454d42
	- 8. ^^Be Genuine: The people you work with won‚Äôt change if you don‚Äôt believe. The communication of enthusiasm and connection and leadership starts with the gift you give, not with the manipulation you attempt.^^ #Leadership
		- 9. Genuine gifts, given with the right intent and a respectful posture, meet our sniff test. All our senses are on alert, and the giver passes the test. We believe.
		- 10. The only successful way to live in a world of honest signals is to give the genuine gift.
			- 11. Virtually all of us make our living engaging directly with other people. When the interactions are genuine and transparent, they usually work. When they are artificial or manipulative, they fail.
			- 12. You might be parroting the words from that negotiation book or the public-speaking training you went to, but every smart person you encounter knows that you‚Äôre winging it or putting us on.
			- 13. When your boss gives you a script to read, or when you crib something from a how-to book, it almost never works. That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre not telling the truth, you‚Äôre not being human, and you‚Äôre not being transparent.
	- 14. the individual in the organization who collects, connects, and nurtures relationships is indispensable.
	- 15.^^ most psychologists agree that there are five traits that are essential in how people look at us: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extra-version, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability.^^
	- 16. Do you know someone who is more open to new ideas or more agreeable than you? More stable or extroverted? More conscientious? If so, then you better get moving. It‚Äôs so easy to fall into the trap of focusing on using a spreadsheet or a time clock to measure your progress, but in fact, **it‚Äôs the investment you make in your interactions that will pay off**.
	- 17. I‚Äôm not proposing that you become immune to feedback. In fact, the most generous thing you can do is open yourself to the feedback that improves your art and helps it spread. Discerning the difference between feedback that helps and criticism that degrades, though, will take some time.
	- 18. What will make someone a linchpin is not a shortcut. It‚Äôs the understanding of which hard work is worth doing.
	- 20. **Nothing about becoming indispensable is easy. If it‚Äôs easy, it‚Äôs already been done and it‚Äôs no longer valuable. **
	- Real change rarely comes from the front of the line. It happens from the middle or even the back. **Real change happens when someone who cares steps up and takes what feels like a risk. People follow because they want to, not because you can order them to.**
	  id:: e96b0e65-9c24-4d70-afba-7373b9f143d8
		- Linchpins don‚Äôt need authority. It‚Äôs not part of the deal. Authority matters only in the factory, not in your world.
		- 23. One day, Binny Thomas stood up. She stood up, spoke up, and started doing a new job. She didn‚Äôt leave her organization, didn‚Äôt even get a new title or new responsibilities. Instead, she started doing her old job in a new way. Binny stopped going to meetings with the goal of finding deniability or problems to avoid. Instead, she started leaning in and seeking out projects where she could make a difference.
	- 24. **Here‚Äôs the truth that you have to wrestle with: the reason that art (writing, engaging, leading, all of it) is valuable is precisely why I can‚Äôt tell you how to do it. If there were a map, there‚Äôd be no art, because art is the act of navigating without a map.**
	- ^^The linchpin has figured out that we get only a certain number of brain cycles to spend each day. Spending even one on a situation out of our control has a significant opportunity cost. Your competition is busy allocating time to create the future, and you are stuck wishing the world was different. ^^**We‚Äôre attached to a certain view, a given outcome, and when it doesn‚Äôt appear, we waste time mourning the world that we wanted that isn‚Äôt here.**
	  id:: 25d4245e-3ee0-43ea-ab42-6b297eed774f
	- 26. Smart organizations seek out people with the ability to see the world as it actually is. But that skill is worthless if you don‚Äôt acknowledge the truth and share it.
	- 27. A brilliant negotiator does her art by understanding the other side as honestly as anyone can. Only by seeing the world through clear eyes can she possibly craft a negotiation strategy that works for everyone.
	- 28. Artists can‚Äôt get attached to the object of their attention. The attachment to a worldview changes an artist‚Äôs relationship to what‚Äôs happening and prevents him from converting what he sees or interacts with into something that belongs to him, that he can work with and change.
	- Scarcity creates value, and what‚Äôs scarce is a desire to accept what is and then work to change it for the better, not deny that it exists.
	  id:: 7a9feba4-02d8-417a-868d-d580d051bbe4
	- 30. The market doesn‚Äôt care about your defense. It cares about working with someone who can accurately see what was, what is, and where things are headed. When you see a bump up ahead, do you say, ‚ÄúOh my god we‚Äôre doomed!‚Äù or do you say, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that interesting?‚Äù
	- 31. When our responses turn into reactions and we set out to teach people a lesson, we lose. We lose because the act of teaching someone a lesson rarely succeeds at changing them, and always fails at making our day better, or our work more useful.
	- 32. We assign motivations and plots and vendettas where there are none. Those angry customers didn‚Äôt wake up this morning deciding to ruin your day, not at all. They‚Äôre just angry. It‚Äôs not personal and it‚Äôs not rational and it certainly isn‚Äôt about whether or not you deserve it. It just is. So now what are you going to do about it?
	- 33. people in organizations handle their interactions as though they are in charge of teaching people a lesson. We make policies and are vindictive and focus on the past because we worry that if we don‚Äôt, someone will get away with it.
	- 34. If you accept that human beings are difficult to change, and embrace (rather than curse) the uniqueness that everyone brings to the table, you‚Äôll navigate the world with more bliss and effectiveness. And make better decisions, too.
	- 35. So the manager and the investor seek out an employee with discernment, the ability to see things as they truly are.
	- 36. You can‚Äôt make a map unless you can see the world as it is. You have to know where you are and know where you‚Äôre going before you can figure out how to go about getting there.
	- 37. So many times we want someone to tell us exactly what to do, and so many times that‚Äôs exactly the wrong approach.
	- What does it take to lead? The key distinction is the ability to forge your own path, to discover a route from one place to another that hasn‚Äôt been paved, measured, and quantified.
	  id:: d5d1a7dc-e1e5-42fc-a1e5-b2704b4598ea
	- ^^You must become indispensable to thrive in the new economy. The best ways to do that are to be remarkable, insightful, an artist, someone bearing gifts. To lead. The worst way is to conform and become a cog in a giant system.^^
	  id:: aebb44b6-f294-466c-a12e-81ef22f20aec
	- 40. Respect is the gift you can offer in return.
	- 41. what people delivering gifts seek is respect.
	- Great work is not created for everyone. If it were, it would be average work.
	  id:: ee368262-4c23-4279-8612-d5f6ddedfe7c
	- The most successful givers aren‚Äôt doing it because they‚Äôre being told to. They do it because doing it is fun. It gives them joy.
	  id:: 781e8ea6-a732-4063-8250-83db6029a542
	- 44. As big business has realized that people crave connection, not stuff, they‚Äôve tried to institutionalize it, measure it, and reward it. And they fail every time.
	- 45. A gift well received can lead to more gifts. But artists don‚Äôt give gifts for money. They do it for respect and connection and to cause change. So the best recipients are the ones who can reciprocate in kind. With honest gratitude. With clear reports about change that was created. With gifts that actually cost us, not just a tiny gratuity or faux appreciation.
	- 46. Some people think that you can‚Äôt be generous until after you become a success. They argue that they have to get theirs, and then they can go ahead and give back. The astonishing fact is that the most successful people in the world are those who don‚Äôt do it for the money.
	- 48. Artists are indispensable linchpins. Art is scarce; scarcity creates value. Gifts make tribes stronger. Organizations will always strive to replace replaceable elements with cheaper substitutes. But generous artists aren‚Äôt easily replaceable.
	- 49. These are people who were brainwashed by the last five hundred years of history, people who want to know what‚Äôs in it for them, people who believe there ain‚Äôt no such thing as a free lunch and every man for himself. These people have no art in their life because they‚Äôre unable to give a true gift. They want something in return. They want security or cash or both.
	- 50. As we‚Äôve seen, if there is no gift, there is no art. When art is created solely to be sold, it‚Äôs only a commodity.
	- 51. Generosity generates income. This works whether you are selling paintings or innovation or a service.
	- 52. While some artists get rich (J. K. Rowling got very rich), making art is not about getting rich. Art is a gift, a gift from the artist to the viewer, the listener, the user. The moment it ceases to be a gift, some of the art is lost.
	- 53. Are you giving gifts? Really and truly? Or are you so beaten down by the system, so indoctrinated by it that you can‚Äôt imagine creating art and getting closer to the people who matter to you?
	- 54. Are you giving gifts? Really and truly? Or are you so beaten down by the system, so indoctrinated by it that you can‚Äôt imagine creating art and getting
	- 55. When you walk into your boss‚Äôs office and ask for advice, she doesn‚Äôt charge you an hourly fee, even if she‚Äôs a corporate coach or a psychoanalyst, even if you want help with a personal problem. The gift of her time and attention and insight is just that‚Äîa gift. As a result, the bond between you strengthens.
	- Becoming a linchpin is not an act of selfishness. I see it as an act of generosity, because it gives you a platform for expending emotional labor and giving gifts. There are plenty of bosses who fear the idea of indispensable employees and would instead encourage you to focus on teamwork. ‚ÄúTeamwork‚Äù is the word bosses and coaches and teachers use when they actually mean, ‚ÄúDo what I say.‚Äù It‚Äôs not teamwork to stand by and do whatever the captain or the supervisor tells you to. It might be cooperative or compliant or useful, but it‚Äôs not teamwork.
	  id:: 4e5ccedc-8348-4f8c-ba55-9bded3057d81
	- 57. As soon as it is part of a system, it‚Äôs not art. Artists shake things up. They invent as they go; they respond to inputs and create surprising new outputs.
	- 58. **In the linchpin economy, the winners are once again the artists who give gifts. Giving a gift makes you indispensable. Inventing a gift, creating art‚Äîthat is what the market seeks out, and the givers are the ones who earn our respect and attention.** Shepard Fairey didn‚Äôt seek to monetize the Obama Hope poster. He gave it away with a single-minded obsession. The more copies he gave away, the closer he came to achieving his political, personal, and professional goals.
	- 59. ^^[[Anxiety]], on the other hand, is dangerous paralysis. Anxiety is the exaggeration of the worst possible what-if, accompanied by self-talk that leads to the relentless minimization of the actual odds of success. Anxiety makes it impossible to do art, because it feeds the resistance, giving the lizard brain insane power over us. It‚Äôs impossible to be a linchpin if you agree to feed your anxiety.^^
		- 60. Anxiety is needless and imaginary. It‚Äôs fear about fear, fear that means nothing. The difference between fear and anxiety: Anxiety is diffuse and focuses on possibilities in an unknown future, not a real and present threat. The resistance is 100 percent about anxiety, because humans have developed other emotions and warnings to help us avoid actual threats. Anxiety, on the other hand, is an internal construct with no relation to the outside world. ‚ÄúNeedless anxiety‚Äù is redundant, because anxiety is always needless. Anxiety doesn‚Äôt protect you from danger, but from doing great things. It keeps you awake at night and foretells a future that‚Äôs not going to happen.
	- Leo Babauta‚Äôs brilliant little book Zen Habits helps you think your way through this problem. His program is simple: Attempt to create only one significant work a year. Break that into smaller projects, and every day, find three tasks to accomplish that will help you complete a project. And do only that during your working hours. I‚Äôm talking about an hour a day to complete a mammoth work of art, whatever sort of art you have in mind. That hour a day might not be fun, but it‚Äôs probably a lot more productive than the ten hours you spend now.
	- By forcing myself to do absolutely no busywork tasks in between bouts with the work, I remove the best excuse the resistance has. I can‚Äôt avoid the work because I am not distracting myself with anything but the work. This is the hallmark of a productive artist. I don‚Äôt go to meetings. I don‚Äôt write memos. I don‚Äôt have a staff. I don‚Äôt commute. The goal is to strip away anything that looks productive but doesn‚Äôt involve shipping. It takes crazy discipline to do nothing between projects. It means that you have to face a blank wall and you can‚Äôt look busy. It means you are alone with your thoughts, and it means that a new project, perhaps a great project, will appear pretty soon, because your restless energy can‚Äôt permit you to only sit and do nothing.

	- 65. **A workaholic brings fear into the equation. She works all the time to be sure everything is all right, and she experiences resistance all the time**. She satisfies the raging fear of her lizard brain by being at the job site all the time, just to be sure.
		- I‚Äôm not a workaholic. There‚Äôs no fear because I‚Äôve ingrained the habit of shipping. The lizard brain has no chance, so it shuts up and finds something else to worry about.
	- Bre Pettis wrote this manifesto on his blog: #[[Lessons Learned]]
		- 1. There are three states of being. Not knowing, action and completion.
		- 2. Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.
		- 3. There is no editing stage.
		- 4. Pretending you know what you‚Äôre doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so accept that you know what you‚Äôre doing even if you don‚Äôt and do it.
		- 5. Banish [[procrastination]]. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
		- 6. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.
		- 7. Once you‚Äôre done you can throw it away.
		- 8. Laugh at perfection. It‚Äôs boring and keeps you from being done.
		- 9. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.
		- 10. [[Failure]] counts as done. So do [[mistakes]].
		- 11. Destruction is a variant of done.
		- 12. If you have an idea and publish it on the Internet, that counts as a ghost of done.
		- 13. Done is the engine of more.
	- 69. ‚ÄúMy boss won‚Äôt let me‚Äù‚Äîof course she won‚Äôt. Why would she? You‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúI want to do some crazy thing, and if it doesn‚Äôt work, I want you to take all the blame. Of course, if it does work, I‚Äôll get the credit. Okay?‚Äù No, not okay. Nothing in this book argues that you need the perfect boss to become indispensable.
	- ^^I‚Äôm saying that if you become indispensable, you‚Äôll discover that you get a better boss.^^
	  id:: 0357fee8-0dee-4202-a3a3-cecf8bc5437f
	- 70. ‚ÄúMy boss won‚Äôt let me‚Äù‚Äîof course she won‚Äôt. Why would she? You‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúI want to do some crazy thing, and if it doesn‚Äôt work,
	- 71. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do‚Äù‚Äîthis one is certainly true. The question is, why does that bother you? No one actually knows what to do. Sometimes we have a hunch, or a good idea, but we‚Äôre never sure. The art of challenging the resistance is doing something when you‚Äôre not certain it‚Äôs going to work.
	- 72. Confidence self-fulfills as well. If you can bring more of it to an interaction, you‚Äôre more likely to succeed, which of course creates more confidence for the next interaction. The cycle can bring you up, or it can bring you down. It‚Äôs up to you.
	- One way to become creative is to discipline yourself to generate bad ideas. The worse the better. Do it a lot and magically you‚Äôll discover that some good ones slip through.
	  id:: 634396c1-8aa0-4776-9db2-277a1fb17d5b
	- 74. Going out of your way to find uncomfortable situations isn‚Äôt natural, but it‚Äôs essential.
	- Successful people are successful for one simple reason: they think about failure differently. Successful people learn from failure, but the lesson they learn is a different one. They don‚Äôt learn that they shouldn‚Äôt have tried in the first place, and they don‚Äôt learn that they are always right and the world is wrong and they don‚Äôt learn that they are losers.
	  id:: 08e3b536-54fd-4b2b-9281-0974693a76b2
	- 76. They learn that the tactics they used didn‚Äôt work or that the person they used them on didn‚Äôt respond.
	- Being productive at someone else‚Äôs task list is not the same as making your own map.
	  id:: 7167adb7-f37e-43ef-8fbc-940eb95dd578
	- Every time you find yourself following the manual instead of writing the manual, you‚Äôre avoiding the anguish and giving in to the resistance.
	  id:: 0c5321e0-708f-438c-99c8-5363c558b28b
	- The reason that start-ups almost always defeat large companies in the rush to market is simple: start-ups have fewer people to coordinate, less thrashing, and more linchpins per square foot. They can‚Äôt afford anything else and they have less to lose. There are two solutions to the coordination problem, and both of them make people uncomfortable, because both challenge our resistance. 1. Relentlessly limit the number of people allowed to thrash. That means you need formal procedures for excluding people, even well-meaning people with authority. And you need secrecy. If you have a choice between being surprised (and watching a great project ship on time) or being involved (and participating in the late launch of a mediocre project), which do you want? You must pick one or the other.
	  id:: 32dc2636-e2e3-4322-93a2-9876a9fa608c
	- 2. Appoint one person (a linchpin) to run it. Not to co-run it or to lead a task force or to be on the committee. One person, a human being, runs it. Her name on it. Her decisions.
	  id:: 58d834a6-7b59-489c-9446-11d7a9d9793c
	- Passion is caring enough about your art that you will do almost anything to give it away, to make it a gift, to change people. Part of the passion is having the persistence and resilience to change both your art and the way you deliver it. Passion for your art also means having a passion for spreading your art. This means being willing to surrender elements that you are in love with in order to help the other parts thrive and spread. And at the same time, passion means having enough connection to your art that you‚Äôre not willing to surrender the parts that truly matter.
	  id:: 093e3bd7-f5ac-4148-8076-58dbb83b35dc
	- The job is not your work; what you do with your heart and soul is the work.
	  id:: c59a3a2d-ffd1-49fd-9ce6-f509927a49c1
	- 83. I call the process of doing your art ‚Äúthe work.‚Äù It‚Äôs possible to have a job and do the work, too. In fact, that‚Äôs how you become a linchpin. The job is not the work.
	- Your art is what you do when no one can tell you exactly how to do it. Your art is the act of taking personal responsibility, challenging the status quo, and changing people.
	  id:: e7920660-7a37-40ac-b9fd-8b532f9479c9
	- The easier it is to quantify, the less it‚Äôs worth.
	  id:: ca92e13e-07ca-4c10-8abf-06d65e8d1399
	- The core thing would be just do something awesome. Try not to get caught up in the echo chamber.
	  id:: 9965ba9a-35d5-42bf-b55b-f8054d989374
	- If you don‚Äôt pinpoint your audience, you end up making your art for the loudest, crankiest critics. And that‚Äôs a waste. Instead, focus on the audience that you choose, and listen to them, to the exclusion of all others. Go ahead and make this sort of customer happy, and the other guys can go pound sand.
	  id:: e2e2f948-701c-42e2-9505-46be539652b0
	- It‚Äôs impossible to make art for everyone. There are too many conflicting goals and there‚Äôs far too much noise. Art for everyone is mediocre, bland, and ineffective.
	  id:: 40c4361c-ce15-47c7-92e5-70cd3d8c2561
	- There are two reasons why it‚Äôs vital to know whom you are working for. The first is that understanding your audience allows you to target your work and to get feedback that will help you do it better next time. The other reason? Because it tells you whom to ignore.
	  id:: e694a51d-9361-456e-be7e-e96d2d35e976
	- But that‚Äôs a hard thing to start doing, because you‚Äôve been taught that what‚Äôs yours is yours. If you don‚Äôt have enough (and who does, say the marketers), then how can you possibly give away what you have? And yet, every day, successful people race to give away their expertise and to spread their ideas.
	  id:: 706f6fa6-2e02-4559-b743-ae662846031f
	- When you give something away, you benefit more than the recipient does. The act of being generous makes you rich beyond measure, and as the goods or services spread through the community, everyone benefits.
	  id:: 839faf3a-5bad-47c5-a503-3b9bdd6916c8
	- The alternative is to treasure what it means to do a day‚Äôs work. It‚Äôs our one and only chance to do something productive today, and it‚Äôs certainly not available to someone merely because he is the high bidder. A day‚Äôs work is your chance to do art, to create a gift, to do something that matters. As your work gets better and your art becomes more important, competition for your gifts will increase and you‚Äôll discover that you can be choosier about whom you give them to. When a day‚Äôs work does not equal a day‚Äôs pay, that means that at the end of the day, a bond is built. A gift is given and received, and people are drawn closer, not insulated from each other.

	- 93. Art is a personal gift that changes the recipient.
	- 94. An artist is an individual who creates art. The more people you change, the more you change them, the more effective your art is.
	- An artist is someone who uses bravery, insight, creativity, and boldness to challenge the status quo. And an artist takes it personally.
	- 97. Art is about intent and communication, not substances.
	- 98. The essence of any gift, including the gift of emotional labor, is that you don‚Äôt do it for a tangible, guaranteed reward. If you do, it‚Äôs no longer a gift; it‚Äôs a job. The hybrid economy we‚Äôre living in today is blending the idea of capitalism (‚Äúdo your job and I won‚Äôt fire you‚Äù) and the gift economy (‚Äúwow, this is amazing‚Äù).
	- This gulf creates tension. If you reserve your emotional labor for when you are off duty, but you work all the time, you are deprived of the joy you get when you do this labor.
	- The opportunity doesn‚Äôt necessarily feel like an opportunity. Volunteering to do emotional labor‚Äîeven when you don‚Äôt feel like it, and especially when you‚Äôre not paid extra for it‚Äîis a difficult choice. My first argument, though, is that you are paid for it. In fact, in most jobs that involve a customer, that‚Äôs all you are getting paid for.
	- Emotional labor is the task of doing important work, even when it isn‚Äôt easy. Emotional labor is difficult and easy to avoid.

	- It‚Äôs easy to find a way to spend your entire day doing busywork. Trivial work doesn‚Äôt require leaning. The challenge is to replace those tasks with rule-breaking activities instead.

	- So yes, good is bad, if bad means ‚Äúnot a profitable thing to aspire to.‚Äù And perfect is bad, because you can‚Äôt top perfect. The solution lies in seeking out something that is neither good nor perfect. You want something remarkable, nonlinear, game changing, and artistic.

	- The problem with meeting expectations is that it‚Äôs not remarkable. It won‚Äôt change the recipient of your work, and it‚Äôs easy to emulate (which makes you easy to replace). As a result of the tsunami of pretty good (and the persistence of really lousy), the market for truly exceptional is better than ever.

	- Organizations that earn dramatic success always do it in markets where asymptotes don‚Äôt exist, or where they can be shattered. If you could figure out how to bowl 320, that would be amazing. Until that happens, pick a different sport if you want to be a linchpin.
	  id:: 8c5cada5-043b-4a25-a0de-2eea14f70b79
	- Bowling is an asymptotic sport. The best you can do is perfect: 300, that‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs a ceiling. This is like the Six Sigma approach to quality. Six Sigma refers to the quest for continuous improvement, ultimately leading to 3.4 defects per million units. The problem is that once you‚Äôre heading down this road, there‚Äôs no room left for amazing improvements and remarkable innovations. Either you rolled ten strikes or you didn‚Äôt.
	- Personal interactions don‚Äôt have asymptotes. Innovative solutions to new problems don‚Äôt get old. Seek out achievements where there is no limit.

	- Emotional labor is available to all of us, but is rarely exploited as a competitive advantage. We spend our time and energy trying to perfect our craft, but we don‚Äôt focus on the skills and interactions that will allow us to stand out and become indispensable to our organization.

	- When you start down the path of beating the competition based on something that can be easily measured, you‚Äôre betting that with practice and determination, you can do better than Len Hutton or Jack Hobbs did at cricket. Not a little better, but Don Bradman better. And you can‚Äôt.

	- Troubleshooting is never part of a job description, because if you could describe the steps needed to shoot trouble, there wouldn‚Äôt be trouble in the first place, right? Troubleshooting is an art, and it‚Äôs a gift from the troubleshooter to the person in trouble. The troubleshooter steps in when everyone else has given up, puts himself on the line, and donates the energy and the risk to the cause.

	- In the face of an infinite sea of choices, it‚Äôs natural to put blinders on, to ask for a map, to beg for instructions, or failing that, to do exactly what you did last time, even if it didn‚Äôt work. Linchpins are able to embrace the lack of structure and find a new path, one that works.

	- Working without a map involves both vision and the willingness to do something about what you see.

	- Depth of knowledge is rarely sufficient, all by itself, to turn someone into a linchpin.

	- The law of linchpin leverage: The more value you create in your job, the fewer clock minutes of labor you actually spend creating that value.

	- ‚ÄúWe teach people to take initiative and become remarkable artists, to question the status quo, and to interact with transparency. And our graduates understand that consumption is not the answer to social problems.‚Äù

	- 122. Letting people in the organization use their best judgment turns out to be faster and cheaper‚Äîbut only if you hire the right people and reward them for having the right attitude. Which is the attitude of a linchpin.
	- The linchpin sees the world very differently. Exceptional insight, productivity, and generosity make markets bigger and more efficient. This situation leads to more opportunities and ultimately a payoff for everyone involved. The more you give, the more the market gives back. Abundance is possible, but only if we can imagine it and then embrace it.

	- It‚Äôs very difficult to be generous if you have this point of view. In a zero-sum game, the generous among us are fools, easily taken advantage of.
	  id:: f7576c79-f559-4f7a-8616-9c256d4bf3c1
	- On the other hand, if you believe that great talent leads to more innovation and more productivity, which then lead to more demand, generosity is the very best strategy.
	  id:: 4ee01f91-f8e8-44f2-b8ef-74427623b0c4
	- You can see your marketplace as being limited, a zero-sum game, a place where in order for one person to win, another must lose. Or you can see it as unlimited. A place where talent creates growth and the market increases in size.

	- Why are you working so hard to bury your natural-born instincts? I‚Äôve never met someone who had no art in them, though it‚Äôs buried sometimes. Markets are crying out. We need you to stand up and be remarkable. Be human. Contribute. Interact. Take the risk that you might make someone upset with your initiative, innovation, and insight‚Äîit turns out that you‚Äôll probably delight them instead.

	- The only way to get what you‚Äôre worth is to stand out, to exert emotional labor, to be seen as indispensable, and to produce interactions that organizations and people care deeply about.

	- 130. They‚Äôre bundled up against the cold, and they‚Äôre willing
	- 131. People want to be told what to do because they are afraid (petrified) of figuring it out for themselves.
	- For nearly three hundred years, that was the way work worked. What factory owners want is compliant, low-paid, replaceable cogs to run their efficient machines. Factories created productivity, and productivity produced profits. It was fun while it lasted (for the factory owners). Our society is struggling because during times of change, the very last people you need on your team are well-paid bureaucrats, note takers, literalists, manual readers, TGIF laborers, map followers, and fearful employees. The compliant masses don‚Äôt help so much when you don‚Äôt know what to do next.

	- 133. Artists are people with a genius for finding a new answer, a new connection, or a new way of getting things done. That would be you.
	- 134. What we want, what we need, what we must have are indispensable human beings. We need original thinkers, provocateurs, and people who care. We need marketers who can lead, salespeople able to risk making a human connection, passionate change makers willing to be shunned if it is necessary for them to make a point.
