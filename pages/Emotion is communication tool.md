- **Note:**
	 - We can use our emotions to communicate, but we can choose to communicate without portraying negative emotions. We can choose not to be angry, passive aggressive, or frustrated. We can choose instead to communicate positively even when we feel negative emotions.

	 - We use our behaviors as excuses for our hurtful and negative behaviors.
