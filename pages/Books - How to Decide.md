- [[resulting]] is a mental shortcut in which we use the [[quality]] of an [[outcome]] to figure out the quality of a [[decision]]
	- we are lead to make poor conclusions when we reverse engineer single outcomes to assess if a decision was goo or bad
- [[luck]] exerts its itself in the decision making process that may alter what possible outcomes you actually observe in the short run. Therefore be [[aware]] of the [[alternative histories]] that may have been possible. Keep the [[worst outcome]] in mind. #[[Books: Fooled By Randomness]]

	- Be aware how [[luck]] can influence our [[resulting]] if a decision outcome has 10% luck involved in leading to bad results then we shouldn't assume our decision process was bad. 
	  id:: 62660388-b22c-4085-8ed1-2227192eb12b
		- It's easier to blame bad luck for a bad outcome than it is to credit good luck for a good outcome, we would rather attribute good outcomes to their skills and talents
		  id:: 7441ba92-f9b2-4d11-9934-85e59358ac22
		- Even when you make a good decision, that doesn't mean that it was the best decision, it rarely is. How can we created [[feedback loop]]s to ensure we are striving for the best decision process
			- We can learn from decisions with good outcomes. Don't assume you can't find worthwhile lessons while taking a victory lap
			  id:: 62660388-70b7-45fd-a2a3-29676fd6ae3f
	- [[resulting]] makes us lack [[compassion]] for ourselves and others. When someone has a bad outcome in their life, we judge their decision-making as poor because of resulting. It makes it easy to blame them for how things worked out.
		- For good outcomes, we're not doing anyone a service by potentially overlooking their mistake simply because it worked out.
- Making better decisions starts with [[learning]] from our [[experience]]s. Resulting interferes with that learning, causing you to repeat some low-quality  decisions and stop some high quality decisions. It also keeps you from examining quality/good-outcome decisions (as well as bad quality/bad outcome decisions), which still offer valuable lessons for future decisions.

- [[Hindsight Bias]]
	- The tendency to believe an event, after it occurs, was [[predictable]] or [[inevitable]].
	- ((5dbb51f1-1795-48e6-8fc7-693152238d47))
		- ((57c15e5e-ade7-4ebe-8a05-a9246c1220ee))
	- hindsight bias, like [[resulting]], make us lack [[compassion]] for ourselves and others. To know what was reasonable for others to know, we have to have [[empathy]] for them. We are quick to blame the decision-maker for a bad outcome, neglecting to put ourselves in their shoes at the time of the decision.
	- [[memory creep]]
		- when what you know after the fact creeps into your [[memory]] of what you knew before the fact.
			- If you misremember the past, you are going to learn useless lessons from your experience:
				- to assess the quality of a decision and learn from your [[experience]], you need to evaluate your state of mind honestly and recall what was knowable or not knowable as accurately as possible
				- [[Hindsight Bias]] makes you feel like the outcome was much more predictable than it was. This can cause you to repeat some low-quality decisions and to stop making some high-quality decisions.

- The paradox of [[experience]] - Chapter 2
	- A lot of [[experience]] can be an excellent teacher, a single experience, not so much and may interfere with our [[learning]].
	- [[counterfactuals]]
		- you can't fully [[understand]] what there is to learn from any outcome without understanding the other possibilities that could have taken place
		- exploring counterfactuals helps us to understand [[why]] things happened or didn't happen
	- create a decision tree to explore [[alternative histories]] to learn from both good and bad outcomes

	- it's not that an outcome is never informative, it is that it is informative only when the outcome is [[unexpected]], when you didn't [[anticipate]] the result in the set of possibilities.
		- your [[decision]] is only as good as your ability to anticipate or [[forecast] how they might turn out
- Six steps to better [[Decision Making]]
  id:: 95606eba-d560-4287-be02-ed612ef884a4
	- 1. Identify the reasonable set of possibilities #[[worst outcome]]
	  id:: 0a966615-175c-45fc-8f26-9c2d73abbc74
	- 2. Identify your [[preference]] using the [[payoff]] for each outcome
	  id:: 4052b886-5d6c-47a4-8042-daecacd73462
		- to what degree do you like or dislike each outcome, give your values
		  id:: 4081bdb4-12c0-4e80-9fee-40a33d213a42
	- 3. Estimate the likelihood of each outcome unfolding
	  id:: e91f5a00-0f8d-4cfb-815e-38ac4b046a14
	- 4. Assess the relative likelihood of outcomes you like and dislike for the option under consideration
	  id:: e8ec06b0-6e5d-4390-a05f-a1ca94864e40
		- add a range of lower and upper bound estimates for likelihood; and assess your own bias for overconfidence in estimation. Question your own beliefs and ask others for help to get closer to a realistic range
		  id:: 5b67ec82-a225-420c-afb0-9e858d861e8d
	- 5. Repeat steps 1-4 for other options under consideration
	  id:: 0aa00eac-c525-49eb-9a76-cb07867fe8ef
	- 6. Compare the options to one another
	  id:: e5971590-2d70-4cfe-a62c-3498abd4ef80
	- Incorporating [[preference]]s, [[payoff]]s, and probabilities into a decision tree is an integral part of a good decision process
	  id:: 9c369ee2-1b19-485d-8ba6-119a84668d8d
- A [[pros and cons]] list is a poor decision tool because it is flat. It lack information about both the size of the payoffs and the probability of any pro or con occurring. It lacks the tools to evaluate options and compare among themselves
- good decision making requires the willingness to [[guess]]
	- don't overlook the territory in between right and wrong
	- you're job as a decision maker is to figure out two things:
		- what do I already know that will make my guess more educated
		- what can I find out that will make my guess more educated
	- use [[precise]] language when talking about [[probability]]
- Our own beliefs create impediments to to our decision making. We are bad at figuring out when our beliefs are inaccurate and have too much [[confidence]] in what we think we [[know]]. We have difficulty switching [[perspective]]s to see our own problems outside of ourselves
	- Our beliefs are tied to our identities making it difficult to have objective assessments of them without feeling threatened if we are incorrect or have to make changes as they relate to how we see ourselves. We need to cultivate humbleness and willingness to be wrong. Stamp out any little signs of being overconfident unjustifiably. See and be aware of how much [[luck]] and circumstance play a role in our [[success]] and [[failure]]

			- ((6133b2df-c655-4cf2-b97b-ce5757ba9aa5))
				- Any good decision making process starts by considering the [[outside view]] and anchors there because we naturally live in the inside view.

				- ((3ccfaa75-adbe-4d32-98d9-26a06a20a03e))
			- being [[smart]] makes you more vulnerable to the overestimation of yourself from the [[inside view]]
				- ^^smart people are better at [[motivated reasoning]], the tendency to reason about information to confirm your prior beliefs and arrive at the conclusion you desire.^^
					- the combination of motivated reasoning, the propensity to mislead yourself, and an overconfidence in intuition makes smart people less likely to seek [[feedback]].
						- ^^When they do seek feedback, their ability to spin a persuasive narrative makes other people less likely to [[challenge]] them. ^^
				- [[base rate]]: [[P: What is a base rate]] [[P: Why is a base rate important]]
					- a base rate is how likely something is to happen in situations similar to the one you're considering
					- a base rate gives you a place to start when you are trying to estimate the likelihood of any outcome (or the upside and downside potential)
			- Another way to get out of the [[inside view]] is to actively seek out what other people know
				- be thankful when people [[disagree]] [[challenge]] you in good faith, because they are being kind when they do
					- ^^there is greater harm when you try to shield yourself from [[disagreement]]^^
				- ^^Use [[tools: perspective tracking]] Some questions to ask yourself to get outside the [[inside view]]^^
					- 1. Ask yourself, if a coworker or friend or family member were to have this problem, how would you view their problem? How might your perspective differ from theirs? What advice might you give them? What kind of solutions would you offer?
					- 2. Ask yourself if there are any relevant base rates or information you could find about what's true of people in your situation in general.
					- perspective tracking helps you correctly attribute [[luck]] to your successes and downplay your own skills/talents/decision skills while for bad decision the reverse

- Chapter 7 - Breaking free from [[analysis paralysis]], speeding up or slowing down the decision making process
	- time accuracy trade off in [[decision making]]: increasing accuracy costs time. Saving time costs accuracy
	- ^^employ the [[happiness test]] to set the pace of the decision making^^
		- Ask yourself if the outcome of your decision, good or bad, will likely have a significant effect on your happiness in a year. If the answer is no, the decision passes the test, which means you can speed up. Repeat for a month or a week timespan.
			- The shorter the time period for which your answer is "no, it wont much affect my happiness," the more you can trade off accuracy in favor of saving time.
- Freerolling: Deciding fast when the downside is slim to none
	- [[freeroll]] - a situation where there is an asymmetry between the upside and downside because the potential losses are insignificant
		- a useful [[mental model]] for [[opportunities]] you can decide to seize quickly because there is limited downsides for making a bad decision
			- ask yourself what is the worst that can happen or will I be worse off than I currently am?
		- people will usually pass on a freeroll because of the impact obscure that the upside is asymmetrical to the downsides. People also
		- people will usually pass on a freeroll because of the impact obscure that the upside is asymmetrical to the downsides. People also [[fear]] [[failure]] or rejection if they do decide to take on the freeroll [[opportunity]]
			- ^^when we pass on opportunities or let small fears and temporary negatives slow us down, we're magnifying the moment of rejection and ignoring the asymmetry working in our favor. ^^
- **When a decision is hard, that means its easy.**
	- The very thing that slows you down is having multiple [[options]] that are very close in quality--is actually a signal that you can go fast, because this tells you that whichever options you choose, you can't possibly be that wrong, since both options have similar upside and downside potential.
		- __Ask yourself, Whatever choice I choose, how wrong can I be?__
		- ^^Your [[return on attention]] or [[return on investment]] is minimal when your options are very close in quality^^
		- the more options that you have that look good to you the more likely you will be in [[analysis paralysis]]
		- use the only-option test to help you decide.
			- If A was my only choice would I be happy with that choice?
	- The big gains that you get from your [[decision making]] [[time]] are in the [[sorting]]: figuring it out, given your values and your goals, what makes an option "good."
- ^^[[opportunity cost]] when you pick an option, you lose the potential gains associated with the option you don't pick^^
  id:: 4d5eaf51-22cc-43c2-8cbe-48059db70ba0
	- Should be a factor in how you manage the time-accuracy trade-off.
	- [[quitting]] doesn't deserve its nearly universal negative reputation. Quitting is a powerful tool for defraying opportunity cost and gathering intel, intel that will allow you to make higher-quality decisions about the things you decide to stick to.
	- the lower [[cost]] to quit, the faster you can go, because it's easier to unwind he decision and choose a different option, including options you may have rejected in the past
	- ^^[[decision]]s where the [[cost]] to [[quit]] is manageable also give you an [[opportunity]] to gather [[information]] through [[innovation]] and  [[experimentation]]^^
		- **try stuff you can quit. Figure out what you like and what you don't like. Figure out what works and what doesn't work.**
- ^^[[decision stacking]] finding ways to make low-impact easy to quit decisions in advance of a high-impact, harder to quit decision^^
- you can choose to pick all options in parallel if not cost prohibitive. However your [[quality]] of execution of those options will suffer as well as increased costs, though your [[risk]] exposure is lessened.

- Knowing when you're finished
	- If your goal is to get to [[certainty]] about your choice,  you'll never be finished. Chasing certainty causes [[analysis paralysis]].
	- Part of a good decision making process is asking yourself: "Is there information that I could find out that would change my mind?"
		- **If the answer is no, there isn't any information that I could find out to change my mind, then you're done and finished with your decision.**
		- If the answer is yes and you can find out information, ask the follow up question of whether you can afford to get it.

- Think Positive, but Plan Negative #[[risk managing]] #[[risk analysis]]
	- [[Imagining]] how you might [[fail]] doesn't make failure materialize. There's a lot of value in picturing the obstacles that might slow you down or get you lost, preventing you from reaching your destination.
		- [[mental contrasting]] is the process of imagining the obstacles that might lie along the route to your destination
		- [[status quo bias]] is the tendency to believe that the way things are today will remain the same in the future
			- ^^when you look forward from the present, the status quo bias distorts your view^^
	- [[prospective hindsight]] is imagining yourself at some time in the future, having succeeded or failed at a goal, and looking back at how you arrived at that destination. Prospective hindsight enhances mental contrasting because looking back from your destination is a more effective way to plan the best route than looking ahead at where you are trying to go.
		- ^^it's helpful to get [[guidance]] who already traveled to where you want to go^^, (if you respect their thinking, though they might have gotten to where they are due to bad systems)
		- prospective hindsight also gives us the advantage of getting the outside view
- [[premortem]] #[[risk managing]] #[[risk analysis]]
	- Imagining yourself at some time in the future, having failed to achieve a goal, and looking back at how you arrived at that destination.
	- steps to conducting a premortem
		- (1) Identify the goal you’re trying to achieve or a specific decision you’re considering.
		- (2) Figure out a reasonable time period for achieving the goal or for the decision to play out.
		- (3) Imagine it’s the day after that period of time and you didn’t achieve the goal, or the decision worked out poorly. Looking back from that imagined point in the future, list up to five reasons why you failed due to your own decisions and actions or those of your team.
		- (4) List up to five reasons why you failed due to things __outside your control__.
		- (5) If you’re doing this as a team exercise, have each member do steps (3) and (4) independently, prior to a group discussion of reasons.
	- There are two categories of stuff that can [[interfere]] with achieving a [[goal]]:
		- **Stuff within your control**—your own decisions and actions or, as is often the case in a business setting, the decision and actions of your team
		- **Stuff outside of your control**—in addition to luck, the decisions and actions of people you have no influence over
- [[backcasting]] #[[risk managing]] #[[risk analysis]]
	- Imagining yourself at some time in the future, having succeeded achieving a goal, and looking back at how you arrived at that destination
	- Steps to backcasting
	  id:: 1e3512fb-f06a-4765-a7be-fc033b022587
		- (1) Identify the goal you’re trying to achieve or a specific decision you’re considering.
		- (2) Figure out a reasonable time period for achieving the goal or for the decision to play out.
		- (3) Imagine it’s the day after that period of time and you achieved the goal, or the decision worked out well. Looking back from that imagined point in the future, list up to five reasons why you succeeded due to your own decisions and actions or those of your team.
		- (4) List up to five reasons why you succeeded due to things __outside__ of your control.
		- (5) If you’re doing this as a team exercise, have each member do steps (3) and (4) independently, prior to a group discussion of reasons.
- Ways to prepare setbacks
	- When you consider how you might respond to negative outcomes in advance of those things happening, you're likely to think more rationally.
	- Identifying how things can go wrong helps:
		- Reduce emotional impact those outcomes will have on your decision making when they do occur
		- Learn to recognize the signs that you're on tilt so you can identify and address it more quickly
		- Precommit to certain actions that you'll take (or refrain from taking) in the wake of bad outcomes
			- For example, if you've identified that you bad decisions following sudden drops in the stock market, get someone else to execute trades for you in order to prevent making impulsive trades yourself.
	- [[hedge]] paying for something that you hope you'll never use to mitigate the impact of a downside event
		- when you identify the possibility of bad luck, there are things you can do in advance to soften the impact of that bad luck. Insurance is a classic example of a hedge.
			- 1. A hedge reduces the impact of bad luck when it occurs
			- 2. A hedge has a cost
			- 3. You hope you never use it
		- [[premortem]] lets you identify where bad luck might intervene
		- When executing a hedge, also think about how you will feel in advance if you don't use the hedge, even though you already paid the cost for the hedge #[[Hindsight Bias]]
- Chapter 9 - Decision Hygiene - If you want to know what someone thinks, stop infecting them with what you think
	- When we offer our opinion first when we solicit someone's advice is that it significantly increases the likelihood that they will express the same belief back to us.
	- The better we understand why we believe the things you do, the higher in quality those beliefs become.
	- ^^Group decision making quality is often worse than individuals. Research has shown that even when individual members of the group are in possession of information that goes against the consensus opinion, they often won't share it.^^
		- **This is especially true if group members detect a group consensus forming. **
		- ^^We should solicit individual opinions before the group meets, then present at the group meeting. People give feedback that more accurately represents their  knowledge and preferences when they do it independently and privately, compared to doing it in a group.^^
			- to minimize the [[halo effect]] feedback can be anonymized
		- ^^A good group process encourages [[feedback]] that includes giving people the space to express a lack of understanding.^^
	- The goal of good-decision making can't be that every single decision will work out well. Because of the intervention of luck and incomplete information, that's an impossible goal.
		- The decisions you make are like a portfolio of investments and your portfolio as a whole advances you toward your goals, even though any individual decision might win or lose.
		- If all we do is seek confirmation that the quality of our decisions is good an the things we believe are true, we can expect to be an effective [[learner]]
