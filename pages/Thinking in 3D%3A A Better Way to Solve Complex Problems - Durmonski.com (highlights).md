	- The scientific word for 3D thinking is [spatial visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_visualization_ability).
	  
	  Spatial visualization is the ability to rotate, maneuver, and disassemble two and three\-dimensional objects in your head. You interact with objects with your working memory to see how they look from all sides and potentially figure out how they were assembled.

	- Three\-dimensional thinking in relation to solving everyday problems can be considered your ability to observe problems from all sides. Disassemble them so you can find the core problem and then find a creative solution outside of the current domain.
	  
	  Letâ€™s consider an example so we can grasp the idea betterâ€¦
	  
	  The tenants of a large office building were complaining about the slowness of the elevator. It took several minutes to go from the ground floor to the top. Senior people were wasting time (and money).[1](https://durmonski.com/self\-improvement/thinking\-in\-3d/#easy\-footnote\-bottom\-1\-21289)
	  
	  A consulting firm was hired that provided the cost for improving the current elevator and potentially adding a new, faster elevator. However, the cost was too high. Then, a young psychologist who was working in the buildingâ€™s personnel suggested something else â€“ to put mirrors in the elevators. This way, the people waiting will look at themselves. When the mirrors were installed, the complaints magically stopped. In fact, some tenants commented that they are quite satisfied with the improvements in the speed â€“ which was actually zero.
	  
	  In this example, the problem wasnâ€™t solved with a solution on the X and Y axis â€“ if we consider X to be the speed of the current elevator and Y to be adding an extra elevator. It was solved by Z â€“ changing the perspective of the users of the elevator.
	  
	  The ride with the elevator was still slow, but it was no longer boring. The mirror gave people something to do. A chance to look at the most precious thing in the world for them â€“ themselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjmzv12j93rhrh9nvp03h753))
		- **Note**: We can use this type of approach for managing up and circumventing bad leadership or bad decisions handed down to us.
	- Two\-dimensional thinking is seeing the observable truths about objects and ideas. You see things for what they are. Three\-dimensional thinking takes things further. You see things for what they *can* be.
	  
	  For instance, wind on its own is just air in your face. It can feel good, bad, and it can even destroy your house.
	  
	  But wind, seen from a different perspective, can help you run faster, sail, and even produce energy.
	  
	  In essence, 3D thinking is not looking at things independently â€“ in a void. But actively digging. Searching for all of their characteristics and how different objects can connect to each other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjn0qd9s97qyamfy47pbfaky))
	- 3D Thinking In The Workplace
	  
	  If youâ€™re a business owner and you want to motivate your people to perform better. The usual routes will be to a) offer additional rewards in some sort of a bonus scheme; b) you threaten people that you will fire them.
	  
	  And while the two probably work in some cases. Scientists argue that tasks that require rudimentary cognitive skills are better performed when people are intrinsically motivated â€“ doing something that matters.[2](https://durmonski.com/self\-improvement/thinking\-in\-3d/#easy\-footnote\-bottom\-2\-21289) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjn0r5sksa7yhkqcdesjyyv6))
	- 3D Thinking When Consuming Content
	  
	  Since a large part of our daily lives is related to consuming content. (Hey, youâ€™re doing this right now.) Itâ€™s important to think about our incentives in relation to the content and why are we watching/reading something.
	  
	  Usually, we look at the surface of the information:
	  
	  â€¢   What is being shared?
	  â€¢   How can I use this information in my own life?
	  
	  But another way to look at info is by asking yourself the following extra questions:
	  
	  â€¢   How this content was created?
	  â€¢   What are the reasons behind the creation of the content? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjn0rkyqsn8aqc4xchqz0qka))
	- How do you start thinking in 3D:
	  
	  1.  State your challenge.
	  2.  List the common ways it can be solved.
	  3.  Look for a field unrelated to yours â€“ a distant field.
	  4.  Choose a specific keyword/component from that other field.
	  5.  Think about how you can apply this component to your own field. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjn0tq9b8rx54qv4qgm6bkwp))
