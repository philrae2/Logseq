	 - Good Afternoon Sri, Thank you for the opportunity meet with. I’m hoping that there’s utility in getting perspective from the front lines and bridging the top to bottom within OBI to break some silos. And I do want to highlight observations that may affect the decisions and initiatives that are happening at your level and aligns with the relevant problems you are solving now. 

	 - The preceding context of this conversation was business analysis and requirements but I do want to put attention upstream to OBI’s decision making tools and processes.

	 - Slide 3 
		 - If I may use this illustration as analogy of the downstream outcomes from our upstream decisions and business analysis activities from the past, I’m seeing a lot of movement in reassessing our processes on harmonizing architecture and data models. 

		 - And I’m assuming here that you’re seeing the negative outcomes of past OBI decision making on software development. 

		 - And the question I want to highlight is do you feel confident you have the tools and support from the bottom up to make informed decisions.

		 - I think there is great opportunity and return in investment in placing attention to assess our decision making and strategy type of thinking tools and processes on top of the resources placed in our business analysis/requirements activities. 

		 - I do want to take pause here and say that I have a limited perspective here and what’s happening at my level may not be a symptom at the higher executive level, but I am observing some gaps in the front lines about decision making gaps. And Sri I think you’re seeing the outcomes of the decisions OBI made before you came and you’re pointing them out now. 

	 - Slide 4
		 - Back to the question of does executive leadership have the tools to make informed decisions, the relevant claim here of “We need to improve our decision-making processes because fixing our mis-steps after the fact is too costly.” Comes from all these activities reworking, refactoring, and rethinking past decisions because of their negative outcomes.

		 - We’re stuck in the past fixing our mistakes, instead of investing in our future. I’m seeing that you’re fixing past decisions from years ago that you weren’t even part of. 

		 - Are we also at risk of making poor decisions now that we’ll have to fix a year, two or five years from now? Technically the same environment was present two, three  years ago, the only difference is you. Are we looking at the state of decision making now and what are the changes at present to ensure you have the tools and support to make informed decisions.

		 - Do you feel that this is a concern?

- Key Message:
	 - ((ba0f7814-d455-4cf3-a5ac-53294a7d5a76))

- Questions: 
	 - Do you feel OBI is taking ownership and responsibility of their decisions and the outcomes of those decisions?

	 - Do you feel like we are taking ownership of the initiatives to uncover gaps and lead the initiative to find a resolution.
		 - Do you feel like you're discovering and highlighting problems and assigning people to find solutions?
			 - Do you think this is an ideal approach?

	 - I'm asking these questions because the answers point to either a positive or places for improvements for OBI. The less tangible but impactful 

- Options
	 - Sri has to ask strategic questions to lead to a strategic answer
		 - This inference assumes that OBI is deficient in strategic thinking

	 - What are the actionable options?

	 - How do we rate the quality of these options?

	 - We're only using outcomes to judge our decisions and by then it's too late.
