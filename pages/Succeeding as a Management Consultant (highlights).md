- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[2023-04-23]]
	- A work stream or work team refers to a group of consultants within the engagement team focusing on a distinct cluster of analyses. ([Location¬†218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=218))
	- Management consultants have access to data that moves markets. We advise companies and industry leaders who make multibillion-dollar decisions on investments, new plants, hiring, firing and more. What we do matters. Yet, who watches us? We are not a regulated industry. Senior partners cannot and should not have to check every decision younger consultants make. And who checks the senior partners? Young consultants are given significant autonomy, as are partners. In the absence of detailed rules, no regulations, etc., how do consultants make the most appropriate decision? Does it even matter if you are not breaking the law or will never get caught, let alone lose your job? ([Location¬†233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=233))
	- being ethical gives you a formidable competitive advantage to accelerate your career. ([Location¬†240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=240))
	- Being ethical gives you a sustainable competitive advantage. ([Location¬†243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=243))
	- Values is a material competitive advantage that is difficult to replicate and has a tangible financial impact. ([Location¬†244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=244))
	- In Michael Porters‚Äô thinking, ethics is the ultimate competitive advantage since it requires one to adjust every aspect of their life, thinking, philosophy and activities to achieve this advantage. Doing that is very difficult which means many would not do it. This means it is hard to copy your competitive advantage. This means you are unique. It is worth understanding and building your life around this. It is one of the most formidable tools you can have to build your career and life. ([Location¬†245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=245))
	- When we are young, we tend to use the few signals we have to show our worth and standing. These typically include having Harvard and McKinsey on your resume and a GMAT score north of 760. That is why people are obsessed with accumulating them. ([Location¬†252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=252))
	- If you are someone whom people trust implicitly, they will hire you just because having you there signals enormous credibility and because they know you will do the right thing. That is one of the reasons the most elite consulting and law firms are hired. It is not just because they can do something many other consulting firms cannot do. It is because when the chairman of the board is offered a report from these firms, there is an implied credibility. It is known that these firms have a reputation for walking out of the engagement if it is wrong for the client. The fact that they completed the engagement is a credibility stamp on the report. ([Location¬†261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=261))
	- It takes years to build true credibility. ([Location¬†267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=267))
	- Other firms whom do not have such credibility look for other ways to be hired. They look for technical skills to impress the client. They may claim to have a new methodology, lower prices, etc. So, you see how this plays out. Without credibility and a strong ethical standing they have to bear a steep cost to entice clients to work with them. ([Location¬†268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=268))
	- In pursuit of his goal of becoming a millionaire he started a partnership like Graham-Newman‚Äôs sister hedge fund, Newman & Graham. This would allow him to raise money to manage and invest it from his house, putting money into the same stocks as he bought for himself. The plan was to invite friends and family into the partnership. The key for Warren was to deal only with people whom he was sure trusted him. Eventually he opened multiple partnerships and partners no longer had to be his family and friends. His name was passed along like a secret with advice to ‚Äúinvest with Warren Buffett if you want to get rich.‚Äù But one thing stayed the same ‚Äì the people who invested trusted Warren. The reputation that Warren developed by being consistently transparent and honest with his partners became his sustainable competitive advantage. This is in addition, of course, to his highly intelligent approach to investing and phenomenally hard work. ([Location¬†277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=277))
	- By 1960 Warren no longer asked people to invest, they had to bring it up. This is the same strategy as Marvin Bower used for McKinsey. If the other party asks you for your service, they don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúprove you are worthy‚Äù attitude. You are doing them a favor and not the other way around. Of course, this only works when people trust you, as they did in Warren Buffett‚Äôs case and in Marvin Bower‚Äôs case. Imagine how tough it is to work for a client who does not trust you, constantly checks your work and always wants you to prove your worth? In the worst cases distrustful clients ask for changes that may not be helpful, refuse your advice and then blame you when their approach failed. That is a pretty horrible experience. Yet, if you do not take the time to build your selfless credibility that is where you will be in life. ([Location¬†284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=284))
	- What does this mean for your career in practical terms? It means that at a certain point technical skills and career enhancing degrees/designations have declining returns. They tend to have the most returns when you are young and then quickly decline like the resale value of a car. Someone with adequate skills from an unknown school who is seen as highly trustworthy will almost always, over the long-term, be appointed over the vastly skilled person who studied at an elite school but is seen as untrustworthy. Too many young consultants focus on technical skills and career enhancing designations. Yet, credibility is more important in the long-term to get to the next level. Technical skills, and at that just good enough technical skills, are the foundation. ([Location¬†291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=291))
	- I hope not. Because by the time you are 59 years old you hopefully should have been CEO and now chairman of the board. We erroneously think if we have technical skills and impressive career enhancing designations everyone will want to hire us. That is not always true. At a certain age you have to break out into managing people and leadership. And when it comes to managing people, and leadership, the trust element becomes crucial. ([Location¬†302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=302))
	- Do people trust you to follow you? Do people trust you to put you in a leadership position? ([Location¬†306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=306))
	- This is where a reputation for being ethical, which is earned by being consistently ethical over a prolonged period of time, leads to a formidable and sustainable competitive advantage. It cannot be won overnight via grandiose action, it cannot be bought, and it cannot be faked. And the true, and only, test of ethics is whether you can cite numerous examples of when you left money on the table because it was not the right thing to do. Unless you have left money on the table without hesitation, you probably have never lived by your values or your values are inappropriate. ([Location¬†307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=307))
	- a competitive advantage is not one single thing you do, but how you organize your life to produce this advantage. That means you need to change everything. Far too many people will not understand the importance of values and ethics. And of those who understand, the majority will give up in trying to organize their lives to make this a sustainable process. ([Location¬†312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=312))
	- First, it is important to understand that ethics usually applies to three types of actions. Actions not covered by law, actions for which the law is not enforced or actions for which the law is clearly wrong. Therefore, when someone tells me, ‚ÄúKris, I made this recording because it is legal in my country‚Äù, what we hear is that the individual is very unethical. This is because even though the person would not like to be recorded without permission and knows it is wrong, they have gone ahead and done it because it is legal to do so. They are using a legal shield to do what is wrong. Ethics generally covers actions which are not covered by law. However, for this act where the law does exist but is not appropriate and we rely on our ethical judgment, the person has demonstrated poor ethical judgement. This does not make the person evil or bad. Wonderful people sometimes do unethical things. And it is very important not to shame someone for making mistakes nor punish them in perpetuity. Just talk to them and teach them. That is often all that is needed. ([Location¬†325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=325))
	- Many times, when we judge people for ethical breaches, we assume context homogeneity. We think that a person who was raised by a loving family in the United States and went to a great school should have the same punishment as someone who was an orphan in rural northern China and hardly had exposure to anything good his entire life. You cannot measure people this way because their actions are shaped by their social network and their environment. We must compensate for this context. ([Location¬†347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=347))
	- Many times, when people do things that are ethical, they are not doing it because it is ethical, they are doing it because they are trying to avoid being labeled as being evil or unethical. The flip-side of this is that a lot of actions that we see as being unethical, we see without context. And of course, a lot of seemingly kind decisions are not intended to be kind. They are done to manage one‚Äôs image in the present even if the future consequences are dire. ([Location¬†362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=362))
	- Do things ethically, provided it does not put you in a situation where you will cause harm to yourself or anyone else. When I say harm, I mean what the average person will consider being sufficiently harmful to justify sacrificing your values, such as putting yourself or your family in physical danger, etc. ([Location¬†389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=389))
	- Myth #1: If you are ethical, you are by default a nice person and usually a pushover. Being ethical does not mean you are a pushover. People can be tough and demanding, and yet still be values driven in every possible way. Being ethical does not mean you have to be nice to people. Personality and your value system are completely different concepts. ([Location¬†459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=459))
	- Myth #2: Following the rule, ‚Äúthe softest pillow is a clear conscience‚Äù is a sure path to ensure high ethical standards. It only matters if your conscience is attuned to what is actually right. If it is calibrated to things that are incredibly cruel, you will have fundamental problems making judgement calls. ([Location¬†462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=462))
	- The social construct to which you belong determines what you consider to be a clear conscience. You are your friends. When you are deciding whether you are ethical, or not, look no further than your friends and all those questionable things they do that you find acceptable. By condoning their behavior, you are desensitizing yourself to those elements you know to be wrong. You should think twice about whether those are things you should be a part of. ([Location¬†465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=465))
	- The social network you choose to join, and it is absolutely a choice, shapes your values, or lack thereof. ([Location¬†469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=469))
	- Somehow, many assume that a personal reason is a license to be unethical. It never was and never will be. Let‚Äôs hope you chose your significant other well. ([Location¬†479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=479))
	- there are two situations where we need to apply ethics to actions governed by law, when the laws are wrong and when the laws are not enforced. To summarize, ethics is required when the law is not written, not enforced or wrong. ([Location¬†492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=492))
	- ETHICS IS ABOUT JUDGEMENT The question is, how good is your judgment? If ethics is about judgment, what drives our judgement? We established that ethics is about judgment. Now let‚Äôs consider 4 situations and we will show you what probably drives our judgment. ([Location¬†496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=496))
	- the reality is, to a large degree, we are defined by our circumstances. It is easy to apply a higher ethical standard in hindsight. We can prove this. In the first two examples I have presented scenarios that today, in hindsight, we know to be wrong. In the next two examples I will give you things that we don‚Äôt necessarily know to be wrong today. Think about eating animals. Human beings consume millions of tons, maybe tens of millions of tons, of animal carcasses every year. It is completely acceptable to do this. It is acceptable to make jokes about it. In a hundred ([Location¬†506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=506))
	- two people with seemingly similar profiles will arrive at a different interpretation. This is because their judgement differs. Judgement is the way one interprets information. And to interpret information we typically rely on our past experience, readings and teachings, what we see in the media, and travel experiences. ([Location¬†547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=547))
	- all experience matters when it comes to judgement. The mistake we make often is to ignore everything we have ever done in the past, and only think about things we read about in the WSJ, HBR, etc. To have good judgement, one must be willing to marshal everything they know and apply it. If you want to build out your judgement, you need to think about the source of your knowledge: Past experiences (packing trucks, waitressing, being mugged, etc.) Readings (high school, university, media, books, comics, etc.) Education (high school, university, ongoing development, etc.) Social network (your significant other, friends, family, and their conversations) Media exposure (cable, internet, streaming, etc.) Travel (the trips you take daily and on vacations) ([Location¬†555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=555))
	- And do not be embarrassed about watching hours of Bollywood, K-POP, Turkish soaps, telenovelas, cooking shows, etc. You never know how that knowledge could be useful. We watch an incredible amount of television. And it helps with our reasoning. For example, you could very well one day be advising a large U.S. hospitality business and need to help them optimize their sourcing. Knowing types of food used by different nationalities could be useful to develop early hypotheses. If you take any case and break it down to its component issues, it stops being a profit, revenue, market entry, operations case, etc. It becomes a case about how to convince families in Chicago to buy insurance, which ingredients should be used to make medicine more ‚Äútasty‚Äù to children, how to stack more boxes in a semi that is travelling from Mexico to the USA. As you can see, very mundane sources of knowledge can help here. The point is you need to use what you already know. ([Location¬†569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=569))
	- Judgement is essential, and it comes from everywhere. Your job is not to assume you must ignore what you already know. You must learn to use it. ([Location¬†579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=579))
	- The big issue with solving problems only with first principles and leaving out judgement is that anyone can learn how to solve a problem from first principles. You are valuable because of the unique judgement you have. If you have no unique judgement, we could essentially hire anyone who knew how to solve a problem from first principles or simply automate the task. Analysis will only get you so far; how you interpret the findings is judgement and having the confidence to put forward a controversial interpretation based on your judgement is equally important. That brings us to the difference between responsibility and accountability. ([Location¬†585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=585))
	- The responsible person does what they are told, correctly. The accountable person thinks about why they are completing task x, determines if another task should be done to achieve the intended goal and makes those changes. They own the problem and not the solution. People who own the problem work harder, face tougher hurdles and are sometimes seen as arrogant, but they get the job done and ultimately are more successful. ([Location¬†590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=590))
	- WEEK 0 WEEK BEFORE THE ENGAGEMENT ([Location¬†666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=666))
	- Week 0 is also known as the pre-engagement week. It is rare to have them. The team will work in the office and away from the client. The objective of this week is to ensure the team fully understands as much about the client and the problem as they possibly can and before they arrive on-site. At the end of the week, the team must actually develop their solution and thereafter use the engagement to test their hypotheses. ([Location¬†670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=670))
	- They will also read competitor information and obtain advice from other consultants who have worked on similar engagements. The objective is to gain a broad understanding of the issues without going into too much detail. ([Location¬†679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=679))
	- ISSUES As the team conducts its research, each member will write down any issues they think affect the client. The team is not worried about the accuracy of the lists of issues at this point. The aim is to generate a list of issues based on educated guesses and a careful reading of the material available. The team will try to go broad and identify as many issues across as many areas of the business as possible. ([Location¬†681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=681))
	- THEMES Posting issues on a whiteboard helps everyone see a common set of items, potential patterns, and themes developing. In the second or third meeting, the team starts discussing the common themes from the list of issues. The session focuses on clustering the issues into common themes. ([Location¬†689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=689))
	- KEY QUESTIONS The group uses this discussion on themes and key issues to spur debate and gain a better understanding of the engagement. This robust debate forces consultants to ask important, probing, and tough questions. It is as much planning for the study as an educational session for the consultants. It serves as a filter to weed out poorly formed ideas or weak thinking. After they are comfortable with the themes, the team puts aside the themes and key issues for a moment. ([Location¬†705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=705))
	- The group then takes the key question presented by the client and tests if this is indeed the key question they need to answer in the engagement. Sometimes clients raise the wrong question, which the client thinks must be answered. The engagement team tests if this is the right question. ([Location¬†709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=709))
	- Many consultants get too focused on answering the question posed by the client, but perfectly answering the wrong question will not help the client. The right answer to the wrong question will still not solve the root-cause problem. Therefore, the team takes time to ensure they are asking the correct questions in the engagement. ([Location¬†711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=711))
	- They ask themselves, ‚ÄúIf we solved this question posed by the client, would the problems at the client be resolved?‚Äù ([Location¬†714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=714))
	- Key question: How can Goldy improve its production value? Assuming they have the correct question, they need to think about how they would go about answering this question. Answering this one question is a difficult task. To make it easier and manageable, the team takes this question and splits it into smaller questions in a logical format. ([Location¬†717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=717))
	- First, are these the complete list of questions in this layer that can impact the previous question? ([Location¬†724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=724))
	- Second, have the questions been sufficiently separated so that changing the variables that impact one question will have NO impact on another question? ([Location¬†727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=727))
	- If each of the questions does not overlap through their variables, the team will say that the questions are mutually exclusive. ([Location¬†729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=729))
	- The principles of being mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) are fundamental concepts in management consulting. They are the foundations on which consulting analyses are built. The first concept ensures that no stone is left unturned in analysing the key question of the engagement. For example, imagine there was another way to increase Goldy‚Äôs production value, but the team overlooked this option. When the final recommendations are presented, it is possible that the overlooked option may have altered the recommendation. Having a collectively exhaustive set of options ensures that all avenues are explored. ([Location¬†730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=730))
	- When issues overlap and cannot be isolated, it is difficult to know why changes are occurring. It is also difficult to understand the issue. Isolating a question, issue, or analysis allows the engagement team to conduct a test whereby they can be sure that x, y, or z is responsible for the changes. ([Location¬†735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=735))
	- If the hypotheses/questions fail the test of being mutually exclusive, the analyses and findings will be flawed because they are running analyses on hypotheses that have not been isolated for testing. The team takes the time needed to ensure the analyses fulfil these two requirements, but this is not easy to do. It can take an engagement team up to a week to ensure these two conditions are met for each part of the analyses. The team applies these checks and balances as they continue breaking down the key question. ([Location¬†737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=737))
	- A level 2 question can be broken down even further. ([Location¬†741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=741))
	- Again, the team will check to determine if they are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. The team will continue building a level 4 and level 5 set of questions for each question. In the planning phase, some teams build out to a level 8 set of questions. Rarely will greater detail be needed at this stage. ([Location¬†752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=752))
	- When questions are laid out from left to right, with the primary question on the left (How can Goldy increase its production value?) and the subsequent levels fanning out to the right, it tends to look like a tree with branches. This is the origination of the term value tree or decision tree. ([Location¬†754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=754))
	- The team now goes back to the list of issues and themes it developed. Can they find a place on the tree where every issue and theme can be tested? If not, is the tree missing some questions? Are some of the issues irrelevant? Must the questions change? To accomplish this task, the team takes each issue and numbers it. A stack of post-it notes is used with each post-it note numbered to correspond to an issue. The post-it note is then placed on the decision tree where the team thinks the issue resides. Using this process, the team can visually see where most of the issues may lie. This can also serve as a check. ([Location¬†758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=758))
	- For the branches of the decision tree with the most issues, the team can conceivably assume that this is a priority area for the client. Since branches with issues will likely have different numbers of post-it notes, the branches will have different degrees of priorities. Therefore, the branches with post-it notes can be ranked in order of priority. ([Location¬†767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=767))
	- Developing the decision tree is one of the most important steps of an engagement. Using the decision tree, the team can break down a hypothesis into manageable components for analyses. The team will revisit this in the next few days and test it further until it is finalised as a strawman.[3] Engagements are not static, and as information changes, the priorities of answering the questions may change, which may cause the tree to change slightly. ([Location¬†772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=772))
	- Using these detailed decision trees and hypotheses, the engagement team can determine the likely answer to the questions before they arrive at the client site,[4] i.e., the team looks at each question in the decision tree and based on their careful preparation, they estimate the likely answer by assuming the outcome of the analyses to test the hypotheses. Using the decision tree, the team also develops the storyboard for the engagement. The storyboard is the message delivered to the client based on the expected results. This is the counterintuitive part. ([Location¬†779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=779))
	- If this is done so early, then what‚Äôs done during the engagement? The engagement is therefore the process of proving or disproving hypotheses. The decision tree and hypotheses are written as questions. Over the course of the engagement, the team will develop analyses to test each hypothesis and thereafter collect the data for the analyses. Depending on the results of the tests, the analyses are either proved or disproved, and the storyboard is altered. ([Location¬†783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=783))
	- The process can be summarised as follows: Determine the key engagement question Develop the decision tree to the 4th or 5th level horizontally Check for MECE Prioritize the branches Develop hypotheses for the prioritized branches (explained later) Develop analyses to test each hypothesis (explained later) Develop the storyboard (explained later) Collect data for the analyses (explained later) Complete the analyses (explained later) Refine the storyboard (explained later) ([Location¬†787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=787))
	- Building the overall work plan so early in the engagement requires the business case team to understand the overall problem, outline how they will design the solution, list their data requirements, and understand all the questions that need to be answered. ([Location¬†838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=838))
	- While they need to design the overall work plan soon, they also need to have a process that is flexible enough to incorporate likely changes in findings from the rest of the team. For example, what if the operations teams find a new benefit that was not identified earlier? The business case team‚Äôs approach must allow for these uncertainties to be managed without disrupting the milestones and timelines. ([Location¬†842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=842))
	- The business case team must provide direction to the rest of the team but also requires inputs from everyone else to complete its work. The team must design its approach over the next eight weeks to account for this: providing direction while also collecting information. The business case team cannot work in isolation. They need to present meaningful updates of sufficient depth, and at regular intervals, to provide direction to the rest of the team. These updates are critical input for the rest of the team and must be carefully planned. Remember that the business case team must conduct the initial top-down financial assessment of the operations. The result of this analysis, coupled with the focus interview feedback and benchmarks from Goldy peers, provides enormous insight to the engagement team. They direct the teams to possible areas of improvement or point out areas likely to generate little opportunity for improvement. Furthermore, the business case team uses these updates to test their thinking with the client and engagement team. The business case team needs to find allies in the client‚Äôs finance department who can share data, work with the team to test hypotheses, answer questions, and validate their approach. This can only be done if the business case team can clearly explain their approach and rationale and instil confidence among the finance department employees. They need to build these relationships at several levels of the finance department‚Äîat the mid-level, where they will work with the finance team on a day-to-day basis, and at the CFO level, where they need to build rapport and trust to ensure he accepts the recommendations and defends the findings. Building these relationships is difficult to do if the team is unable to explain their objectives and approach. ([Location¬†845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=845))
	- In the first meeting with any client, the consultants are trying to develop rapport and a working relationship. This is very difficult to do in a group meeting where the agenda and discussions are much more difficult to control. Furthermore, this early in the engagement the team will have little to present. They could end up looking unprepared. The reaction of the entire finance department is another unknown. The risk of damage to the consultants‚Äô reputation and hence, a setback to the engagement, is too great. Workshops must always be staged and managed events with defined outcomes. ([Location¬†865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=865))
	- For the first meeting with Flavio, Max has only one objective: to start gaining the client‚Äôs trust. As the business case leader, he cannot be arrogant, he cannot take in a lot of documents with little context, he cannot have any extra people in the meeting, and he cannot create any risks by presenting information that may be erroneous. He first needs to understand the CFO and lay the groundwork for an effective relationship. Max prepares one agenda document: Agenda Expectations of the engagement. How would we define success for the business case work stream? How should we share information and obtain approvals? Decisions needed: Focus interviews with mid-level and senior employees. Allocating finance staff to assist the work stream. ([Location¬†874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=874))
	- The agenda is prepared with great care. The objective is to draw out the CFO‚Äôs concerns so that he feels he has been heard. If he feels his concerns are heard, he is more likely to work with the business case team. Although four agenda items are raised, depending on the client‚Äôs mood, the last item will have to be covered very carefully or postponed to another meeting. ([Location¬†882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=882))
	- The agenda is written out clearly so that the CFO knows exactly what will be discussed in each agenda point. It is important to give a client time to prepare. Client relationships can be damaged if the client feels he was caught unprepared. As a professional courtesy, the agenda is sent to the PA within one hour of the request for the meeting. ([Location¬†885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=885))
	- Max also mentions that the CFO probably knows all about the engagement, and the session was booked to elaborate on the approach used for the study. Implying that the CFO does not know anything about the engagement, whether true or not, is generally never a good idea. Just in case the executive has not been informed, it is always wiser to imply otherwise but still provide a brief update. Doing this prevents an embarrassing exposure about the executive‚Äôs lack of knowledge. It‚Äôs a skill consultants use to gain the support of executives who may have been sidelined by their superiors. Embarrassed executives can become uncooperative or defensive. Neither outcome will help the engagement team. ([Location¬†892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=892))
	- The meeting seems to have gone well. Max has spent 90 percent of the time simply listening to the CFO and ensuring that his concerns are understood. Despite the hesitancy of the client, key decisions were made, and the engagement is moving forward. Max understands he must now respond to these comments in a professional way to continue building trust and respect. Hearing the CFO‚Äôs expectations and ignoring them can create more hostility later in the engagement. If the CFO feels his concerns were ignored, he is much less likely to provide his feedback in the future. ([Location¬†928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=928))
	- He knows it is a consulting rule never to go into a situation where the client has not been carefully prepared, and the outcome cannot be managed. ([Location¬†933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=933))
	- He worries that Alana will fall into the same trap he did as a younger consultant: having to discard extensive analyses after realizing too late that the hypothesis being analysed was inappropriate. This ([Location¬†939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=939))
	- She explained how it was possible for many consultants to have done the analyses on an engagement correctly only to add no value to the client since the analyses did not help solve the clients‚Äô actual problems. ([Location¬†979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=979))
	- In any study, especially longer and more complex engagements, the team needed concrete validation that their early hypotheses and focus were correct. So how would they obtain this validation? There are essentially four steps that are common to all well-planned engagements. ([Location¬†993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=993))
	- The essence of this approach is that within roughly a week or two at most, the team will have some certainty that the direction of their analysis is correct. Even if at this point they are far from done, and the focus may shift a little, Deepika pointed out that in her experience she found the top-down analyses to be largely accurate. Once the top-down analysis is done, the team is fairly certain they are pursuing the right issues and can focus on more detailed work. And if the top-down analyses indicated different issues to analyse, there is sufficient time to change direction. She stressed that hypotheses were core to the approach, but a faster check was needed. She also pointed out some limitations of hypotheses. ([Location¬†997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=997))
	- First, the business judgement of the consultant needs to be strong to interpret the initial brief, think about the initial client symptoms, and develop a realistic hypothesis. Not all consultants had this judgement. ([Location¬†1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1002))
	- Second, the engagement managers and principals need to allocate sufficient time to review the teams‚Äô hypotheses. In her experience, this rarely happens since the senior engagement team members tend to be too busy. ([Location¬†1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1006))
	- Third, fairly detailed analyses need to be completed before any validation is done. This costs time and money. There are not always simple top-down analyses to test a hypothesis. Consultants were not being taught the philosophy and tools of top-down analyses. Fourth, team members with limited sector/functional experience and judgement are forced to work largely in isolation during this period. This further weakens the quality of the hypotheses and subsequent study results. ([Location¬†1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1009))
	- Some hypotheses can be rudimentarily tested with the focus interview feedback. The design of the questions also explicitly forces the team to go broader than their hypotheses to determine if other issues exist. ([Location¬†1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1028))
	- This step is a forced process to ensure that issues are not being overlooked. Without this step, teams tend to focus on perfecting hypotheses versus checking if they are worth analysing in the first place. It is human nature for consultants to pick hypotheses that come to them easily and where the data is easy to collect. ([Location¬†1029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1029))
	- Focus interviews rarely identify the wrong themes to be analysed. Although employees may not clearly articulate the implications of the problem they have seen, when issues are clustered, the theme at the heart of a cluster is fairly accurate. Employees are at the frontline and the frontline is rarely blindsided by market events. Think about this simple example. In the fast-moving retail clothing market, a single clothing boutique store will know by 10 p.m. that night if sales of a highly anticipated new clothing line is not meeting expectations. With better digital tracking, they may even know in real time. The staff in that store will know immediately. That insight, which is crucial, takes its time to wind its way up to the management team. Once it arrives to the management team, they need to think about the impact, interpret the findings, and set a course of action. This needs to wind its way down to the merchandisers, then designers, then suppliers, and finally the store. It takes time. Yet, the insight is that frontline employees have an unfiltered and uncluttered view of what is happening. They are the organic/non-GMO version of data. Speaking to them offers data in a format that is pure. Access to the frontline staff offers the engagement team a quick list of areas to explore. In many cases, employees can also identify data sources, discuss past efforts to address the problem, and offer assistance. This last part is key since the focus interviews can identify employees who will help the team in the future. ([Location¬†1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1048))
	- Done correctly, the average top-down financial analyses across all clients, in all sectors, and irrespective of the client size, can be done in between 24 and 72 hours. The majority can be done in less than 48 hours. Many consultants and many competitor firms take far too long. They take so long since they do not understand the purpose of a top-down financial analysis. Like the focus interviews, the financial analyses are like a compass. They highlight anomalies, data spikes/dips, patterns, and trends that must be examined further. They set the direction for more work. Deepika offered four guidelines for top-down financial analyses that seemed counterintuitive, until she explained them. It is not offering a solution. It is not offering a reason for the problem. It is not forecasting nor modelling anything. Financial analyses are not financial modelling. ([Location¬†1066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1066))
	- What is the point of conducting a top-down financial analysis if it is not offering a solution, not determining the root-cause problem, and not a modelling exercise? ([Location¬†1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1074))
	- The aim of the top-down analysis is to find areas where a problem could exist, determine the likely benefit of fixing the problem, and a very rough validation with employees. ([Location¬†1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1077))
	- Again, it is hard to dispute the findings because the analyses are not interpreting much. It is simply examining numbers from the clients‚Äô own accounts and presenting them in a new way. ([Location¬†1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1085))
	- This is a powerful tool which gives the clients a view they have likely never seen before. It only works if there is consistency in capturing this information. This is actually hard to do and impacts everything about the firm in a number of ways. The calculations must be uniform and consistent. That is, a consultant working in Munich must be calculating ROCE the same way as a consultant in Mumbai. If they use different methods with different assumptions, then comparing the ROCE between both firms is meaningless. This means having a methodology documented somewhere and teaching consultants to access this methodology/data versus pulling information from an unknown source using an unknown method. This requires trust and sharing. ([Location¬†1121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1121))
		- **Note**: regarding benchmarks
	- Offices must trust other offices and have a central location to collect client data, archive the original data, and only share the sanitized version. If this trust does not exist, the database can never be built. ([Location¬†1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1127))
	- Case studies help the consultants understand how a problem evolved at another company. ([Location¬†1139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1139))
	- They help the clients visualize what did and could happen to them. They are both a visioning and planning tool. They are not a template of best practices to be copied since no two companies are the same and there is a high probability the case study may have been incorrectly interpreted. ([Location¬†1139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1139))
	- Case studies are rife with abuse. Any case study can be designed to show anything the consultant wants to show. ([Location¬†1148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1148))
	- Consultants cherry-pick both the case study to present but also the facts within that case study. ([Location¬†1152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1152))
	- Given that it takes an experienced engagement team eight weeks, at a minimum, to understand just one narrow issue at a client where they have full access to the client and data, how can it be possible for a consultant using second- and third-hand information, at best, to know what actually happened at another company to which they have limited to zero access? They cannot. Therefore, a case study should have a very narrow scope, or it is meaningless. ([Location¬†1160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1160))
	- Consultants avoid period case studies since they are harder to do. Doing a case study on Cisco for the 2001 to 2003 period is very challenging, even if it is more relevant, since the client will likely have strong views on what happened. So, consultants tend to pursue new case studies where there is more consensus on the main finding, even if that consensus is inaccurate. A case study about a current event contains data that has not yet had time to be challenged so it is easy to present it as a fact. An example of this is the numerous articles lauding GE as the greatest American company of all time. Around 2000, this was the general sentiment. A case study of GE‚Äôs success, completed in 2000 and using facts from 2000, would receive little pushback. A period case study of GE outlining an event from 2000, and performed today, would face far greater scrutiny because the market has had time to reassess its view of GE. Even if the case study of the event about GE in 2000 was actually correct, the negative halo effect of GE‚Äôs performance today would cloud the discussion the same way the positive halo effect of GE‚Äôs performance way back in 2000 clouded discussions at that time. ([Location¬†1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1166))
	- Unless the consultant was involved in the company being case-studied, and at a fairly senior level of the discussions with that client, anything they say may lack credibility. For example, how would they know x was the reason that y happened? It is therefore always important to have a partner/consultant in the room who had been involved in the company being case-studied. ([Location¬†1174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1174))
	- Case studies generate the least controversy when they lack controversy. Many consultants therefore select case studies that tell the client what they want to hear and avoid controversy. For example, using Google as a case study on innovation will usually work since the company is now seen as innovative. It may not be, but that is irrelevant since that is Google‚Äôs accepted image in the marketplace. Clients will rarely challenge the case study despite the consultant not really knowing if Google is innovative and, more importantly, why they are so innovative. Taking lessons from a Google case study and directly applying it to a client will gain easy acceptance but may not be the best thing for the client. ([Location¬†1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1177))
	- The charter is essentially the business case team‚Äôs contract with the engagement manager. It exists for several reasons: It helps to set expectations from both sides. The engagement manager uses the charter to understand the work the team will do, and the team can tell the manager what they intend to do. The charter ensures that no one can claim ignorance about the way forward. Both sides can then proceed, having a good idea of what to expect. The manager uses the charter to manage client expectations and the rest of the engagement team. The charter becomes an important tool to manage the performance and performance review of consultants both during and after the engagement. If expectations are written down, it is much easier to measure performance. From a legal perspective, if the client agrees to the charter, it is much more difficult to claim the work was not done or they misunderstood what they would receive. ([Location¬†1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1240))
	- The charter is not just there to protect Max and Alana from the client. It is also there to protect them from the pressure cooker environment of a typical engagement. With really aggressive timelines, an unpredictable client, daily challenges, and data problems, it is easy for the team to lose focus on their priorities. The charter can serve as a necessary reminder of the objectives, ensure they understand why they are on the engagement, and what they need to accomplish. It is very common for consultants to use the charter as their primary reference document throughout the engagement. While everything else may change, the charter should never change unless the scope of the engagement officially changes. The charter should be only one page. ([Location¬†1248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1248))
	- The consultant needs to write clearly and focus on outcomes. The charter must be written so that the rest of the engagement team can clearly understand the purpose and boundaries of the work. If the charter is more than a page in length, it is a fair indication that the consultant is struggling to understand what is needed on the engagement. Most charters are done on a PowerPoint slide so that they may be presented. For the moment, Max simply writes out his charter in a Word document and will convert it to PowerPoint when it is finalized. The charter has five components: ([Location¬†1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1255))
	- OBJECTIVES The objectives are the reasons why the business case team exists in the engagement. In this engagement, the team has three objectives: Determine the benefits for the shortlisted options to improve production value. Guide the recommendation of an option. Explain the trade-offs of the preferred option. ([Location¬†1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1260))
	- 2. SCOPE Determining the scope is important. It creates the boundaries for the business case team. Many engagements become difficult to manage because the scope is not clear. If it isn‚Äôt, the engagement continues to increase in size since the client can request more work to be done or the consultant may keep adding superfluous analyses. Unclear boundaries make it difficult for the engagement team to know when a request for work falls outside the agreed-upon boundaries. The scope could be described along such dimensions as geography, level of detail, value chain, or parts of the company analysed. The scope should also outline the depth of analysis required. Max has set the following boundaries for the engagement: Only examine options related to the core gold mining and processing business. Options for value creation that can lead to more than a 10 percent increase in value will be analysed in detail. Only one mining hub will be analysed in this‚Ä¶ ([Location¬†1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1263))
	- 3. KEY ACTIVITIES Many activities will be required to complete the work. This section lists the main clusters of activities that are critical to reaching the objectives above. This is the critical path for this team. These are the activities that must be done to generate the deliverables. No matter what happens, the team must complete these activities. Expectations exchange with the CFO to agree on the approach and deliverables. Develop framework (architecture) for the business case model and obtain buy-in.[5] Identify key information requirements to build the model. Understand the existing financial baseline performance of the business and performance drivers and levers. Complete benchmarking. Source/facilitate the finding of information. Guide other work streams. Assist in identifying key stakeholder groups: Assist in the development of focus interviews Help to conduct interviews, if required‚Ä¶ ([Location¬†1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1273))
	- 4. DELIVERABLES If the objectives of a work stream are defined as what the team wants to accomplish at the end of the engagement, the deliverables are the work and insights to be provided to the client at the end of the eight-week engagement. They tend to be more tangible in nature. Max and Alana have decided on the following deliverables: A business case for each option and the preferred option. A flexible model to simulate revenues, decrease costs, and enhance value created for each of the options. Consolidated view of whether or not Goldy can execute the preferred option and its financial health[6] in pursuing the preferred option. Overview of the drivers and levers of production value. Note the language. Consulting firms never present solutions/answers. They always present the implications of‚Ä¶ ([Location¬†1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1286))
	- 5. CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS The critical success factors (CSFs) are important. Most consultants forget to write down what they need to make this engagement successful. If Max does not explicitly state his requirements, he may not get them. Should this happen, it is difficult to blame anyone since they did not know the business case team‚Äôs requirements. Therefore, CSFs are the business case team‚Äôs requirements from the client and the broader team to ensure they can meet their expectations. Client commitment Timely access to key personnel within Goldy and access to the CFO Timely access to key‚Ä¶ ([Location¬†1295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1295))
	- Max is not naive. He knows that not everything they need to be successful will come their way. By carefully listing his requirements, however, the engagement manager, client, and his team can regularly check to ensure they are on track and receiving the support they need. Should the direction of the engagement change or scope increase, they can always revert to the charter and understand how the changes will affect their ability to deliver.‚Ä¶ ([Location¬†1303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1303))
	- A good charter is not just written to create the impression of control. It is also created to help manage the work stream. In the first week, it is usually tweaked and updated every day. The charter is shared with other consultants on the engagement for feedback but‚Ä¶ ([Location¬†1307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1307))
	- Like any good associate, Max knew that it would be foolish to take heavily marketed and hyped approaches and push them on the client. The firm believes in developing bespoke solutions specifically addressing individual client issues. While EVA and Holt analyses were popular, the team needed to start from first principles and design the approach from the bottom up. If the outcome of the bottom-up approach was the need to use EVA, they would recommend Goldy do so. ([Location¬†1377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1377))
	- ‚ÄúValue‚Äù needs to be quickly defined and agreed on with the client. At a company level, the fundamental drivers of economic value are the rate at which the company can grow its revenues and profits and its return on invested capital (ROIC) relative to cost of capital (WACC). At the mining site level, value is driven both by the tonnage produced and the economic spread (ROIC ‚Äì WACC). Yet, the operations will have no control over the cost of capital though they may indirectly influence it. ([Location¬†1403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1403))
	- It is important to keep in mind that managers are often under pressure to deliver short-term results, especially in mature companies, such as Goldy. Such short-term results are often achieved at the expense of long-term value creation. Moreover, ROCE and other accounting measures can be manipulated to pump up returns in the short term. To encourage focus on long-term value creation and make value creation a part of a company‚Äôs culture, key operating and strategic drivers should be included to measure and monitor the health and performance of the business. ([Location¬†1416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1416))
	- To recap: Production is the amount of gold or ore refined/mined and usually measured in ounces/tonnes. Production value is the dollar value of the gold output. Productivity is basically output value of refined gold / cost of all inputs to produce the refined gold. Therefore, production value can increase while productivity drops if the cost to produce more gold grows at a faster rate than the value of the gold produced. In another example, production value can drop while production increases if there is less gold in the increased amount of ore mined. A mine wants to increase all three measures. ([Location¬†1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1422))
	- They realise an early lesson learned is that they should be much more focused on the question they are trying to solve rather than the solution to that question. It is all too common for teams to go ahead and do considerable work without carefully thinking through the problem statement. The idea of dedicating a week to planning and planning reviews is again shown to be a wise way to set up engagements. Before he joined the firm, Max served as a summer intern at another consulting company that was not known for its rigorous analytical skills. That was ultimately the reason why Max left. He recalled serving on an engagement where each person on the team broke up into their mini-engagements and did their work with very little collaboration. The financial modellers built complex models that did not address some of the key challenges facing the client. Quality standards within the team were vastly different, and there was constant bickering and tension. There was little focus on trying to understand the root cause of the problems, and the key question was vague. Consultants simply went off and looked for interesting analyses. A lot of time was spent on Google, and no time was spent on hypotheses and decision trees. No one had ever heard of MECE. The company also brought in senior advisors with 30 years‚Äô experience in the sector. The advisors typically pointed out the problems, and the recommendations were built around these ideas. Most of it was opinion, and there was little substance to the recommendations. The company believed that these experienced advisors already knew the problems and solutions. This was the wrong way to do the analyses and led to incorrect recommendations. ([Location¬†1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1435))
	- What does all of this mean? Productivity is measured as the output value / input. There is no other definition of productivity. It is erroneous to assume productivity is how fast one completes a task, or the number of tasks completed in a year. Completing a task quickly that is of little value or completing many tasks that add little value will actually lower productivity. Completing just one task over an entire year that is very valuable means one is actually very productive. Understanding productivity is important. It will change your life if you manage your schedule by this definition. ([Location¬†1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1473))
	- A more productive enterprise, versus its competitors, generates incrementally more value which can be reinvested in the business to keep growing. An unproductive enterprise, relative to its peers, cannot make the necessary investments to grow, fight in the market, introduce new products, block competitors, attract talented employees, etc. A productive business can do so, and the most productive enterprise can do the most. It will have a major advantage in the market. ([Location¬†1481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1481))
	- Productivity is always a relative measure. There is no such thing as a productive or unproductive business/person. A business can only be less or more productive relative to some comparison business. So, when someone says, ‚ÄúI am very productive,‚Äù the response should always be, ‚ÄúRelative to whom?‚Äù This is because competition is always between two or more companies/people and if productivity is essential to competing, it can only be measured relative to competitors. The next question should be, ‚ÄúWhy are you comparing yourself to this person/company?‚Äù ([Location¬†1487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1487))
	- it does not matter where you start. Even if you start at the lowest possible career path, as long as you keep earning some excess value and continue wisely reinvesting this excess in your development, you will benefit significantly in the long term. It adds up like compounding interest. This is compounding productivity. It‚Äôs a term invented for this book. ([Location¬†1496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1496))
	- HOW IS PRODUCTIVITY LINKED TO COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE? A person, organization, or country must be productive to succeed in the long term. Competitive advantage is how one will go about being productive. We know that productivity is total output value divided by total input costs. Competitive advantage is knowing whether the company will mostly differentiate itself on the numerator or denominator and how it will differentiate itself to be productive. See the two exhibits below. ([Location¬†1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1515))
	- At the highest level, and in aggregate, a person, organization, or country is either trying to raise productivity by competing primarily by raising output value or lowering input costs. While they will pursue a combination of both, only one lever is the goal that cannot be compromised. ([Location¬†1534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085N58Q4V&location=1534))
	- It is possible to raise productivity significantly by hurting the company. That is a counterintuitive yet common strategy and operations mistake made in business. And this is why it is not sufficient to just raise productivity. One has to raise productivity by pursuing the right competitive strategy.

	- As you can see, the third option would be a disaster. While productivity rises steeply due to dramatically lowering the cost base, they are no longer making a luxury car and that will lead to a steep and sustainable drop in revenue over time. The COO is also competing on the cost lever versus the required value lever. Initially, sales will rise as the volume of cars produced rises in Hungary. Yet, over time, the car will lose its appeal for two reasons. First, it is no longer exclusive since more people own the car. Second, customers will notice the poorer quality and cheaper parts. That will drive down demand and prices. Over time, productivity will suffer and drop far below 2.7. As this example shows, it is not enough to increase productivity in the short term, one has to do it by focusing on the competitive advantage that is appropriate to the company‚Äôs strategy and think how actions taken now will impact productivity in the long term.

	- A central part of building business cases and economic models is the value tree. In simple terms, a value tree takes the value creation metric and breaks it down into its constituent parts. For example, if the business case team needed to build a value tree for the metric ‚Äúprofit,‚Äù the value tree for profit would have two legs: one for revenue and another for costs. Costs can be further broken down into fixed and variable costs. This process continues until the team can understand the different parts of the operation that drive profit.

	- Many documents discussing the same work stream allows for the planning to be viewed from different perspectives. This is critical. If viewed from just one perspective, for example, only the work plan document, it is possible that gaps or misunderstandings may not show up. Many different viewpoints minimize the chance of this happening. The same gaps/misunderstandings are not likely to be missed in all the documents.

	- This process creates a paper trail. It is there to protect the consultant, engagement management, partners, and client. With transparent communication and sign-off, no party can claim to have had limited information and be unaware of any activities.
