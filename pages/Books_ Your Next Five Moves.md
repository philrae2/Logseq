	- Introduction
		- > If you want to get to the top, there's always the risk that it will isolate you from other people.
		- In chess, to be a grand master, you need to be thinking 12 to 15 moves ahead. Most people don't think more than one or two moves ahead. Those people are amateurs and flame out quickly in business. Effective strategy is about making a move and being prepared to launch another series of moves based on how the market reacts.
			- You must think beyond the first couple of moves to execute an effective strategy
		- People who don't think more than one move ahead are driven by ego, emotion, and fear.
		- **Why only think of 5 moves ahead?**
			- Five moves is the sweet spot of thoughtful strategy and swift action.
			- Thinking past 5 moves can lead to paralysis analysis.
			- On a macro level, there are five moves you need to master to succeed in business.
		- Not all binary questions are actually binary. The answer to any question is actually a series of moves deployed in the proper sequence.
		- What sets shrewd strategist apart is their ability to anticipate.
			- They are willing to lose a battle in order to win the war. They may be willing to lose round one because they are positioning themselves to a better position through baiting their opponent.
		- You can't think about moving 5 steps ahead without knowing yourself.
	- Chapter 1
		- > I believe that having questions is better than having answers because it leads to more learning. Don't you have to start with what you want and figure out what you want to learn in order to get it? - Ray Dalio
		- Live the future truth, it means to live in the present as if your future truth has already become reality.
			- > IBM is what it is today for three special reasons. The first reason is that, at the very beginning, I had a very clear picture of what the company would look like when it was finally done. You might say I had a model in my mind of what it would look like when the dream—my vision—was in place.
			  
			  The second reason was that once I had that picture, I then asked myself how a company that looked like that would have to act. I then created a picture of how IBM would act when it was finally done.
			  
			  The third reason IBM has been so successful was that once I had a picture of how IBM would look when the dream was in place and how such a company would have to act, I then realized that, unless we began to act that way from the very beginning, we would never get there.
			  
			  In other words, I realized that for IBM to become a great company, it would have to act like a great company long before it ever became one.
			- People want to follow leaders who are driven by their future truth. The best believers not only believe in future truths but also inspire others to believe and execute their vision.
			- To achieve our goals and mission, we need to know ourselves and what we want and then act and behave like you achieved
	- Chapter 2
		- I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just about anything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones.
			- Your vision must align with who you want to be.
			- Your choices must align with your vision.
			- Your effort must align with the size of your vision.
			- Your behavior must align with your values and principles.
		- Motivations that drive you

			- Study Your Blind Spots by Actively Looking for Them
	- Chapter 3
		- You want to choose paths that position you for the best outcomes. That's why it's important to know your own strengths and weaknesses and find a market in which you have an inherent advantage. Choose wisely the career that aligns with your vision.
		- A richer life—financially, emotionally, intellectually—is possible only when you take responsibility for your own success. So don't climb other people's ladders. Take control.
		- Intrapreneurs don't act and think like regular employees; they act and think like owners. They're not working for a paycheck; they're working to build something that gives them pride and fulfillment. In doing so, they want recognition, autonomy, resources, and ownership.
		- Intrapreneurs and entrepreneur differ in treating authority. Intrapreneur is deferential while, entrepreneur are defiant.
		- Not making a move is also making a move. Losing time on the clock can come back to haunt you, whether you're playing chess or the game of business.
		- Companies must build their compensation structure to reward ideas and innovation. Intrapreneurs want to see that if they work, act, and innovate, their company will reward them like entrepreneurs.
		- Find a space that you can compete and have differential advantage/unique talent or skill.
			- Study the competition.
	- Chapter 4
		- The key to success for many people, at all levels of business, is "know how to process issues."
		- Processing Problems
			- Processing is the ability to make effective decisions based on access to information at hand with the highest odds in your favor
			- Processing is about subjecting every difficult choice, problem or opportunity you face to a rigorous mental analsyis.
			- Processing is playing out strategies, seeing the hidden consequences, and sequencing a series of moves to permanently solve problems.
		- The most important trait to process effectively: Taking Responsibility
			- You have to shift to seeing yourself as both the creator and the solver of issues.
			- Great processors take responsibility and asks questions like
				- How did I contribute to this
				- What did I do to co-create this situation?
				- How can I improve so I'll be better equipped to handle something like this in the future?
			- Eight traits of a great processor
				- They ask lots of questions. Having more data leads to making better assumptions.
				- They don't care about being right or being wrong. They're interested only the truth. They don't let their egos get in the way of the best idea or decision from rising to the top, even if it's from someone else.
				- They don't make excuses.
				- They like to be challenged. They enjoy learning, especially if it dispels their own wrong assumptions or if new information improves and challenges their knowledge.
				- They're curious. You can't solve problems without knowledge. **They love critical details as much as big ideas.**
				- They prevent more problems than they solve.
				- They make great negotiators. Curious problem solvers use logic to find a win for all parties involved.
				- They're more interested in permanently solving a problem than putting a Band-Aid on it.
			- Poor processors play the victim and blame others and external events rather than seeing how they contributed to the problem
			- Processing Steps to Take When Someone Ticks You Off
				- Take responsibility for  your role in what happened
				- State specifically what you did to create the problem
				- Channel your frustration into getting better and preventing future problems
			- During heightened uncertainty, too many leaders make the mistake of going quiet.
				- This is an example of making the easy choice instead of the effective choice. This magnifies the need for clear, quality, and frequent communication.
		- What extends or decreases the lifespan of a crisis:
			- Your strategies
			- Your level of poise
			- Your overexaggeration of a crisis: turning a 3 into a 9
			- Your ability to see five moves ahead
		- ITR
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FSk9ME-9wd6.jpg?alt=media&token=85dd9efa-5ca4-428e-a610-5d8b5bb57fd5)
			- You can't make a good decision without thinking several moves ahead.
				- Before making a decision start out with the rule of three by creating three different proposals for dealing with an issue, each with a different price tag, time frame and return.
				- It's easy to see only the happy path of a decision, be sure to consider all the ways it can go wrong. Don't justify your decision by running the best-case numbers or scenarios.
				- To get better you must reflect on your mistakes.
		- Expert Processors Look Forward to Confronting Issues
			- They don't fear issues. When you view crisis as an opportunity, you are winning the game.
	- Chapter 5
		- Those who have a system for making better decisions win. You need a methodology to attack any issue.
		- The ability to solve problems well is the ability to take a complex issue you're facing and break it down into a step-by-step formula that helps you identify the root of the problem.
		- <insert solve for x image>
		- Things to consider
			- What I can control
			- What Can't I control
		- Five Questions to Ask to Identify the Real Issue
			- Do I know what the real issue is, or am I looking at a symptom?
			- Does the team have the data regarding the real issue?
			- Is the issue real, or is it an assumption or someone else's opinion?
			- Is there a tangible issue or is it simply a hurt ego?
			- Am I thinking emotionally or logically?
		- Only two kinds of events require decision making
			- Offense - the opportunity to  advance your career.
			- Defense - The opportunity to solve a problem to stop moving backwards in some way
		- It's human nature to have blind spots. Laziness, fear, and greed all cause us to accept the information we're given and not dig deeper. As a result, we often miss a critical piece of the puzzle and make bad decisions—or fail to make good ones.
	- Chapter 6
		- No matter what your line of work, staying successful means working well with other people, whether they are clients, customers, employees, investors, partners, or outside vendors.
		- > When you think five moves ahead, you prevent your ego from telling you that you can do it all alone.
			- Don't assume that if you achieved a lot on your own in the past, you'll be able to achieve even more by yourself in the future.
		- Don't be selfish and look towards people for what they can give you. Rather, what you can offer them. Don't ask how others can make your life better, but how you can make everyone else's life better.
		- Insecure leaders surround themselves with "yes people". Effective leaders surrounded themselves with people who challenge them. They also find and hire people who are much smarter than they are—especially in areas in which they are weak.
		- Don't cultivate a scarcity mindset, thinking that there isn't enough, or some disaster is just around the corner where you won't have enough, to invest in retaining your brightest employees.
		- People who are given ownership of their work will treat it better than those who don't have a sense of ownership to their work.
		- When you compromise standards at the top, you create an environment in which low standards are accepted.
	- Chapter 7
		- Write down your principles and remind yourselves of them often to ensure your actions, decisions, and processes align.
			- Examples:
				- What I stand for.
				- What I don't tolerate.
				- My core values.
		- In study of who the best predictors and forecasters from experts, [[Philip Tetlock]] and his research assistants resulted that who experts were—professional background, status, and so on—didn't make a difference. What defined the good predictors were their style of thinking. Good predictors relied on an intuitive stitching together [of] diverse sources of information, no on deductions derived from grand schemes. They doubted that the cloud-like subject of politics could ever be the object of a clock-like science. They had a self-deprecating style of thinking that elevated no thought above criticism. They were always willing to be wrong and change their minds. They updated their information often. They tended to be too discursive—too inclined to qualify their claims.

		- A theory of good judgment: that self-critical thinkers are better at figuring out the contradictory dynamics of evolving situations, more circumspect about their forecasting prowess, more accurate in recalling mistakes, less prone to rationalize those mistakes, more likely to update their beliefs in a timely fashion, and as—a cumulative result of these advantages—better positioned to affix realistic probabilities in the next round.
		- Consider and align our means to meet our ends. If we are limited then so does our end.
	- Chapter 8
		- If we trust others we can gain speed by letting others run the show. However, if we have to micromanage and monitor the quality of the work of others we get slowed down.
		- Create a join agreement plan before journeying on an implementation.
		- Learn the love language of others.
			- Forget the golden rule and replace it with "Do unto others the way they want to be treated."
		- If you want to excel as a leader—show people that you take the time and care needed to understand what they want.
			- Ask yourself the following questions:
				- What makes this person tick?
				- How does this person want to be loved?
				- What makes this person feel appreciated?
				- What's the most effective way to show that I care?
				- What action will best "land" on this person?
			- Showing people that you care about them brings out their best. As a result they become more dependable and all elements of the business move faster.
		- Nine love language for business
			- 1. We need you.
				- Giving people responsibility makes people feel needed.
				- When we give people a reputation to live up to, they often do just that.
			- 2. Recognition
				- People that say "they don't need recognition" actually need it double.
				- Everyone needs recognition.
			- 3. Praise
				- There are three different types of praise
					- Private
					- Public
					- Behind their backs
			- 4. Clear direction
				- Your team needs clear direction from you.
				- Give them what you need, how to do it, and what time.
				- Typically you don't want to give people more than three things at a  time.
			- 5. Vision
				- Most people aren’t visionaries, but they need to hear you talk about vision and the future. Great leaders talk about what’s next.
				- Employees need to know that their leader is guiding them towards the future.
			- 6. Dreams
				- People want to know how their dreams are going to become reality. They need to see how doing the work today will allow them to accomplish their dreams.
