	- In the nineteen\-fifties, the American economy began to move from manual labor toward cognitive work. Drucker helped business leaders understand this transformation. In his 1959 book, ‚Äú[Landmarks of Tomorrow](https://www.amazon.com/Landmarks\-Tomorrow\-Peter\-F\-Drucker/dp/1560006226),‚Äù he coined the term ‚Äúknowledge work,‚Äù and argued that autonomy would be the central feature of the new corporate world. Drucker predicted that corporate profits would depend on mental effort, and that each individual knowledge worker, possessing skills too specialized to be broken down into ‚Äúrepetitive, simple, mechanical motions‚Äù choreographed from above, would need to decide how to ‚Äúapply his knowledge as a professional‚Äù and monitor his own productivity. ‚ÄúThe knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in detail,‚Äù Drucker wrote, in ‚Äú[The Effective Executive](https://www.amazon.com/Effective\-Executive\-Definitive\-Harperbusiness\-Essentials/dp/0060833459),‚Äù from 1967. ‚ÄúHe must direct himself.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3zgvzf81dxkx7kfff644gvm))
	- Drucker‚Äôs emphasis on the autonomy of knowledge workers made sense, as there was no obvious way to deconstruct the efforts required by newly important mid\-century jobs‚Äîlike corporate research and development or advertisement copywriting‚Äîinto assembly\-line\-style sequences of optimized steps.

	- But Drucker was also influenced by the politics of the [Cold War](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/11/14/getting\-real). He viewed creativity and innovation as key to staying ahead of the Soviets ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3zgv6pjjyxgz92yz8zdkmhy))
	- To support his emphasis on knowledge\-worker autonomy, Drucker introduced the idea of management by objectives, a process in which managers focus on setting out clear targets, but the details of how they‚Äôre accomplished are left to individuals. This idea is both extremely consequential and rarely debated. It‚Äôs why the modern office worker is inundated with quantified quarterly goals and motivating mission statements, but receives almost no guidance on how to actually organize and manage these efforts. It was thus largely owing to Drucker that, in 2004, when Merlin Mann found himself overwhelmed by his work, he took it for granted that the solution to his woes would be found in the optimization of his personal habits.

	- Productivity, we must recognize, can never be entirely personal. It must be connected to a system that we can study, analyze, and improve. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3zh71vvdeyb7vqgp5fw5wn5))
	- The benefits of top\-down interventions designed to protect both attention and autonomy could be significant. In an article published in 1999, Drucker noted that, in the course of the twentieth century, the productivity of the average manual laborer had increased by a factor of fifty‚Äîthe result, in large part, of an obsessive focus on how to conduct this work more effectively. By some estimates, knowledge workers in North America outnumber manual workers by close to four to one‚Äîand yet, as Drucker wrote, ‚ÄúWork on the productivity of the knowledge worker has barely begun.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3zh9xp0jh29beq7j6sqmre1))
	- He does still use some big ideas from G.T.D., such as deploying calendar notifications to remind him to water his plants and clean his cat‚Äôs litter box. (‚ÄúWhy would I let that take up any part of my brain?‚Äù) However, his day is now structured in such a way that he can spend most of his time focussed on the autonomous, creative, skilled work that Drucker identified as so crucial to growing our economy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3zhc55n111xkqw8m03fak59))
	- Imagine if, through some combination of new management thinking and technology, we could introduce processes that minimize the time required to talk about work or fight off random tasks flung our way by equally harried co\-workers, and instead let us organize our days around a small number of discrete objectives. A way, that is, to preserve Drucker‚Äôs essential autonomy while sidestepping the uncontrollable overload that this autonomy can accidentally trigger. This vision is appealing, but it cannot be realized by individual actions alone. It will require management intervention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3zhdbee9gqjh9sz113thhnj))

	- It seems likely that any successful effort to reform professional life must start by making it easier to figure out who is working on what, and how it‚Äôs going. Because so much of our effort in the office now unfolds in rapid exchanges of digital messages, it‚Äôs convenient to allow our in\-boxes to become an informal repository for everything we need to get done. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3zhp40ymbgze6hrbve3k7v5))
	- This strategy, however, obscures many of the worst aspects of overload culture. When I don‚Äôt know how much is currently on your plate, it‚Äôs easy for me to add one more thing. When I cannot see what my team is up to, I can allow accidental inequities to arise, in which the willing end up overloaded and the unwilling remain happily unbothered.

	- In software development, for example, it‚Äôs widely accepted that programmers are most effective when they work on one feature at a time, focussing in a distraction\-free sprint until done. It‚Äôs conceivable that other knowledge fields might enjoy similar productivity boosts from more intentional assignments of effort. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3zht2exf8m31sgr5qtkxyza))
	- What if you began each morning with a status meeting in which your team confronts its task board? A plan could then be made about which handful of things each person would tackle that day. Instead of individuals feeling besieged and resentful‚Äîabout the additional tasks that similarly overwhelmed colleagues are flinging their way‚Äîthey could execute a collaborative plan designed to benefit everyone.

	- The ability to better visualize work would also enable smarter processes. If you notice that the influx of administrative demands from other parts of your company is overwhelming you and your co\-workers, you‚Äôre now motivated to seek fixes. Such optimizations are unlikely to occur when the scope of the problem is hidden among in\-box detritus, and when productivity is still understood as a matter of personal will.
