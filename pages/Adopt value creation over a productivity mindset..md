- **Note:**
	 - Identify your mission to guide what is valuable for your career for both the short term daily tasks and long term future.

	 - We often prioritize productivity and erroneously think that our productivity is the same as creating value. While this maybe true, the value we create may not benefit our mission but the missions of others.
