	- A Task\-Oriented Approach
	  
	  A task\-oriented approach to productivity and work can be a more effective solution. Rather than focusing on the number of hours worked, instead, we prioritize the tasks over time. By making this shift, we place the focus on quality rather than the quantity of work accomplished. Meaning, we spend more effort on tasks that align with the goals and values of the company rather than getting caught up in the busywork.

	- Focus on Outcomes

Instead of focusing on the number of hours worked (or tasks completed), leaders should focus on their desired results. This requires setting clear goals for each project or task. By communicating clear metrics for success and proposed outcomes, business leaders can provide their team with a clear sense of purpose and direction.

	- To shift the focus from time management to outcome management, business leaders should communicate to their team that the focus is on achieving results, rather than simply completing tasks within a certain timeframe. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4cd8yp091vxbxeyevm5s4he))
	- Empowering team members to take ownership of their work and make decisions is another key strategy for implementing this hybrid approach. By giving team members autonomy, leaders can allow them to work more deeply on key tasks, rather than fixating about time constraints. Because they are no longer playing ‚Äúbeat the clock‚Äù their attention becomes laser focused on the most important tasks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4cd97be3sqz6vx61eqe0bn2))
	- Communicate Priorities
	  
	  Clear communication is essential for any successful team, and this is especially true when it comes to prioritizing. Leaders should communicate objectives for the quarter and provide regular updates on progress towards those goals. This helps to ensure that everyone is aligned and working towards the same outcomes.
