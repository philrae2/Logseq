	- Subject
	  collapsed:: true
	  Make sure your subject line is specific, punchy, and action\-oriented: Q2
	  Project: Action Required: Chris Goble + Mauri Skinfill ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ekvkzxge0a4621498gsr0e))
		- This is the first thing that people see, so it is your most important call to
		  action. Don‚Äôt bury the lede and subtly request Chris‚Äôs help to complete
		  your project at the end of the email. Put it in the subject line so that you
		  have Chris‚Äôs attention and he realizes there is something you need from
		  him before he even opens the email. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ekvzd3cpdfazk5k0h04j01))
		- Equally important to being specific is
		  the need to be succinct.
		  The fewer words the better, so rewrite your subject heading a few times
		  until you are satisfied that it captures the essential purpose of the
		  information you need to communicate in as few words as possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ekwac4f1c7c222c2kq6wmq))
		- The subject line of an email is a make\-or\-break moment for you. If it fails
		  to grab the recipient‚Äôs attention (as they are running between meetings),
		  it is likely to be skipped over and opened later in the day when they have
		  ‚Äúmore time to catch up.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ekwkbcsf8vprzebjx7re6j))
	- Deadlines
	  collapsed:: true
	  If there is a deadline in your email, meaning you need someone to do
	  something by a specific time, you must include it in the subject line:
	  Budget Overview: Due Tuesday, 3:36 p.m.
	  It is your responsibility to ensure that what you need to happen by what
	  time is clearly legible for the recipient at first glance. This means that it
	  needs to stand out from everything else in the email. Use bold, highlight
	  it in red, etc. . . .
	  Be sure to make the deadline as clear as possible, so use as much detail
	  as you can. The worst mistake you can make when setting a deadline is
	  using EOD (end of day). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ekx1rwsbyxza240yepf6k3))
		- One trick I like to use is setting a deadline with an offbeat time‚ÄîDue
		  4:47 p.m. Wednesday. By choosing an unusual time for the deadline, you
		  increase the likelihood of your recipient paying attention. After all, it‚Äôs way
		  more eye\-catching to see a deadline for 4:47 p.m. on Wednesday versus
		  the generic EOD. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ekx7ck26cvab9at8x144rt))
	- Bullet points
	  collapsed:: true
	  If I was ever forced to boil my entire work life into a single suggestion, it
	  would be this: use bullet points.
	  Bullet points project, ‚ÄúI am organized‚Äî
	  therefore, pay attention to what I am
	  telling you.‚Äù This is a good thing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ekxm5pr1tkw482fjf45m43))
		- When using bullet points, you should limit yourself to only one sentence
		  per bullet. If you are using more than one sentence per bullet, you are
		  either rambling or making more than one point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ekxxc53etfcdvz09t30gsp))
	- Jump to conclusions
	  collapsed:: true
	  Get right to the point in your emails. Remember that your recipient reads a
	  lot of emails every day, so don‚Äôt waste their time. The longer it takes to get
	  to the point, the greater the chance that they will miss it. Just start with the
	  conclusion or the big takeaway, and then put the rest of the information
	  after that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4eky2dxzh3t5ct03bb01war))
		- This isn‚Äôt seventh grade. Your email doesn‚Äôt need an introduction,
		  supporting evidence, and a summary paragraph at the end. Flip that sh*t around and do exactly the opposite of what your middle school teacher taught you. Start with the conclusion, and then list supporting evidence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4eky99begtypww01163ydja))
	- The attachment trap
	  collapsed:: true
		- I operate on an assumption that no one opens attachments and, therefore, I always provide a summary in the body of the email itself. Especially in today‚Äôs mobile world, opening attachments on tiny screens across separate operating platforms (Word versus Pages versus Google Docs versus Dropbox) can be such an inconvenience that your email is likely to be skipped until later in the day or ignored altogether. Therefore, it is incumbent upon you to not rely on the attachment as a stand\-alone document. Even in those cases when an attachment might be required, be sure to provide a succinct summary of key points or next steps in the body of the email, thus avoiding the most awful of email crimes‚Äî sending an email with no content (totally blank) and expecting the recipient to open the attachment and figure it out. These email rules about attachments are all about showing respect for the recipient and putting their experience above your own small inconvenience of typing out a few lines to provide context for the attachment. Just as no man is an island (John Donne), so too should no attachment be an email unto itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ekzzfr5qgkgbcsrfz85mcq))
	- ### The first step to getting promoted is setting your goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em1envsf7pkda2e4rdjn1b))
		- To speed up your process of goal setting, here are four specific rules that will help you get promoted quickly:
		  ‚Ä¢   Be specific
		  ‚Ä¢   Write one\-month goals
		  ‚Ä¢   Accomplish two big things
		  ‚Ä¢   Pick a day, any day ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em2063ceaf9ey47hsvqgwj))
		- Be specific
			- Be very specific. There is a big difference between telling your boss, ‚ÄúI will work really hard,‚Äù versus ‚ÄúI will beat projections by 25 percent, schedule and lead weekly cross\-functional meetings, and work to improve store satisfaction by 10 percent.‚Äù Writing quantifiable goals is essential to moving the judgment of your performance from emotional to factual during your year\-end review. You aren‚Äôt going to improve your financial skills‚Äîyou are going to set a one\-hour meeting every week with your financial planner to study your monthly forecast. You aren‚Äôt going to improve inter\-office relationships‚Äîyou are going to set weekly 1:1 meetings with all your key partners and solicit feedback from the team at three\-, six\-, and twelve\-month periods to measure improvement. You aren‚Äôt going to beat projections‚Äîyou are going to rate your performance down to specific percentages: A = 5 percent over projection; B = 0 to 4.9 percent over projection; C = anything under projection. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em2hd5btyw2hgkbz2dhspc))
			- If you don‚Äôt write specific goals, you put other people‚Äôs feelings and emotions in charge of your promotion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em2q2csjgwaenqxgwgmzmw))
		- Write one\-month goals
			- Goals with shorter time frames are easier to measure and therefore more useful in guiding or changing behavior. My favorite are one\-month goals. Writing your goals with an eye toward the year\-end review is a mistake, because what you will end up with are broad, generic goals that won‚Äôt be useful as guides to your day\-to\-day work and priorities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em30tvf2bem0mzyc3n36mv))
			- If you set yourself a goal to master a new skill (or eliminate a weakness) every four weeks, you will have acquired twelve new skills by the end of the year. Compare this to the alternative of a bloated, generic, year\-long blah\-blah goal, and the benefits are obvious. This process should never end throughout your entire career. Make time every month to review your past month‚Äôs goals and to set new goals for the coming month. There is always another skill for you to master, and by committing to a process of learning one new skill per month‚Äîno matter how small‚Äîyou will quickly stockpile these small arms into a powerful arsenal. Multiply this by a few years, and wow‚Äî hello, Mr. President. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em3cc5e6nm2av3gjz60yj2))
			- Three months is the optimal length of time to measure a meaningful goal. While one\-month goals may help your performance in the day\- to\-day workflow, three\-month goals will be noticeable achievements that can directly help you get promoted. I like to call them flagship accomplishments. They should include major milestone achievements or new strategy initiatives that you identified, proposed, and produced. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em3jk4dzj35rkth12wch3y))
		- Accomplish two big things
			- Simply doing your job is a good start, but it likely won‚Äôt get you promoted‚Äî at least not in the time frame that you‚Äôre hoping for. You need to undertake at least two flagship accomplishments in the next six months if you want to move from ‚Äúcould be promoted‚Äù to ‚Äúfront of the line for promotion.‚Äù This means you need to create and accomplish at least two high\-visibility projects that everyone can agree went above and beyond your day\-to\-day normal responsibilities. Examples could include leading a project across multiple teams, recommending a new business strategy for growth, or even something as simple as initiating after\-work charity hours in your department. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em3p7zxtxth1ha3pmwzqpj))
		- Pick a day, any day
			- You need to get past any discomfort in bringing up the topic of promotion, because it is completely unrealistic to think you will be promoted if you and your boss have not talked about it consistently during the past year. You need to make sure your boss knows you want to be promoted‚Äîand when‚Äîso pick a date to aim for and talk about it with your boss. Having this conversation early (at least nine months prior to your desired promotion) will ensure you both have the same perception of your current performance and potential for promotion. Of course, your boss will probably never guarantee you a promotion on a certain day, but you should at least align on a general sense of timing‚Äî twelve months, eighteen months, etc. Usually promotions are handed out at year\-end or midyear, so use these already existing milestones as a starting place, and partner with your boss to get as specific as possible‚Äîhopefully to the month level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em3rrj61r3dgh09gvse1pz))
	- There is an art and a science to talking
	  about promotions.
	  It is important that you learn how to talk about wanting a promotion
	  without making everyone hate you. The key is to frame your desire for
	  promotion as wanting a chance to have a bigger impact on the business,
	  take on more responsibility, have access to more meetings, learn new
	  skills, and have new experiences.
	  Don‚Äôt talk about your desire for a title as a motivating factor for your
	  promotion, and don‚Äôt compare yourself to weaker coworkers as a
	  justification for your own promotion. (Comparing yourself to others
	  will result in a long and unhappy life.) Don‚Äôt bring up your desire for a
	  promotion more than once a month. This can give the impression that
	  all you care about is the promotion (me, me, me)‚Äînot the success of
	  the business or the team (not a good look for someone trying to get
	  promoted). Instead, frame the discussions around your goals and what
	  you‚Äôre working on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em47ywyqppd4wj5qy69gyf))
	- The second step in building your case for promotion is to know who the
	  key decision makers are. Without understanding the landscape of the
	  organization you‚Äôre way more likely to drift into the promotion slow lane.
	  There are four key players to be aware of:
	  ‚Ä¢   Your boss
	  ‚Ä¢   Your boss‚Äôs boss
	  ‚Ä¢   Your peers
	  ‚Ä¢   HR ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em4gecsadhjbd011xtpc7j))
	- Your boss
	  Make no mistake. Without your boss‚Äôs firm endorsement and support,
	  a faster\-than\-usual promotion is not going to happen. Therefore, it is
	  incumbent upon you to stay attuned to what‚Äôs going on with your boss. Are
	  they a rising star or a sinking ship? What are their strengths? What are
	  their weaknesses?
	  Understanding what‚Äôs important to your boss and building this relationship
	  should be an important part of your daily routine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em4tr4v92jt8k5s25q7cg1))
	- It‚Äôs important to realize that most
	  promotions (97 percent) are not
	  decided by hitting a home run in one
	  specific meeting; rather, they are the
	  culmination of one thousand small
	  interactions and ‚Äúproofs‚Äù of your
	  reliability and potential to take on
	  more responsibilities within the team.
	  This is where all your hard work sending agendas in advance, being
	  organized in your weekly meetings (bullet points), and generally
	  overcommunicating with your boss will pay off. No one else will notice you
	  have been doing all these things every day for the last fifty weeks, but trust
	  me, your boss will notice‚Äîand that‚Äôs your most important audience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em555mtbf7a1xm23qgvgpf))
	- Your boss is busy.
	  One of the most annoying things they have to do is chase down five
	  different team members to gather information for a project or deadline.
	  This represents an opportunity for you to step in and offer to compile
	  everyone‚Äôs information into a single spreadsheet or email. Yes, it‚Äôs a little
	  bit of extra work on your part, but your name will start to be associated
	  with delivering the work and you will receive an outsized portion of
	  credit for the total project, thus demonstrating your awesomeness and
	  also showing your boss that you are a leader capable of bringing people
	  and projects together. Boom. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em5agpb2nmezqybgqbahaq))
	- Your boss‚Äôs boss
	  It‚Äôs not just your boss who decides if you get promoted. Your boss‚Äôs boss,
	  your boss‚Äôs boss‚Äôs boss, plus a few higher\-level people from other functions
	  and divisions who you‚Äôve probably never even heard, of are all part of the
	  decision\-making process.
	  This doesn‚Äôt mean that you need to expend a lot of energy trying to impress
	  the higher\-ups or trying to go over your boss‚Äôs head, but it helps to be
	  aware that there are larger forces at work that all have a say in deciding
	  whether you get promoted. When that time comes, you want everyone to
	  have a positive view of you, regardless of how visible you are to them on a
	  regular basis.
	  This is where your ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù comes into play. Do you have any mentors?
	  Do you consistently reach out to people beyond your immediate team? Do
	  people in the organization know your name? Being a stranger to everyone
	  but your daily coworkers hinders your ability to get promoted faster than
	  usual.
	  One easy way to start is by asking people to coffee. This is a low\-cost, high\-
	  impact solution to meeting new people and letting them get to know who
	  you are. Remember what we talked about on page 32, and focus on making
	  it easy for people to say yes. It is important that this outreach feels organic
	  and authentic, so don‚Äôt turn this into a death march of forced interactions
	  by trying to meet with every single person in just one or two weeks. People
	  aren‚Äôt stupid. They‚Äôll notice if they are just one of many, so take your time
	  and spread it out. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4em5tf5na89vv3pmj9cz3dj))
	- If you try to build your reputation on good emails and solid business
	  results you might start to blend in with the office furniture and become
	  invisible. Staking a claim to an interesting passion outside of work gives
	  people in the office a reason to engage you in casual conversation. Your
	  goal is simple: you want people to know who you are.
	  In my case, I always talk about the fact that I am a beekeeper and have
	  100,000 bees on my roof. Voil√† . . . my hero fact. It‚Äôs amazing how many
	  people will approach me in the hallway and say, ‚ÄúI heard you are a
	  beekeeper. . . .‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4emfvjb7hsth8kkj2kkxpe9))
	- There may be someone in another division who is also up for a promotion.
	  In this case, your boss has to convince not just their boss, but also their
	  peers that you deserve the promotion‚Äîsometimes at the expense of
	  someone else.
	  The point is, it‚Äôs bigger than just you and your boss. That is why it is so
	  important that you have built your network and set clear, measurable
	  goals in order to move your promotion from qualitative to quantitative. All
	  of the extra small things you‚Äôve done along the way (that other people
	  might not have noticed) will pay off at moments like this to tip the scales in
	  your favor. Advantage: you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4emgtj5cf1hdr4kft7smepe))
	- Your memory is not as good as you think it is, and there‚Äôs a good chance
	  you won‚Äôt remember everything you accomplished over the course
	  of a full year. What happened in February will be a distant memory by
	  December‚Äînot just for you, but for your boss as well. You want to make
	  sure you get full credit for your efforts throughout the year so your case
	  for promotion is as strong as possible. My easy solution for this problem
	  is to create an ‚Äúaccomplishments‚Äù folder in your email. Save everything.
	  Compliments from your boss, project kick\-off emails, business results‚Äî
	  everything counts when it comes to building the case for your promotion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4emheq42kmfd4x3ge29qrky))
