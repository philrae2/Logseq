	- **Shane:** Do we hold any self-sabotaging beliefs about leadership?
	  
	  **Marshall:** Yeah, I think we have a lot of self-limiting beliefs. And the self-limiting beliefs, a lot of these come from inside us. Basically, I can’t do this. I can’t do that. This is just the way I am. One of the most common problems is, this is just the way I am as if we have some “real” fixed identity that lives throughout time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp63fwbnscqdz1y1fjdghbs))
	- Two things happen, both bad. One, we inhibit the odds of ever getting better. Two, even if we do change our behavior we don’t seem authentic to ourselves. We feel like a phony because if the real me can’t listen and you say, “I’m a good listener. You know what I’m thinking?” Well, that’s not the real me. I’m just pretending to be a good listener because the real me is no good at that.
	  
	  So a lot of our beliefs are very self-limiting. And by the way, this is not limited to people at the bottom of the food chain. The people I coach are at the top of the food chain, and they still do this “that’s just the way I am” stuff. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp64rffsnpgmae7j679er0p))
	- if you don’t change your beliefs about yourself, it can be hard to change your behavior. Or as I said, even if you do change your behavior, you don’t feel real or authentic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp65654pssdvj5st7q8pz0s))
	- **Shane:** Talk to me a little bit about how you go through changing behavior. Do you start with the belief? Do you start with the behavior? How do you get that earned confidence to say that I can do this, even though you haven’t done it or you don’t believe that about yourself?
	  
	  **Marshall:** Well, what I do is I give everyone confidential feedback. So every leader I work with gets confidential feedback from their colleagues. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp67ffsqp6rnr406fhk7prv))
	- And then the next thing is I teach people how to respond to feedback. They go back and talk to everybody. Say for example, “Thank you so much for participating in this process.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp681qkgzjp3hn958000mff))
	- Second, “much of my feedback is positive. Ethical, dedicated, hardworking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp68rh6y65179kzxvb3s6f7))
	- or example, “I’d like to be a better listener. If I haven’t listened to you or the other people in the past, I’m sorry. Please accept my apologies. There’s no excuse.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp68vm2q618fr9tpkbw5t7p))
	- “I’m not going to ask you for more feedback about the past. I’m going to ask you for ideas for the future. If you have ideas to help me be a positive and open-minded listener in the future, what might they be?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp693w5byd481sjpvv6zc7w))
	- And then the next thing is they focus on changing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp69rcs1wzf2trh19pgj28p))
	- the key to making everything work, you have to follow up and stick with it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp69kfvd5yj379km8m8mv4z))
	- Leaders that don’t follow up and don’t talk to people don’t get better ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp6ac1yv9qk5xzm5za825dw))
	- They get better because of themselves and the people around them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp6ajfamcmjfxcekx2e8cx1))
	- In leadership, it doesn’t matter what we say. It only matters what they hear. If they don’t hear it doesn’t matter if we said it or not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp6cw0g66fefkwcmv62k83g))
	- **Shane:** One of the other points you made about leadership was working through others. And I think that’s really interesting because often we transition into leadership, I mean formal leadership in terms of running a team or an organization or a department. We’re going from a job where we’re a high achiever, but that achievement is often individual. So how do we transition from being an achiever to a leader?
	  
	  **Marshall:** Well, what you’ve just said is one of the biggest challenges of going into leadership, because we’re used to doing it ourselves. Now, you have to learn to quit being right all the time, quit being smart all the time, and quit thinking this is a contest about how smart you are and how right you are and realize that I’m here to make a positive difference in the world. And me being smart and me being right is probably no longer the way to do that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp6dr60f47679xyaztq465v))
	- What’s the number one problem of all the successful people you’ve coached over the years? My answer, winning too much. What does that mean? It’s important we want to win. It’s meaningful we want to win. If it’s critical, we want to win. If it’s trivial, we want to win. If it’s not worth it, we want to win anyway. Winners love winning. It’s very hard for winners not to constantly win. I’m going to give you a case study of winning too much that almost all of my clients fail. You will probably fail, and almost all the listeners will fail. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp8nqzy7kddsd3yb3s0vk44))
	- Well, it’s hard not to win all the time.
	  
	  And the other thing is, it’s very hard for technical people not to add value constantly. So what does that mean? I’m young, smart, and enthusiastic and you’re my boss. I come to you with an idea. You think it’s a great idea. Rather than just saying great idea, our tendency is to say, “Well, that’s a nice idea. Why don’t you add this to it?” Well, the quality of the idea may go up 5%. My commitment to execute this idea just went down 50%. “It’s no longer my idea boss. Now it’s your idea.” Incredibly difficult for smart, successful people not to constantly add value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp8nadkbdr9w064wqqpd1qa))
	- Before I speak, breathe, breathe and ask one question. Is it worth it? Is it worth it?” And he said, “As the CEO of this company, 50% of the time I’ve had the discipline to stop and to breathe and say, is it worth it? What did I decide? Am I right? Maybe. Is it worth it? No.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp8q5dt423rwvm8we4tkhy9))
	- **Shane:** Oh, there are two follow-ups I have to this. The first is reprogramming. The “stop adding too much value” is definitely something that I’ve had to catch myself doing when I used to lead a team of people. When you catch yourself in that moment, and you know you can make this idea better, you swallow it. You don’t say anything.

	- “As the CEO of Ford, my job isn’t that different. I don’t design the cars. I don’t build the cars. I don’t sell cars. I need to have great people. And every day I drive to work, I tell myself leadership’s not about me. It’s about them.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpa0h7wnb0tpk77jmz8pvhc))
