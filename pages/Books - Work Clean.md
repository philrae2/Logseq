	- Focus: How Mise-en-Place Works
		- “You’ll see,” he continues. **“By being organized, you will be more efficient. By being more efficient, you will have more time in your day. By having more time in your day, you will be more relaxed in your day; you will be able to accomplish the task at hand in a clear, concise, fluid motion.”** LiPuma promises them that by the time they leave his kitchen, they’ll be smooth and calm, like him.
		- Without learning how to work, and work clean—meaning to do that work with economy of time, space, motion, and thought—they can’t cook professionally
		- **Chef Keller posts a plaque beneath a clock in his kitchen that reads “Sense of Urgency.” He teaches his cooks how to tie and untie plastic bags and how to open and close refrigerator doors. He works toward a perfect method for everything.** That level of control—one that workers in another industry might resent and deride as micromanagement—is welcomed by the cooks at The French Laundry because they want to learn from Keller. The atmosphere of mutual striving delivers what they want: not only the ultimate manifestation of cuisine, their chosen vocation, but the ultimate manifestation of themselves as professionals and as people.
	- Chaos: How We Work without Mise-en-Place
		- “And everything that follows from that,” Keller replied. **For Thomas Keller, working clean isn’t just about cleanliness, or order, or minimalism. It is about practicing values. What are your standards? What habits make you successful? How strongly are you willing to hold on to your regimen of good habits in a world that will tempt you to ditch them, often without any immediate consequence? How much are you willing to keep your own focus despite the chaos around you?**
		  id:: 62cad74a-5185-4ed6-afb3-7565ebad835c
		- **Mise-en-place comprises three central values: preparation, process, and presence**. When practiced by great chefs, these three mundane words become profound. They have formed the core of the conscious chef’s work since the time of the tenzo, and they still drive the lives of contemporary chefs. The by-product of these values may indeed be wealth or productivity, but the true goal is excellence.
		- Chefs commit to a life where preparation is central, not an add-on or an afterthought. **To become a chef is to accept the fact that you will always have to think ahead, and to be a chef means that thinking and preparation are as integral to the job as cooking**. For the chef, cooking comes second. Cooking can’t happen without prep coming first
		- **Preparation and planning alone are not enough to create excellence. Chefs must also execute that prepared plan in an excellent way. So they ensure excellent execution by tenacious pursuit of the best process to do just about everything.**
		  id:: 62cad74a-906e-4987-8ed3-1d9a5c0b5c09
			- **Excellence arises from refining good process—how can I do this better, or easier, or with less waste? It’s a job, like preparation, that never ends.**
			  id:: 62cad74a-9ab9-4679-9d96-2fee19f5ef45
		- Chefs commit to being present in ways from the mundane to the sublime.
		- Finally, committing to be present means that chefs cultivate discreteness, boundaries between their work and their personal lives. To being either in or out, on or off. When we work, we put our all into it. When we play, we don’t hang on to work. Wherever we are, we’re there.
		- **What we need is to work clean with time, where working clean with time means two things.**
			- Determining our daily actions
			- Ordering those actions in sequence
		- What he knew was going to happen—he could greet chaos, embrace it. His mastery of the expected would enable him to better deal with the unexpected. You plan what you can so you can deal with what you can’t.
		- **Planning is primary for chefs in another way: It takes longer to plan and prepare than it does to cook**. As a result, the mind-set of a chef toward both his personal planning and the planning of his entire kitchen is different from yours or mine. Because planning is “first thought,” chefs invest much more time in the action of planning.
		  id:: 648b7a16-00bf-4011-a4bb-86ef1f8ee833
		- Here’s an exercise for habitual overplanners. We’re going to find your Meeze Point: the optimal number of Actions you can put on your daily list before you begin to overload yourself, an Action being either an appointment or a task. This will become your normal daily work threshold. Begun as a 1-day-per-week exercise, finding your Meeze Point can ease you out of the overplanning habit
		- **Plan complex, multistep projects as chefs do: with the end in mind**.
		  id:: 648b7a16-3b06-4509-b4de-7a1665d1971f
			- Just as some chefs begin a dish by drawing a plate, for your own projects, first envision the moment of delivery, then plan backward from it.
			  id:: 62cad74a-e16c-4257-9ce1-704f86e1ec2f
			- What resources will you need to make it look, read, feel, or sound perfect? What time will you need? Have you accounted for possible delays, holidays, disruptions? Have you given yourself time to inspect and correct? What other things will you have to give up in order to deliver?
			  id:: 62cad74a-7d3a-4eac-9e9d-d6d9f6a7e4c2
		- Indeed, chefs and cooks spend their careers rehearsing and refining their “moves,” and they regard good moves in other cooks as basketball players might revere the hook shot of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
	- Arranging Spaces, Perfecting Movements
		- Our offices may not have the physical demands of the professional kitchen, nor quite the degree of repetitive motion, nor the moment-to-moment need to save and shave time. But we all feel the psychological and physiological results of disorganization; we’ve all lost minutes, even hours, of our time looking for tools or resources, or re-creating lost work. Our keyboards and screens require all manner of repetitive, automatized movements; and we all suffer from time wasted by failing to apply our mental capacity to our daily movements, and to the execution of complex processes, which are also movements on a macro level. A project that ends up sidetracking managers and workers for days or weeks or longer is just one big, bad wasted move to be looked at with the same skeptical eye.
		- **In the office world, we not only devalue space and motion, we hardly think about them at all. Mise-en-place encourages us to look at the human, physical side of work—even virtual, digital work—and to apply those same concepts of eliminating resistance to higher orders of motion and process.**
		- **Cleaning as you go, not waiting to clean, separated true chefs and cooks from everyone else**. If Samantha cleaned her cutting board and station as she made messes or mistakes, her environment would always be optimal for success and her system would remain intact. If she waited to clean and let things accumulate, she’d lose her attention to detail in a restaurant where the details mattered. You can’t tend to the details if you can’t see them. If she waited to clean, she’d also make cleaning harder and more time-consuming with every passing minute, as the detritus of her workday began to ossify into a culinary archaeology that she would have to excavate herself. New cooks make more messes than seasoned ones, so cleaning wasn’t only doubly difficult for Sam, it was doubly important.

	- Cleaning As You Go
	  id:: 62cad74a-3ff8-4377-9dca-7e51b440407a
		- This holistic view of cleaning—that it should be integrated into every moment of a chef’s work, and that cooks clean not just for one but for all—creates the foundation for excellence in the professional kitchen.
		  id:: 62cad74a-5a56-4a3c-b120-43cb2bf42e09
	- Making First Moves
		- **The present has incalculably more value than the future. An action taken now has immeasurably more impact than a step taken later because the reactions to that action have more time to perpetuate.**
		  id:: 62cad74a-10d5-4b81-8b6e-e2593a82cf4e
			- Furthermore, because our mind state has a huge effect on how we perceive time, acting in the present releases psychological pressure and opens up more time. Starting is, in effect, a shortcut. To mash metaphors: A stitch in time causes a wrinkle in time.
			  id:: 62cad74a-212f-4969-81f3-fa492598e762
		- chefs and cooks cultivate a two-dimensional concept of time. A chef thinks this way: In the foreground are the projects that need my presence: my hands, my mind, my body. But in the background are the projects that don’t need my continued presence, but need me to start or maintain them.
		- I call “hands-on” time immersive time, because the projects that happen in it are wholly executed by me and happen largely independent of external processes and other people. The vegetables won’t chop themselves. Hands-on, immersive time aligns with creative work—activity with which we engage fully. I call “hands-off” time process time, because the tasks and projects therein are dependent on and linked to external processes. Some of those processes are impersonal: The rice needs a certain amount of time to simmer; other processes are interpersonal: Joe needs the chicken stock from me so he can prepare the sauce. Hands-off, process time aligns with management work—engaging with external objects, processes, or people.
		- When a task in the present unlocks a cascade of work that other people do on our behalf, the worth of process time increases and becomes harder to measure
		- Who hasn’t felt the sting of a forgotten e-mail—one that would have taken us a few seconds to answer when we received it but now because of our delayed reply has cost us an opportunity or created extra work
		- Even if we haven’t articulated the concept for ourselves, we’ve all experienced the dual nature of immersive and process time and its repercussions. Making first moves engages the power of time in three ways and helps us work clean with priorities.
		- **First, a first move can serve as a placeholder or a mark. When we don’t have time to execute in the moment, a mark put in the right physical or digital place ensures that we won’t forget an action and can subtly tilt us toward the task to be done.**
		  id:: 62cad74a-c6f1-4bc4-a568-b6e6085582a1
		- **Second, making first moves creates momentum**. The first move compares to a beachhead, a military term signifying the most difficult first step of an invasion by sea. In our case, making the first move creates an initial staging area for a project, a foundation necessary for further progress. If you can’t act in full now, make one small move toward completion.
		- **On the highest level, making first moves results in multiplication. Investing the present moment with action can save multiple moments in the future. Mastering the art of compounding time requires a fluency in time’s dual nature**. Making first moves, cultivating a sense of immersive and process time, means acting immediately to set processes in motion and multiply your power and productivity.
		- Process time unlocks work on your behalf; delaying process tasks will delay their benefits to you and others.
			- (Process time is taking care of tasks that are intertwined with dependencies to other tasks held by other people)
			- Remember, anything that needs your input or feedback on a project to keep it moving forward is process work.
		- Immersive time can accord larger benefits than process time, but delaying immersive tasks doesn’t necessarily delay other people or processes on your behalf
			- (Immersive time are tasks and projects that are not dependent on others, such as self-improvement projects)
			  id:: 62cad74a-2054-44b7-a12f-089aff2375a2
		- Quickly discerning whether tasks require immersive or process time is crucial for being able to habitually make first moves, because process work is most effective when it happens sooner.
		- Get in the habit of determining what tasks require immersive versus process time, as in the previous exercise. In your Action list or calendar (which we detail in Course Three of this book), denote each process task with a small “℗.”+
		- Begin each day with 30 minutes of scheduled process time—starting, unlocking, and unblocking the work of others.
		  id:: 62cad74a-46e1-4a38-8e81-534ab5f015ef
		- Use your process time for communication, requests, and the like. Try to constrain check-ins during immersive time.
		- **Alternate blocks of process and immersive work throughout your day. The more management responsibilities you have, the more process time you need in your day.**
		  id:: 62cad74a-9f73-469e-965a-adf427335adb
		- Schedule process time directly after meetings. After a long, immersive meeting, make process time to digest and set action items in motion, whether by marking them on your schedule or Action list or by delegating them
		  id:: 62cad74a-d546-402b-a2f7-ab3695365fff
		- Get in the habit of marking down every Action, whether an incoming task is given in person or via electronic communication
		- Move immediately on small process tasks (quick answers to e-mails, signing papers), especially during your process times.

	- Finishing Actions
	  collapsed:: true
		- Aside from the goal of delivering the product, the virtues of finishing are twofold.
			- In the physical realm, finishing yields precious space. Most cooks work in tight spaces, and their workstations must move through several phases of mise-en-place throughout the day: prep, cooking, service. A clean and efficient service is impossible when your station is still covered with the remains of bulk prep work. Finishing those actions conserves space and clears space for the next actions.
		- Better to confront the reasons why we stop before finishing and learn mental and physical techniques to push through. Better to enjoy the temporal, physical, and mental dividends of finishing than pay the price later for not doing so. Better to not open too many projects at a time so that I keep orphaned tasks to a minimum and give myself a fighting chance at finishing them. And better to deal with the incomplete by finding a way to tie it up, temporarily, so that it doesn’t crowd precious physical and mental space.
		- The very nature of the kitchen’s product demands that chefs develop a finishing mentality. Dishes, for the most part, are all-or-nothing. A chef cannot serve a steak au poivre without the peppercorn sauce, at least not if she expects to keep customers who know the difference. A menu cannot promise fries on the side and fail to deliver them. And let’s presume, just for the sake of argument, that the customer isn’t so discerning. The customer can’t be served at all unless the cook puts a plate in the pass. A bunch of dishes in various stages of completion are useless until at least one of them is finished. Ninety percent done is still zero percent done from the perspective of the customer. So a cook must develop a delivery mind-set.
		- **Finishing actions clears the mind as much as it clears the plate. An action once finished does not need attention or memory.**
			- An unfinished action still needs both to be completed. An accumulation of unfinished actions creates a mental clutter and a brain drain.
				- Whether we possess the kind of mind that deals with that clutter easily or not, the cataloguing and prioritization of those remaining actions demands mental energy that could be spent elsewhere.
		- Chefs say two seemingly contradictory things. On one hand, they counsel the importance of making first moves immediately. On the other, they loathe the incomplete: Don’t start what you can’t finish
			- But how can we start and finish everything? We can’t. Chefs are saying something more subtle: “Starting” is less about doing everything immediately and more about creating a triage system to prioritize current and future actions. **“Finishing” is not so much about completing everything and more about not being distracted by the periodic “starting” of other things.** “Finishing” can also be stopping a project while it’s incomplete but taking just an extra few seconds to wrap it up for resumption later so as to not leave loose ends hanging. What chefs attempt to avoid are orphaned tasks—things that take up physical and mental space because they haven’t been tied up in the easiest possible form to be resumed later. And since the polarities of starting and finishing generate tension between them, we must always begin with the end in mind. When you start a project, ask one question: How and when will I finish?
		- **Try to break large projects into chunks that are finishable in the time you allot for them.**
			- Set benchmarks. For example, I know I can usually write 500 words in 1 to 2 hours. So I break writing projects down into chunks of that size, and try not to assign myself more than that amount so I can actually finish what I’ve started. Smaller goals lift the spirits because they make it easier for us to see the end. To recap: 1.Figure out the discrete parts of each project. 2.Build your pause points with intentionality. 3.Work intently toward those points.
		- When so many of us beg the Universe for a chance to just get some work done, why is it that when that time finally arrives, we often do anything we can to escape it?
			- Here’s why: The process tasks we complain about are often easier to do than immersive work, and we get a little endorphin rush every time we deliver on one of those process tasks.
				- Immersive work is harder. It doesn’t yield those little rushes as often. Because it’s creative and thus a reflection of ourselves, it puts our own demands and emotions front and center. Is it any wonder, then, why we abandon our creative work to chat on social media or browse the Internet?
		- **We should always be unblocking stuck projects so we can finish them**. For every major goal, project, or mission, we should ask the question: What’s stopping me from moving forward? What has stopped the process?
		- Perfectionism comes from either of two emotional sources: fear of failure, or despair over its impending arrival. And there are two kinds of perfectionists: those who quit their projects, and those who keep working on them forever. Both are afraid, but the former copes by stopping work, and the latter by working indefinitely.
		- Remember: **Striving for perfection and perfectionism aren’t the same thing. Both the striver and the perfectionist aim toward an ideal. But the striver knows that excellence is not about creating something of the highest quality; it’s delivering something of the highest quality, with all the constraints that delivery entails—deadlines, expectations, contingencies, feedback. The chef cannot tinker forever with a dish: Customers get hungry. Food spoils. The chef must deliver.**
		- Creativity—what we do when our hands are shaping something, whether words or numbers or designs or images or music—isn’t linear. Booking yourself into some immersive time and then treating it like a 2-hour prison to attempt to squeeze every second out of it is a huge mistake. Our creative sessions need to breathe, as we do. We need mental, physical, and social breaks. Working clean with obligations and expectations means that we should strive to make breaks intentional ones.
	- Slowing Down to Speed Up
	  collapsed:: true
		- The mere act of talking tough ended Sosa’s hazing period, which in turn relaxed him. As he relaxed, he began to behave in a way that didn’t come naturally to him: He slowed down. As he slowed down, he made fewer mistakes. As he made fewer mistakes, he regained the finesse he needed to compete in the kitchen of Jean Georges. Sosa acquired what he refers to as equilibrium—an elegant balance of speed and refinement. Now his movements were becoming ninja-worthy: less lurching, more smooth. When he caught a mistake, he didn’t panic. If he didn’t cut the carrots correctly, Sosa stopped, took a breath, cleaned up, and began again, cutting them to perfection.
		- **The basic concept is this: The natural human tendency in the face of imminent deadline is to rush or panic. Don’t rush; when you rush, your movements become sloppy. Don’t panic; when you panic, you forget things.**
		  id:: 62d5a9ca-c9e3-40a1-a5ea-c58c40709d2c
			- When you find yourself rushing or panicking or both, just stop. Breathe. If your anxiety compels you to move, then clean. The act of cleaning, of wiping down your station, will force you to take some breaths. Look around you. Think about where you are and where you need to be. Think of the next step to get you there and take that step, slowly.
		- Slowing down does two important things for a cook. It steadies the body, allowing for smoother, more precise movements. And it helps the mind break down a series of movements into their constituent parts. Those two elements give slowing down its ultimate value: Slowness is the only way a cook can access quality velocity. The wiring of our brain makes this so.
		  id:: 62d5a9ca-d958-4f07-bfe2-abd424e05d22
		- Here’s the interesting part: Myelinization “wires” the quality of our movement, thought, and practice. So if you’re repeating an action sloppily, that sloppiness will be what myelinization preserves. And if you’re repeating an action precisely, that precision will be what myelinization enshrines instead. Adding speed to the “precise” movement may compromise that precision, but adding speed to the “sloppy” movement won’t make that movement any more precise. In the duality between speed and precision, precision must always precede speed, like that adage attributed to football titan Vince Lombardi: “Practice does not make perfect. Only perfect practice makes perfect.”
		  id:: 62d5a9ca-7d9f-4065-87ad-5bef93aa5660
		- Chefs believe that the state of their physical space not only has an effect on their minds, but on their perception of time. If your station is dirty, your day itself becomes compressed. If your station is clean, your day springs open. If you’re worried about time, that worry will show up in your physical space. If you’re calm about time, your workspace will be clear.
		- **Slowing down to speed up suggests another way to be in this moment. When Yvette feels like stopping, instead of distracting herself, she can just make her moves very slow. She can type slowly—one key at a time.** If she needs to gather files, she moves very slowly in getting these, smoothly, like a ballet. When she calls someone for information, she dials lazily, even making her own voice relaxed. She opens each motion up. She breathes through each little thing. She still hates it, but now her tasks become more like a game or a moving meditation
		  id:: 62d5a9ca-de8f-4c8f-9165-e33d2505f225
			- The work is still getting done, albeit at a snail’s pace, but the difference is this: (1) She hasn’t given up her control, which is what she’d do if she decided to start browsing the Web; (2) She still has forward momentum, if languid; (3) She gives herself more time to think and be mindful of each action, which is the opposite of freaking out or shutting down in the face of an avalanche of work; and (4) She breaks down her actions into their constituent parts, which, as we did in the above exercise, is a time-tested method of getting large projects done, but not normally how we relate to smaller, more mundane activities like writing an e-mail or preparing for a meeting. But even tasks that are small in terms of labor and time can loom large for us, so using the same breakdown tools for small tasks can penetrate our resistance.
			- **The more the resistance, the slower you move. But don’t disengage. You can use this slow-but-don’t-stop technique for just about anything that you don’t want to do**: getting out of bed in the morning (move left leg, move right leg, shift body, feet on floor), washing the dishes (move plate, turn faucet on, soak plate, grab sponge, move hand in a circular motion).
		- **In times of stress or panic, clean your workstation—your desk and/ or your computer—so that your visual field is clear. Put things where they belong. Close apps. Keep your hands moving, slow, slower.** Now take another breath and look around. Think about the next thing you need to do. Chain your tasks together, chain your movements together. Now resume, slowly, steadily, smoothly. Keep breathing beautifully
			- What are the things in your workspace demanding more awareness? Make a list of the communication you tend to miss regularly or on occasion. Do you overlook e-mails? Do you mishear or space out in meetings? Do you take too long to hear when colleagues call to you?
			- What are the things in your workspace needing less awareness? Do computer and phone alerts interrupt you too much? Do nearby conversations distract you? Do you find that your inner thoughts and daydreams tug at your focus?
		- Commit to working smoothly and steadily. Use physical order to restore mental order. Don’t rush.
	- Call and Callback
	  collapsed:: true
		- The office has much to learn from the professional kitchen: Don’t act like you have all the time in the world, and that goes double for how you treat the time of the people who work for you. **Endeavor to make the work lives of your employees, your colleagues, and your bosses easier, and the first way to do that is to treat their time, and yours, as a precious commodity. Strive, like chefs do, to work clean with communication.**
		  id:: 62d5a9ca-7d5a-4038-a154-cbc792b87895
		- Confirmation is only the first of four levels of callback.
		  id:: 62d5a9ca-d26a-455d-aef8-a4ff5390f481
			- Confirmation—a simple reply to acknowledge receipt of a piece of communication (“Got it!”)
			- Routing—a reply to delay, direct, deflect, defer, or refer the sender or issue in question (“Will reply by tomorrow.”)
			- Simple answer—requiring nothing more than a yes, no, or a specific piece of information (“I will meet you at 5:00 p.m.”)
			- Detailed answer—any reply requiring more than about a minute of your time
		- **In all this communication, the good habits of active listening and mirroring will go a long way to keep your relationships solid and your communication tight, help you remember essential actions, and put a lot of the small but deliverable process work behind you.**
		- Action language helps in meetings where people need to make those distinctions. Direct those around you to those requests by asking the right kinds of questions: What’s the consensus here? What’s the takeaway? What’s the next step? Who needs help? How can I help?
	- Inspect and Correct
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Inspect and correct is how the chef approaches perfection, “approach” being the operative word in that phrase, because perfection is never achieved**. At most, what the great chef can accomplish is meticulous execution, a phrase that kitchen designer Jimi Yui borrowed from Chef Gray Kunz. Meticulous execution encompasses the ambition of a chef, but also a bit of her stoicism: You can only do what you can do.
		  id:: 62da2438-d913-49d6-9c82-bdb4ca251c31
		- Cooks must internalize what they’ve been taught and learn how to evaluate their work in the way their chefs do. *(compare your work to someone who is an expert in what you do)*
		  id:: 62da2438-12d8-4836-adb1-bb04a6d0b839
			- I tell new cooks, ‘Look at your station as if it’s your restaurant and everybody is coming in to critique your restaurant,’” Telepan says. “‘You have to keep it organized and clean in the way you want your restaurant to be when you grow up to be a chef. So how you treat your station now is how your restaurant is gonna run. Now is the time to learn those habits.’”
		- Cooks cut corners because of laziness, or forgetfulness, or fatigue, or sometimes embarrassment at having discovered their own mistake. “I always say to them that it’s worse for them to have me find out than to say, ‘Chef, I fucked up, I missed this, I gotta make it again.’ I love that. Because it happens. In the kitchen, the machines are human.”
		- **Chefs transform failure into success by incorporating mistakes into their workflow—or rather, incorporating the solutions to prevent those mistakes. Thus cooks learn that failure is always an opportunity.**
		  id:: 62da2438-b09e-4b23-b2bc-adb7bb1841a2
		- **If perfectionism is the quest for quality at the expense of delivery, then settling for less is the quest for delivery at the expense of quality. Excellence itself is a compromise between the two: quality delivered**
		  id:: 62da2438-1bc8-4897-b6d8-7b36d88f14fe
		- We need in our world of work the means to evaluate our own work and that of others. We need the means to refine our methods and product, and to incorporate the knowledge gained from our failures. **If we don’t have mentors, the responsibility falls on us to create a personal culture of checks and balances, of inspection and correction, so we can work clean with feedback.**
		  id:: 62d5a9ca-2150-48a2-b982-9f7211682d86
		- Change your environment. If you’re looking for different perspective on your work, change the place in which you review it. For folks who write on a computer, an example of this would be printing your work out
		- Bring different senses into the mix. If you create something to be read with your eyes, for example, evaluate it by listening with your ears. One example for a writer would be reading your work aloud, slowly, or in a foreign accent
		- **Create an inner dialogue. Assume the identity of someone else who might lend some needed perspective to your work and have an inner dialogue with him. How might he evaluate your work?**
		  id:: 62da2438-8398-492a-9d16-8d4416a60641
		- **Commit to coaching yourself, to being coached, and to coaching others. Evaluate yourself**
		  id:: 62d5a9ca-d628-43ce-ae22-9ac4f678a88e
		- Chefs save motion to save time. Conserving motion conserves the time it takes to move. Conserving motion also conserves a tremendous amount of human energy, both physical and mental, as in refining a task by finding a better process or transforming the motion into an automatic reaction so the mind can be free to think other things
		- Chefs save time to save resources. Time is the beating heart that compels both human hunger and the microbes that spoil food. Conserving time preserves the customer and the food. Conserving time also liberates human energy, both mental and physical. Being able to work in compressed time gives us more of the one thing we cannot manufacture.
	- Total Utilization

		- **Just as there should be no wasted words, no words should lay people to waste. Anger wastes people**
		- Kindness is a relatively new concept for the professional kitchen.
	- The Commitments of Working Clean
		- COMMITMENT PUTS US IN PLACE
			- The entrance requirement for mise-en-place is commitment. The two terms are actually linguistic cousins. The French word mise and the English word commitment both derive from the Latin verb mettre, meaning “to put.” When we practice mise-en-place, we “put ourselves” in place. When we commit, we literally “put ourselves” with something or someone. Mise-en-place is the commitment we put in place to put ourselves in place, to make ourselves ready for life
		- **Cooks with commitment build lasting careers. Cooks without it lurch through spotty, unimpressive ones. Success without commitment can only come from luck or genius.** And most people don’t fathom how much commitment it takes for a genius to rise from obscurity to acclaim. Watch any genius in action and you’ll see a genius in action.

			- Genius isn’t a noun; it’s a verb. Excellence requires commitment; your commitment demands adherence to your mise-en-place, your practice, your system. Anything else and you, too, will be counting on luck or genius.
		- COMMITTING TO VALUES
			- **When we work clean we commit to the three values of mise-en-place—preparation, process, and presence.** These values take on a different flavor when taken out of the kitchen, but their essence remains the same
			- Value 1: **Commit to preparation with a 30-minute daily planning session**.
				- Take 30 minutes every day to clear your workstation and plan the next day, a daily personal mise-en-place called the Daily Meeze. The Daily Meeze is the central, nonnegotiable habit of m working clean.
			- Value 2: **Commit to a process that makes you better**.
			  id:: 62da2438-107b-476a-ad8d-df3c44759d1b
				- Now that you’ve prepared your plan, you must follow it. And if you want to get better at what you do, you must examine the results of your plan and your product and make corrections.
				- **Commitment to a process that makes you better means following the schedule you’ve set for yourself, using checklists, and cultivating better techniques and “life hacks.”**
				- It means incorporating the values and habits of working clean into your workday.
				- It also means a commitment to the inverse: altering or abandoning processes that make you worse.
					- How can you tell whether a process makes you better or worse? Understand first that what we’re after is excellence, not productivity. Productivity is working hard. Excellence is working clean. Plenty of well-meaning people equate working hard with a work ethic. But what’s so ethical about working wastefully into the night while the people you love wait for you? A work ethic must include ethics or it isn’t worth a damn. Any process that helps you balance your professional obligations with your personal ones is a process that makes you better
			- Value 3: **Commit to being present in whatever you do**.
				- Working clean requires your presence on a number of levels. The first level demands that you be and stay present physically: that you show up for yourself and for your fellows, and also that you don’t give up on yourself or them. Japanese cooks have a great word for this behavior: keizo-ku. The second level demands that you be and stay present mentally: becoming one with the work, being “with” the work but also “with” your comrades at the same time. This manifestation of presence—to be focused and open—is the goal of mise-en-place: Commit to the plan and the process yet remain aware of the shifting circumstances around you.
		- **Planning is prime—working clean with time**
			- Planning is first thought, not afterthought. Right planning promotes right action, saves time, and unlocks opportunity. Planning entails the scheduling of tasks, which means being honest with time, respecting both your abilities and limitations. What to do. Commit to being honest with time. Plan daily
		- **Arranging spaces, perfecting movements—working clean with space and motion**
			- Creating ergonomic workspaces means more than making things look pretty. It means setting a place for yourself that allows economy of motion and consumes less physical and mental energy. The less you move, the more effortless your work will be and the more brain-power you can reserve for new work and new thoughts. What to do. Commit to setting your station and reducing impediments to your movements and activities. Remove friction.
		- **Cleaning as you go—working clean with systems**
			- All systems are useless unless maintained. The real work of organization is not being clean, but working clean: keeping that system no matter how fast and furious your pace is. Working clean helps you work faster and better. What to do. Commit to maintaining your system. Always be cleaning.
		- **Making first moves—working clean with priorities**
			- The present moment is worth more than a future one because present action sets processes in motion and unlocks others’ work on your behalf. What to do. Commit to using time to your benefit. Start now.
		- **Finishing actions—working clean with obligations and expectations**
			- A project that is 90 percent complete is zero percent complete because it’s not deliverable. Orphaned tasks create more work. What to do. Commit to delivering. When a task is nearly done, finish it. Always be unblocking.
		- **Slowing down to speed up—working clean with emotions**
			- Precision precedes speed. A calm body can calm the mind. What to do. Commit to working smoothly and steadily. Use physical order to restore mental order. Don’t rush.
		- **Open eyes and ears—working clean with your senses**
			- Excellence requires both focus and awareness. Ambition, ability, and attunement can cultivate awareness. What to do. Commit to balancing internal and external awareness. Stay alert.
		- **Call and callback—working clean with communication**
			- Efficient teams become an interconnected nervous system. Excellence requires active listening. What to do. Commit to confirming and expecting confirmation of essential communication. Call back.
		- **Inspect and correct—working clean with feedback**
			- Mastery is never achieved; it is a constant state of evaluation and refinement. What to do. Commit to coaching yourself, to being coached, and to coaching others. Evaluate yourself.
	- **Total utilization—working clean with resources**
		- The grand ideal of working clean is no wasted space, no wasted motion, no wasted resource, no wasted moment, no wasted person. What to do. Commit to valuing space, time, energy, resources, and people. Waste nothing.
	- **There are two ways to succeed,” says Chef Alfred Portale. “One is to be a genius, and the other is to be better prepared and work harder.** And the latter is where I fall. My kitchen is never in the weeds. We can handle any volume. If you make sure that your mise-en-place is done perfectly, you are 90 percent of the way there.
	- Taking a half-hour to clear your plate and plan your day ahead imparts serenity to your life. It offloads and logs all the things your mind, your devices, your bags, and your body have been carrying, and it provides vital assurance that you’ll consult that log on a daily basis without fail. In that sense, doing your 30-minute Daily Meeze can be as beneficial to your physical, mental, and spiritual health as nutrition, hygiene, exercise, or meditation.
	- **Striving for productivity alone presents a danger in that a quest for productivity often crosses the line between valuing process and fetishizing it. Productivity is not the solution to all problems. Humans are beings with other commitments and considerations. We need work and we need rest. We need periods of focus and also times of aimlessness. We need time for ourselves and time for others. Without balance, the work will suffer in the long term anyway. Committing to productivity alone is like committing to only inhaling, never exhaling. That kind of commitment will kill you**.
	- Committing to presence means that we cultivate a practice of listening. When you listen, where are your eyes? Are they on your computer screen or phone, or are they on the person speaking? When you listen, where is your body? Is it pointed into the conversation, or away from it? When you listen, where is your mouth? Is it fixed to speak, or is it relaxed and open? When you listen, where is your nose? Are you breathing slowly, or is your breath held? When you listen, where is your mind? Are you hearing the words and using your mind to divine the subtext, or are you listening to your own inner narrative? Being able to listen with the coordination of your entire being, body and mind, is perhaps the most powerful human skill. It’s also one of the hardest things to do, which is another way of saying you will only get better at it if you practice. The better you listen, the more control you will have to wield your powers of attention in more complex ways. The better your focus, the more you’ll be able to extend that focus over a greater area
	- Committing to presence means that we cultivate an ability to be deliberate. When you decide to do something, get it done. When you set an appointment with someone else or yourself, show up. When you say “yes,” mean yes. When you say “no,” mean no. When you say “11:30,” mean 11:30. Guard against forces that distract you from the tasks at hand. The cultivation of deliberation works the same way as the cultivation of listening: Better listeners can listen to more things, and better actors can act on more things
	- Committing to presence means that we cultivate discreteness, boundaries between our work and our personal lives. We don’t lose focus and do a bunch of mindless personal stuff to disengage at work. And we don’t check our work e-mail when we get bored while we’re playing with our kids. We avoid scattering our energies in a way that prevents our full presence in either setting. We are “in” or “out,” “on” or “off.” Wherever we are, we’re there.
