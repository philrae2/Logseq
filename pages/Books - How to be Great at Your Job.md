- Notes:
	- Be early. Be accurate. Earn trust.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Earn trust
			- **It is more important for our external image and others to perceived us as trustable over smart.** We will earn more respect as trustworthy than intelligent. Trusted to be on time. Trusted to deliver a quality product or solution. Trusted to be accountable (to do what you said you were going to do)
			- Every time you turn in a report with a missing number, an incorrect formula, or a misspelled word you are saying, “I don’t care enough.” Every  time you miss a deadline (even by fifteen minutes) you are saying, “You  can’t trust me.” It sounds harsh, but small mistakes can have a cumulative  effect on your reputation and your ability to get promoted.
			- Office politics ebb and flow. But building a reputation  as someone who delivers complete information in a timely manner (early)  is the secret to long-term, sustainable success in the workplace.
			- **Being accurate and being early—that is all that matters, so keep it simple: Do good work. Turn it in on time or ahead of time, if you can. Repeat.**
		- Be Accurate
			- **Being accurate is more important than being early, because if people don’t believe what you’re saying they won’t care when, where, or how you say it. Simply put, being accurate is the foundation of your reputation at work.**
			- **It is far better to be a bit slower—and more accurate—than a bit faster and wrong. Understand this. Live this.**
			- Being accurate is about more than just having the right number on an Excel spreadsheet. It is about delivering the right information at the right time in the right format. In my experience there are two behaviors that can help you ensure accuracy: breathing and asking questions.
			- Breathe and slow down. Haste makes waste.
				- Create your own mental checklist of things that could go wrong, and don’t 
				  let them go wrong. Every detail matters, so take the extra thirty seconds, 
				  breathe, and check your work carefully.
				- If you make small mistakes on a regular basis (more than once per week),  it doesn’t matter how smart you (think you) are, people won’t like working with you.

			- When answering questions:
				- Rather than being overanxious to always have an answer on the spot, take a deep breath and think before you speak. People will notice if you tell a half-truth or your answer is jumbled and confusing. In fact, it is far better to admit you don’t know the answer and instead offer to follow up within twenty-four hours, rather than fake it.
			- Ask clarifying questions:
				- **If someone asks you to do something, make sure you are 100 percent clear on what it is they actually want. Accepting vague direction from a boss, or anyone in the workplace can be as dangerous to your reputation as your own laziness.**
				- If something isn't clear, ask questions until you have all the information you need to proceed. This includes clarifying formats, file locations, timing, etc. . . .
				- Your ability to deliver good work is wholly dependent on your ability to get good inputs and clear directions. An extra thirty seconds of questions can often translate into hours of saved time (for you and your boss) by avoiding frustrating misunderstandings that result in extra work.
				- __Simply put: if you don't understand something, ask questions until you do.__
		- Be early
			- Ninety-two percent of your problems at work will go away if you show up to work earlier than you did yesterday. How early depends on your particular situation, but make no mistake: the secret to work-life balance, good relationships with your coworkers, and early promotions all rests on your ability to get to work early and turn in your work early. (Oh, and don’t forget to leave work early—seriously—leave work early.)
			- Get to work early If you want to be amazing at your job, get to work one hour early. Showing up to work at the same time as everyone else is a ticket to mediocrity—and a slow promotion. One hour of work in peace and quiet is worth two hours in the office when other people are there, meetings are happening, and you’re distracted.
			- > There’s another upshot to getting to work early that’s less tangible but just as important: you begin to build the perception that you are a top performer
				- Look around at the other people that show up early. I bet you they are the most successful people in the company. This means something. It also means something if these people are seeing you at work early. As LeBron James once tweeted: "Game recognizes game."
			- Turn in your work early
				- **Always aim to deliver your work twenty-four hours in advance of a deadline.**
				- And when it comes to those situations when you can’t turn in your report twenty-four hours in advance, I recommend that you still send an email to your boss by 5:00 p.m. the day prior, giving them the status update and reassuring them of your progress: “I’m working on it. I just need to finalize a few details—but I will send to you by X-hour tomorrow.”
				- __Your goal is to control the flow of communication and stay ahead of your boss’s concerns. __
					- If your boss has to send an email asking about the project, you should interpret this as a signal that they are feeling anxious and you have missed an opportunity to update them.
		- Leave work early
			- Don’t make the mistake of believing that if you work late people will think you’re a hard worker. If you work late, people will think you’re behind, you can’t keep up, you’re overwhelmed, you don’t have a life, you’re late on a project—in short, you’re not good at your job.
	- Meet with your boss weekly
	  collapsed:: true
		- If you don’t meet with your boss on a weekly basis, you are going to have a hard time being successful at your job. This meeting should be a dedicated thirty-minute block that is regularly scheduled every week. If it isn’t happening, ask for it. In fact, demand it (politely, of course).
		- The purpose of this meeting is to stay on the same page as your boss by sharing timely updates, getting approvals, and resolving open issues. This is your meeting. You should schedule it. You should set the agenda. And you should lead it.
			- Don’t leave anything to chance, because without this meeting it will be impossible for you to manage expectations and get credit for all the work you do. In fact, if you don’t have this meeting, you are conceding control of your career to your boss— and we both know that the chances you have a good boss are less than 50/50—so don’t screw this up.
		- Don’t schedule on a Monday— there are too many things happening on a Monday. And don’t schedule on a Friday—no one likes meetings on a Friday. You want to aim for early morning if possible, because if the meeting is scheduled for late afternoon on a Tuesday, there’s a high likelihood that other meetings will take priority or your boss will run late and you’ll lose your scheduled time. If your meeting time keeps getting moved, identify and recommend a better time that can become consistent.
		- SEND AN AGENDA:
			- Email your boss a bullet-point list of topics by 5:00 p.m. the day prior to your weekly meeting. Doing so ensures that the meeting is not canceled, helps you organize your own thoughts, and gives your boss a heads up in case they need to prepare for a certain topic or decision. Sending an agenda says, “I’m awesome. I’m organized. I’m good at my job.”
		- LEAD THE MEETING:
			- **It is critical that you go into the meeting with the mind frame that it’s your meeting to run. You set the agenda, you lead the discussion, you ask the questions, you get the answers.** Come prepared with specific questions. What exactly do you need an answer on? Have all the facts ready so your boss can make a decision on the spot. Your job is to make it easy for them to say yes.
	- How to work with people
		- Overcommunicate
		  collapsed:: true
			- It is your responsibility to tell people (especially your boss) what you are doing, as well as when and how you are going to do it. Your goal should be to try and get credit for a project at least three times (beginning, middle, end), rather than once (only when you turn it in).
			- It’s everything that happens before and during the project that ultimately influences people’s perception of your ability to get things done.
			- > Communication goes two ways—inbound and outbound. Your goal should be to increase your outbound communication (updates, progress reports, agendas) as much as possible in order to limit (and head off) inbound questions and concerns. The more you tell people what you are doing (outbound), the less they will try and tell you what you need to do (inbound).
			- The key point is that most people don’t consider the importance of their boss’s experience during the journey to complete a project. Most people are so focused on themselves and their own experience—“I finished the project on time, so what’s the problem?”—that they completely miss the fact that their boss was left in the dark with no visibility to progress along the way.
				- Think of it this way: each time your boss asks you if you are working on the project, what they are really saying is: “I’m feeling anxious because I haven’t heard from you, and I’m worried that the work won’t get done.”
				- Because the project required multiple inquiries from your boss, they may walk away from the experience feeling that it was their follow-ups that ensured the project was delivered on time. This leads to a situation where your boss may walk away from the project and feel like they did all the work—not you.
				- Don’t overthink it by being worried that a small update is meaningless or a waste of your boss’s “precious” time. Trust me, your boss would far prefer getting too many updates versus chasing you around like a babysitter trying to find out what you are up to.
					- **Don’t worry about asking for permission to send updates—just start doing it.** If it ever becomes too much, they will tell you. (In my seventeen years of corporate experience I’ve never had a boss ask me to keep them in the dark or share less information with them, so I wouldn’t be too worried about this happening.)
		- Make it easy to say yes
		  collapsed:: true
			- When it comes to getting approvals, it is your responsibility to make it easy for the other person to say yes. Whether you want approval for a $1 million budget or approval of your vacation time, the key is to start small and be specific, while also anticipating people’s concerns
			- **Start small**: I only asked for fifteen minutes. Everyone has fifteen minutes. Sure, you may want more time than fifteen minutes, but your first goal is to get a “yes” (however small) and build from there. Take your big request and break it into bite-size chunks that are more easily swallowed.
			- **Be specific AND flexible**: When trying to get to yes, it is important for you to understand what is essential and what is flexible. In this case, it doesn’t matter if I get coffee with the person this week or four weeks from now, so I combined my specific minimal request (fifteen minutes) with a big window of opportunity (three to four weeks), thus increasing the likelihood that the person can’t say no—thus leading to a yes.
			- **Flattery will get you everywhere**: ^^Everyone is human, and as such, everyone likes to hear they’re doing a good job. Even the CEO wants someone to slap them on the back and say, “Great presentation!”— so why not you? (Hint: The more specific your compliment, the more genuine it will feel.)^^
