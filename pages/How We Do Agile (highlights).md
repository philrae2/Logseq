	- In keeping with the intent of its creators, we think of Agile in terms of the principles it invokes rather than in terms of specific processes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jmca43zs27ntng3zr2tm2n))
	- Palantir has a simple business model: develop software and ensure it is valuable to our customers. This model gives rise to two core organizations: Product Development (PD) writes software, and Business Development (BD) helps our customers make the best possible use of our platforms and their data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jmczb7vr4btmrwvf5yxn1a))
	- **PD** itself is organized in three main groups: one for [Gotham](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/), one for [Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/), and one for our deployment infrastructure. Each of these platforms comprise a large number of micro-service-shaped components developed by distinct teams. Teams typically have five-ish members filling a variety of roles: developer, designer, product manager. There is no 1–1 correspondence between roles and humans (i.e., some folks may cover multiple roles) and one of the members is the designated team lead. The development teams are spread out across our main offices in Palo Alto, New York, Washington D.C., Seattle, and London. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jmde7qgsc8pbkm4bkbw29e))
	- **BD** is organized in two groups by customer segment (private sector and government). Each customer is supported by a Palantir implementation team that deploys our software and helps the customer scope use cases, implement workflows, train users and developers, and implement bespoke functionality. Implementation teams are based at offices around the world and spend much of their time on site at customers’ corporate offices, production facilities, research labs, etc. Depending on the depth and breadth of the customer engagement, headcount of an implementation team can range from one to dozens of Palantirians.

	- We believe in hiring excellent people and put a tremendous amount of trust into those who have joined us. With trust comes autonomy, starting on day one. New joiners are often shocked the first time they’re empowered — or even asked — to solve a complex problem the way they think it should be solved. It’s not that tenured Palantirians aren’t there for guidance and support; however, the baseline is always “*try it yourself and ask for help when you need it*” rather than “*you should do it this way*”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jmhdxrb16gnm2mmtkhgx8j))
	- Trust and autonomy imply ownership, and ownership is one of the main sources of our employees’ motivation and productivity. Or, to quote the Agile manifesto, we should “*Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.*“ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jmtq3gwnbcnec9ny4g36ha))
	- When asked what Palantir’s ‘secret sauce’ is, I say that it’s the symbiosis between BD’s Forward Deployed Software Engineers who have direct access to users and their problems and PD’s Software Engineers who turn those insights into a product. Even the most motivated software development team struggles when they don’t understand what they’re building or why. Our model relies on BD to articulate the product capabilities our customers need to see transformative value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jmw35ww1ycz48vcrs3dtf9))
		- **Note**: There are gaps between OBI PMT and technical delivery teams.
	- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jmyj89ds5tm6vwtpr43tga))
	- Long-term, BD works with PD to synthesize their field experience into ideas and intuition for [entirely new product categories](https://hbr.org/2013/03/why-it-pays-to-be-a-category-creator). For example, Palantir Foundry was born out of BD. Its creators turned their experience struggling to implement collaborative data integration for our customers into Foundry’s core features such as [branching, provenance, and co-versioning of data and code](https://medium.com/palantir/on-dataset-versioning-in-foundry-8f23de22cc4c). The first couple years of Foundry development were driven by a whiteboarding session (see image) that captured the pain points we felt on site with customers as ideas for software architecture ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jn0wdwm796eskdsveda66s))
	- [Amy Edmondson’s research](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=wlnsR9i9b5cC) on psychological safety, intentional experimentation, and learning from failure has deeply shaped my understanding of Palantir’s innovation culture. In a nutshell, the argument goes like this: individuals are unlikely to take risks if they feel psychologically unsafe, if they feel that coworkers, leaders, or the organization as a whole punishes negative outcomes. Since innovation is fundamentally about experimentation, and since experiments can fail (by definition), it is critical for organizations that seek innovation to establish a [culture of encouraging and rewarding “successful failure”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Excellence). We seek to make sure we learn from our experiments so that failure is productive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jn9mjg3xv3n72wegerk0kh))
	- Second, every major failure is followed by a a [postmortem discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmortem_documentation) in which we try to identify root causes and brain storm solutions. These discussions are structured similar to [Five Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Whys), although we typically explore multiple paths similar to a [fault-tree analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis). We hold Five Whys not only for software bugs or outages, but also for leadership failures (“Person XYZ left the company because they did not feel valued as a contributor”), culture (“Our team event this year was not inclusive for minority group X”), or process (“We had 5 onsite candidates this morning, but only 4 interviewers were scheduled”). Importantly, Five Whys are not a mechanism for attributing individual faults, but to learn as an organization; our Five Whys reports all start with [Norm Kerth’s reminder](https://www.amazon.com/Project-Retrospectives-Handbook-Team-Reviews/dp/0932633447): *Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jnbprdf7enxjz3m408x3v2))
	- Internally, we disseminate both our success and failure stories broadly and openly. Everyone is encouraged to join our “wins” distribution list in which we celebrate what goes well, and all Five Whys reports are sent to a dedicated and widely read email list. Open and transparent communication is at the heart of our collaboration culture and is particularly important since our PD and BD teams must work together across geographic and time zone boundaries. We are heavy users of digital collaboration tools such as Email, Quip, and Slack. Where possible, we embrace an *open-by-default* access policy for distribution lists, documents, and discussion groups. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jnrsdnvdjvqyp81dxr3x7y))
	- For me, Agile methodology means to observe, to reflect, and to adapt. There’s no one Agile approach that works for every organization or situation and as such it seems foolish to advertise or prescribe one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jnvc9q0qz4k7zcdm85c2xd))
