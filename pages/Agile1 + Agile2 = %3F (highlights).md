	- Palantir implementation teams follow an Agile collaboration model, even if we don’t call it that internally; it’s just our way of working, our DNA. We don’t follow religiously a particular “textbook“ Agile implementation (like [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) or [DSDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_systems_development_method)), but our methodology shares many of their traits, for example:
	  
	  •   Teams discuss priorities and deliverables on weekly or fortnightly schedules. We often start a week with a 1h planning meeting, and end a week with a retrospective and demos of what we have achieved.
	  •   We track tasks and progress using tools like JIRA or Asana.
	  •   We test our progress with our users, minimally week-over-week, but ideally every day.
	  •   Teams self-organize around customer requirements and don’t follow top-down mandates or implementation plans.
	  •   Our people are our most precious resource. In contrast to Scrum, we adopt hybrid roles. For example, during the pilot, one of our [Deployment Strategists](https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/deployment-strategists) was both developing the software and acting as a joint product owner with their business partner in the customer team.
	  •   We strive to co-locate at customer locations in order to get more direct feedback from our users. When teams are geographically dispersed we use asynchronous communication tools like Slack and Quip and hold our daily stand-ups virtually ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jw0ktr7az8bjmbcwd15ewr))
	- we identified a number of problems:
	  
	  •   Our internal product backlog was not granular enough and was not shared with customer teams, limiting the customer developers’ understanding of feature work progress, upcoming changes, etc.
	  •   The Program Team did not have good oversight on the progress and blockers relating to specific features and products as these issues were typically addressed in meetings held directly with the relevant business stakeholders.
	  •   The delivery cycle was not uniform across the different use cases, features, and data products that our team was working on, meaning that our implementation partners did not have predictable timelines for our work outputs.

	- **Adapt**
	  
	  We discussed our findings with the customer and agreed on a couple of straightforward adaptations of our implementation methodology to address those shortcomings:
	  
	  •   Maintain a shared backlog across all products and developers to assist communication and visibility, including business tasks owned by non-engineering stakeholders.
	  •   Establish a uniform sprint cycle across all products to increase predictability around delivery.
	  •   Invite all customer and Palantir stakeholders to sprint planning and review sessions for improved transparency in product progress.
	  •   Schedule quarterly team retrospectives to assess progress against business impact and team value generation. In addition, hold “meta retrospectives” to discuss how we work together as a team. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0jxgkzw09978nf1tn7xxz0p))
	- Formulaic interpretations of Scrum or other versions of Agile can be a drag on resources because they require specific roles and define strict formats for how various events and artifacts are implemented. In many ways these can be contradictory to the core principles of Agile that champion adaptability in response to evolving constraints. When resources are limited, this is not practical, and so I believe it is best to adapt your methodology to respect the *intentions* of Agile rather than a formulaic implementation detail.

	- At Palantir, we do not evaluate the success of our implementation teams by their “Agile-ness”, but rather by their business impact and output, so any additional process overhead should enable these goals. We were able to achieve this by partnering closely with our customer team to find a collaboration model that worked for us all in the reality of our working context.
