	- The process Gehry follows from an idea to a finished building is based on trust. Trust produces power—and power gets projects done ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp1t1zwxj7qvh84h8j78trw))
	- Control was indispensable. He had to have it, and keep it, from beginning to end. He even coined a term for the setup he needed to be in control—“the organization of the artist”—with the creatives, that is, Gehry and his team, in charge. He has enforced this setup on every project since Disney Hall. It’s a root cause of his success ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp1whr8an5ejyb44n13k681))
	- If those in positions to grant power trust the project leader, she will have power; if they don’t, she won’t. As we’ll see, the process Gehry follows to take a project from an idea to a finished building has many virtues. But underlying all of them is the fact that his process is based on trust. Trust produces power—and power gets projects done. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp1xa4nsa5gkkvm63mvbytc))
	- Always Ask Why
	  
	  In 1991, when Gehry was invited to join the project that became the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, regional government officials acting as the client knew what they wanted. In the center of Bilbao, there was a huge old building with impressive towers and arches that had once been a wine warehouse. The officials wanted to transform it into a dramatic space for modern art and have the Guggenheim Foundation run it.
	  
	  With such a clearly defined project, another architect may have treated this as a simple choice: either accept or pass. Gehry did neither. Instead, he did what he does with every potential client. He asked questions, starting with the most fundamental: “Why are you doing this project?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp228rn2pvttnpvnz7jerg6))
	- What Gehry heard was that Bilbao is the heart of the Basque Country and was once a hub of heavy industry and shipping. But that was in the past. “Bilbao was not quite as bad as Detroit, but almost,” Gehry recalled several years later. “Steel industry gone. Shipping industry gone. It looked pretty sad.” Spain had an enormous tourism industry, but few people had even heard of Bilbao, let alone thought of going there. The officials told Gehry they wanted the museum to do for Bilbao what the Sydney Opera House had done for Sydney—give the city international prominence, draw tourists from around the world, and boost the economy.
	  
	  That was a lot of weight for any project to carry, and it was hard for Gehry to see how the project envisioned by the officials could deliver what they wanted. Although he liked the building they had selected, it wasn’t well suited to be a space for modern art. And when had a renovation ever had such a transformative effect? But understanding the goal of the project helped Gehry form a different vision that his clients could buy into. Gehry found a derelict site on the riverfront, next to a spectacular bridge, just like the Sydney Opera House. Build something audacious there, he suggested ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp244mv754vz9psdaqgwdq8))
		- **Note**: If you understand the request and goals of the client you’re able to offer alternative options that fulfills the project with more success.

	- Far too many projects proceed on the basis of undiscussed assumptions. That’s dangerous. As the old adage has it: “Don’t assume. Verify.” Gehry does this by asking why. Assumptions may mask disagreements about a project’s ultimate goals. As a result, the initial conception of the project may be off. And without clear agreement on the goal, it will be at greater risk of wandering off course when it encounters inevitable problems and complications. By starting projects with meaningful questioning, and by carefully listening to the answers, Gehry figures out what the clients really want rather than what they think they want. As Meaghan Lloyd, Gehry Partners’ chief of staff, told us: “Sometimes he produces something for the client that they don’t realize they want because [he] listens so well.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp28rtdscfxnph8e0abzh3p))
	- Starting with questions, and really listening, is unnatural. As the Nobel-laureate psychologist Daniel Kahneman has shown, people suffer from availability bias, letting their thinking rush ahead on the basis of whatever information they already happen to have. Gehry’s questions put a stop to that. “You’re being curious,” Gehry says. “And that curiosity leads to invention.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp3b3e9awth77nz79ztsqvs))
	- Simulate, Iterate, Test
	  
	  When prospective clients come to Gehry’s firm, they are walked through the development of past projects so that they understand Gehry’s process. That’s crucial because the discussion to shape the project’s initial conception is not the end of their involvement. It’s the beginning. “Some people aren’t up for it,” notes Lloyd. “It takes a brave person to work with us.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp5hyt2m57s9670yasmkea7))
	- It helps that Gehry seldom, if ever, speaks in high-flown theoretical terms, despite having studied art and architecture deeply. He is blunt. He expects the same in return. “Our communication is very basic and mostly visual, and there’s not a sophisticated language that we use,” says Craig Webb, a partner in Gehry’s firm. They look at models and say, “That’s good” or “That’s bad” or “I don’t like it.” Ideas that work are kept; those that don’t, go. The work takes priority over any bruised feelings.

	- Gehry’s team spent two years thinking through and simulating every detail, in effect building the museum on computers before they built it in reality.
	  
	  Solving this puzzle would have been impossible without CATIA, a computer-modeling technology modified from software originally created to design aircraft by the French aerospace giant Dassault. Gehry recognized long before most that if computer modeling were pushed to extremes, it could revolutionize design and construction by allowing architects to engage in relentless iteration and testing of every imaginable form, including curves that had once been impossible to build reliably.
	  
	  The result would be digital models that precisely mimicked the future building, providing exquisitely detailed plans that could be used by everyone from manufacturers to builders to operators. Starting with the Golden Fish sculpture designed for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, digital models have been key to all of Gehry’s designs, long before anyone came up with the term “digital twin.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp5vny8evxf26gxvraqw79k))
	- As open and fluid as Gehry’s process is, it is not formless. At various points, decisions are locked in. Work then proceeds on the next stages. The overall effect is to move smoothly from big ideas at the grand scale (What about a skyscraper twisted like licorice?) to increasingly fine-grained details (How do we design this window?). As a result, everything from the building’s relationship with its surroundings to the width of a windowsill has been subjected to severe scrutiny. It’s a long, exhausting process, but the resulting plan isn’t only unusually detailed. It is unusually reliable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp5wfsk8x3er4waayjvdwm5))
	- The client is involved throughout. “It’s a discussion,” Gehry says. “That’s why the model-making thing is great, because they can see it as we develop it, and understand what I’m agonizing about.” Gehry is seldom perfectly happy with anything. “I’m very open about that,” he says, and he frankly shares what he likes and what he doesn’t. He wants the same candor from the client, and when he gets it, he listens intently and synthesizes the client’s thinking into his own. “They see they’re involved,” Gehry says. “They’re invited into my thinking process. So they can see stuff. And they can say, ‘Oh no, I would never do that.’ They can feel like part of it. They see the evolution. I find that very powerful.”
	  
	  At key stages, when the project must commit to design decisions before work advances, the client must give approval. In this way, the design is enriched and strengthened by the client’s perspective, while the meeting of minds that begins the project continues, iteration after iteration, following the maxim, “Try, learn, again. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp6ath6m1zqww1r6mb304x6))
	- By contrast, the Guggenheim Bilbao, a building no less innovative and complex than the Sydney Opera House, took four years to build—exactly as forecast—because Gehry and his team had spent two years up front thinking through and simulating every detail, in effect building the museum on computers before they built it in reality.
	  
	  Gehry’s planning process may burn considerable time and feel slow, but overall his approach is much faster. And cheaper, because planning and delivery costs are wildly asymmetric: Spotting and correcting problems with the 8 Spruce Street facade by making thousands of iterations on a computer may not have been cheap in an absolute sense, but it cost a small fraction of what it would have to fix the same problems had they been discovered during installation. Relatively speaking, planning is cheap, delivery is expensive. And taking the time to think through the design means you can act much faster later.
