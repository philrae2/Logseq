- The challenge of the future
	- > In the most minimal sense, the future is simply the set of all moments yet to come. But what makes the future distinctive and important isn’t that it hasn’t happened yet, but rather that it will be a time when the world looks different from today. In this sense, if nothing about our society changes for the next 100 years, then the future is over 100 years away. If things change radically in the next decade, then the future is nearly at hand. No one can predict the future exactly, but we know two things: it’s going to be different, and it must be rooted in today’s world. Most answers to the contrarian question are different ways of seeing the present; good answers are as close as we can come to looking into the future.

- Types of progress:
	- vertical progress is doing new things. ex. new technologies
	- horizontal progress: doing the same things. ex. globalization
- To think and analyze clearly is to question what we think we know about the past. How much of what you know about the subject is shaped by the mistaken reaction to past mistakes? Think for ourselves and not necessarily follow the crowd. #[[first principles]]

- If you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity business.

	- All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.

- 4. The ideology of competition
	- Creative monopoly means new products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator. Competition means no profits for anybody, no meaningful differentiation, and a struggle for survival. Competition is ingrained from the very start of our lives in grade school and continuing to our adult careers.
	- People become obsessed with competition. Inside our workplaces, people lose sight of what matters and focus on their rivals instead. Rivalry causes us to overemphasize old opportunities and copy what has worked in the past.

- 5. Last Move Advantage
	- Characteristics of a monopoly
		- Every monopoly is unique but they usually share some combination of: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.
			- Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate. As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. The easiest way to get 10x improvement is to build something completely new.
	- Stop disrupting. Avoid competition as much as possible. If you truly want to make something new, the act of creation is far more important that the old industries that might not like what you create.

		- If we take this to a personal level. Don't compete with your coworkers. What can you offer to the organization that sets you apart and makes you valuable that no one else can replicate?

- 6. You are not a lottery ticket
	- Control your future by creating concrete plans. Create a definite view and have firm convictions. Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity, and calling it "well-roundedness", we can identify the one best thing and do it.

		- Be creative and original thinking in planning. Don't rehash already existing conventions, improve substantially, or invent something new.

- 8. Secrets
	- If you're afraid of being wrong, then don't look for secrets (do look for secrets!)
	- How to look for them:
		- Ask what secrets is nature not telling you?
		- What secrets are people not telling you?
		- The best place to look for secrets is where no one is looking for them.

- 9. Foundation
	- Most fights inside a company happen when people compete for the same responsibilities. Eliminating competition makes it easier for everyone to build the kinds of long-term relationships that transcend mere professionalism.  #competition

		- Be good at a few things, rather than mediocre on many skills.

- 12. Man and Machine
	- Instead of being afraid of computers, ask how technology can help you solve difficult problems. What in your workflow can you improve with technology? What processes and systems in the organization could be improved?
	- Technology is the one way to escape competition in a globalizing world.
	- **Seven questions that business must answer:** #[[Lessons Learned]] [[q: How do we build success?]]
		- 1. The Engineering Question
			- Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
		- 2. The Timing Question
			- Is now the right time to start your particular business
		- 3. The Monopoly Question
			- Are you starting with a big share of a small market
		- 4. The People Question
			- Do you have the right team?
		- 5. The Distribution Question
			- Do you have  away to not just create but deliver your product?
		- 6. The Durability Question
			- Will your market position be defensible in 10 and 20 years into the future?
				- Ask yourself where you and your organization will be years from now. Market yourself into the future, not just now.
				- Find and solve problems now, but also start looking for future problems and position yourself to take advantage.
		- 7. The Secret Quetion
			- Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?
				- Doing something different is what's truly good for society—and it's also what allows a business to profit  by monopolizing  a new market.
				- The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by the crowd; the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.
