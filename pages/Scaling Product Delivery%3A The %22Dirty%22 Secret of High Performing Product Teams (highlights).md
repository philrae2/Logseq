	- ***The dirty secret of Silicon Valley is that most great product teams follow a system that resembles waterfall (gasp!) to launch new innovative features/products repeatably***. The system starts with high conviction based on judgment, intuition, and instinct rather than relying on iterative customer feedback to build conviction over time.

		- **Note**: What are some examples of this? Does Apple as a hardware company use Agile or Lean approach?
	- The Religion of Agile or Lean
	  
	  "Agile" or "Lean" â€” processes that emphasize short development timelines and small iterations â€” have been heavily emphasized in Silicon Valley for the past decade. While there is a time and place for those systems, they:
	  
	  1.  Do not enable shipping big bets repeatably.
	    
	  2.  Lead companies/individuals to be less willing to take big swings.
	    
	  3.  Consistently fail companies when they realize they need a step function change. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h468c4k4edrjwf577d654hdn))
		- **Note**: What does step function change mean and why does agile or lean fail on this regard?
	- High\-performing product teams don't religiously subscribe to one tool for all problems. They recognize that through a company's lifetime, different problems arise that each requires a different tool. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h468ec68we7f5yk9g6d8k115))
	- "L*eading something that occurs in your team across a cross\-functional, cross\-team effort that requires dependencies, timelines, project plans, and all these new and complicated pieces can be career\-defining projects." \- Matt Greenberg \- CTO @ Reforge, Former VP Eng at Credit Karma*
	  
	  But many get stuck around steps 3 and 4.
	  
	  There are many reasons for this, but two big ones are:
	  
	  1.  **The Grey Area Grows**
	    
	    The larger scale the project the more ambiguity there is in strategic decisions and tactical tradeoffs. Engineers especially are trained to find the "right" answer. ***Leaders get bogged down in trying to make the best decision but increase the time you spend on the wrong decisions.*** You've probably experienced a discussion similar to "This is 3% better than that." But the real discussion is, does this matter? As you progress in your career, focusing on ways to get to fast, efficient, and reasonable solutions ends up being more important than coming to the "right" answer. This is a leap that many struggle with.
	    
	  2.  **Multiple Teams, Multiple Sequences**
	    
	    Larger projects involve figuring out how to execute across multiple teams that you do not directly own in multiple sequences. Your influence abilities need to move from explicit to implicit. But a lot of people struggle with "What do I do when I can't tell them what to do?" They want everyone to know they are in charge and to be blessed to make every decision. But they fail to see the problem as them and it leads them to build teams who see their efforts as "us against the world" with major efforts that end in frustration and animosity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h46kgr97gb5725rhbedqtqv6))
	- **No System**
	  
	  Some leaders have no standardized system to deliver large\-scale initiatives. Each product and engineering team will unintentionally build products through different methods, leading to inconsistent delivery timelines and product quality.
	  
	  How does this happen? ***Because we've all been trained that Waterfall is horrible and Agile is great***. As a result, very few companies are willing to put a system in place that isn't Agile\-informed, due to the backlash it could create. This leads the team to get stuck in small, iterative bets without the balance of shipping big bets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h46kx2bv6ktvk57wmbnym0v4))
	- **Applying The Wrong System**
	  
	  Applying the wrong system can be just as troublesome. Going from strategic idea to outcome is solving a series of problems. Different tools solve different problems. Applying the wrong tool to the wrong problem can manifest in all the issues described above. This most commonly comes in two forms. One, applying iterative systems with low process rigidity (like Agile) to large\-scale work. And two, forcing a system from one company to the next, such as applying the Amazon\-style press release to a culture that doesn't read. When the root cause is applying the wrong system, you often see overly complex models put in place at the wrong time like scaled agile team of teams or Spotify's matrixed organization applied at small\-scale companies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h46m1813m4gefepy2r2s2bsv))
	- "We have the wrong people."
	  
	  Companies commonly believe that it isn't a system problem but it is a people problem. They don't have the right type of people to execute this type of work. But you can get the "right" type of people (whatever that means), and if you plug them into the wrong system, the outcome is going to be exactly the same. Teams need to recognize that there is no unicorn that is going to save them. Anchoring on the belief that it's a team problem is almost always the signal that the root cause is a leadership issue. Leadership needs to give the teams a system that they can execute. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h46m337xvgmd9wzzaxy88951))
	- **Over\-Relying On "Superstars"**
	  
	  A lot of times teams have their "10X ninja superstar." The one or two people that the company trusts to rely on their intuition, take on big projects and deliver outcomes on time. The first trap is to keep feeding this person more big projects. However, superstar resources are an unreliable way to scale. Superstars can only take on so many projects and have a limited influence on the broader execution system. Over\-reliance on superstars, weakens the rest of the team.

	- Build A Specific System For Large Product Bets
	  
	  All product problems are not created equal. So why would we use one system to solve all types of product problems? In "[Product Work Beyond Product Market Fit](https://www.reforge.com/blog/product\-work\-beyond\-product\-market\-fit)," Casey Winters (Reforge Partner, CPO at Eventbrite) and Fareed Mosavat (Reforge GP, Former Slack) talked about how there are 4 different types of product problems, and treating them equally creates many problems:
	  
	  *"The life of any company starts with going from zero to one on initial product\-market fit. It is a requirement to reach before any other types of product work become a priority. But after product\-market fit, there are four categories of product problems.*
	  
	  â€¢   ***Feature Work \-*** *Creating and capturing value by extending a product's functionality and market into incremental and adjacent areas.*
	    
	  â€¢   ***Growth Work \-*** *Creating and capturing value by accelerating adoption and usage by the existing market.*
	    
	  â€¢   ***Scaling Work \-*** *Focusing on bottlenecks to ensure the team can continue to move forward and take on new levels of feature, growth, and product\-market fit expansion work.*
	    
	  â€¢   ***Product\-Market Fit Expansion \-*** *Increasing the ceiling on product\-market fit in a non\-incremental way by expanding into an adjacent market, adjacent product, or both.*
	    
	  
	  *One of the most common conflicts I've seen is when product leaders try to apply a single development process, measure of success, and strategy to all product work. For instance, while some of the steps can be similar, growth and feature work are fundamentally different and a lot of energy is wasted trying to make them all fit into the same process, success metric, and approach."* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h46mq4q149r5j1gdxwdfzpm5))
	- If you want to ship big innovative bets at scale, you cannot use the same execution system that teams use for more iterative work. You need to design a system and train the teams on how to use and when to use it. Teams should know which type of product problem they are working on, which tools/systems align to those problems, and where everyone is at in their respective processes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h46msqtc9k3v6v2thpwt4ncm))
	- Manage The Complexity, Don't Try To Remove It
	  
	  When creating and managing the system, the common tendency is try and ***remove*** complexity entirely. But this is impossible. There will always be a level of uncertainty involved in executing innovative and uncertain strategic ideas. Creating product\-changing wins involves taking higher\-risk, longer\-term bets. Instead, you need to ***accept the uncertainty*** by building processes that mitigate this complexity, increase conviction, and reduce risk over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h46mtbzf2mja3a04pfd6y16a))

	- **Agile Inspiration, Not Religion**
	  
	  The right system takes inspiration from two core agile principles but does not throw waterfall away in the process. Specifically, short timelines to workable prototypes and acceptance of new insights during development.
	  
	  Teams need to know how to get to workable prototypes in short time frames (weeks, not months). If you don't, this creates a negative flywheel where larger bets feel riskier and riskier due to longer windows of validation, and as a result, fewer bets are taken. You use the prototype to build conviction around the big bet, then step back and build a more structured plan.
	  
	  There also needs to be a deliberate focus on finding new insights during development and having a way to accept and incorporate these new learnings. Without this acceptance, teams take an "I'm just going to shut my eyes and hope for the best" approach. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h46mv22hvmhj3vz4w0v3f9yj))
	- **Having A Tolerance For Misfires**
	  
	  Sometimes the price of admission for being a company that's oriented around repeated big bets is you get slapped on the wrist, make a mistake, or have misfires. But that needs to be OK. Robinhood had a big misfire about a year ago with an innovative savings product. They eventually had to pause the delivery of that product until they resolved some of the regulatory questions and concerns. Robinhood eventually resolved those, and then six months later were able to bring the product to market and still knock it out of the park.

	- **Deliberate Tradeoff Decision Framework**
	  
	  You can't foresee everything at the beginning of the execution process. It is inevitable that something will come up that forces a tradeoff decision between delivery time, complexity or feature richness of the product, and quality of the experience. These are some of the hairiest conversations, and everyone needs to have a structured and deliberate approach to the decision. In a large scale effort they come up dozens of times and consistency in decision making leads to consistency in quality of the outcome. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h46n1gtb505dtw342wt9qheq))
	- **Codified Check Points With Specific Purposes**
	  
	  Part of having a defined system is to have codified checkpoints throughout the journey, each with their own specific purpose. A common method is to have "Product Reviews." But teams fall into two traps. One, using the same Product Review for all checkpoints in the process when you actually need different formats. Two, teams know that they should do Product Reviews, but have never been trained ***how*** to do them extremely well. Codified checkpoints help you hit the goldilocks test and are at the right layer of detail at the right points in the lifecycle of product development.

	- Communicating The System
	  
	  When implementing a system, the struggle begins with how it is communicated. This often manifests as execs saying "We need XYX process to make better products." The engineering and product teams then think, "Great, the execs just want to watch everything we do." It creates a feeling of distrust from the beginning.
	  
	  The "why" behind the process is what matters and should drive the narrative. I experienced this at Wealthfront:
	  
	  *"When I took over product at Wealthfront, I spoke with all of the PM/Design/Engineering leads and asked them what they hated about how we built products. From that feedback, I was able to create a list of the 5 most common ways in which the product process had been broken. I validated those 5 things with the leads. I then proposed we create more formal steps of a process to prevent us from making the same mistakes. Finally, I engaged the leads in creating the method so they felt bought into it." \- Andy Johns* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h46na782crjkns0xd10t88y0))
	- Know and Customize To Your Superpower
	  
	  The system that you design for innovative product delivery within your company needs to be tailored to your specific business, to the customer you're serving, and to the market that you're competing in because not all companies are the same.
	  
	  The great companies are those that understand that each step in the process is an atomic unit that they can mold and adapt to suit their exact needs. They eventually pick one part of the process that they turn into their "superpower." Common examples of this are Amazon's Press Release or Airbnb's 7 Star Review.
