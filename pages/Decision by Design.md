			- How to tackle Big Problems
				- Decisions are the choices we make to overcome existing problems, avoid future problems, or seize opportunities.
					- When working on difficult problems you're not motivated to work on, try to find or frame the problem for seizing opportunities or saving yourself from more problems in the future. #comment
					- Be humble, seek out feedback, donâ€™t assume you donâ€™t need it before you even have it.
					- Donâ€™t be afraid to ask stupid questions
				- While a lot of people fear and avoid decisions, by embracing them instead, and intentionally learning how to master them â€” we step out of a passive role in our lives and into an active one â€¦ we step into a leadership role.

				- Most people spend their time cleaning up, or suffering the consequences of poor decisions in work and life.
					- We end up wasting time and resources correcting poor decisions. We end up having no time to improve our decision making processes because we're too tied up reacting to the consequences of poor decisions.
					- What decision methods are we employing to ensure good decisions are being made? #comment

				- Good decisions on the other hand, builds good compounding benefits yielding more time, energy, and leverage future in future decisions.
				- When just one person takes the time to develop their decision making skillsâ€” it has long lasting impacts not just for that personâ€™s life but for the lives of others around them.

	- If a decision is consequential then look at [[downstream]] and [[upstream]] effects of the situation.
		- First [[ask]] if you are asking, solving, or pursuing the correct questions, problem, or opportunity
		- Assess the positive and negative feedback loops driving the situation
		- Think of [[Systems Thinking]]
		- [[Break]] down the [[consequential]] decision away to inconsequential and reversible decisions
	- Big, irreversible, and consequential decisions are usually dozens (if not hundreds or even thousands) of smaller decisions that combine to result in one big question, [[problem]], or [[opportunity]]
		- the more we can move decisions from the top right corner to the other quadrants -- and make decisions that are more reversible and less consequential the more we can get clarity, mitigate our risks, and keep ourselves in the best position to respond to the information we gather and change course.
		- Keep [[aware]] of the most important smaller decisions
		- By clearing up consequential smaller decisions, you'll have more space to deal with bigger decisions when they happen.
		- A reversible decisions doesn't imply they're easy to make. All [[[[consequential]] decisions]] are [[important]]
			- They take of a lot of [[resource]]s or have big [[impact]] on the [[future]]

	- You wan't to be a great at [[avoid]]ing or [[prevent]]ing problem, than a great problem solver
		- **Don't accept the problem as stated to you and start to act on it without first making sure it is the problem.**
			- Too often the first person to define the problem dictates the problem to be solved.
				- Our instinct once we see a problem is to jump on it and solve it right away without considering if the problem has been defined properly.
				- We waste too much time solving the wrong problems. We go too fast and don't spend enough time discovering the root of the problem.
		- If you think about what's happening in your life or work right now, large amounts of your time are being absorbed correcting initial mistakes. Most of these mistakes we don't want to admit to ourselves.
			- We're not investing enough time in our relationship.
			- We're not doing the extra work required to get the promotion. We're not focused on the things that matter.
			- We're not thinking about the long term.
			- We're not communicating clearly and effectively.
			- And as a result, we have all these problems.
		- But when you make better initial decisions, mistakes plummet, and you gain time and energy. All that free time can be used to invest in preparing yourself to make better decisions in the future, and you can see how this becomes a harmonious cycle.
		- The better your initial decision, the more free time you're going to have later, the less stress you're going to have, the less anxiety you're going to have, and the less time you're going to spend correcting mistakes for problems that could've been avoided.
	- Don't [[reward]] [[avoid]]able situations
		- When you [[reward]] heroic firefighting as an organization, that's what you tend to get.
		- When we reward people for solving problems that they should've avoided, we [[create]] a [[culture]] where it's much better to solve a problem because you have a good [[story]] around it than it is to actually avoid the problem in the first place. #[[high signal]]s activity
	- In creating automatic behaviors such as never let anybody define the problem for you and separate problem definition from solution, we create time for ourselves to think. This delay allows our more cognitive brains to take over our intuitive minds, resulting in better decision.
		- You can think of it as a structured approach to making time to think. When you never let anybody define the problem for you, you're delaying and you're giving yourself time to think. When you separate the problem from the solution, you're giving the group and everybody in the group time to think. To really understand something, you have to give your brain time to think and make connections so that you can see the big picture.
- Week #3 - When to Decide
	- The worst time to look for information is when you actually need it, because what happens is we ended up with the illusion of knowledge. Little information or easily accessible information can make it overconfident, we need to dig deeper and more detailed information and knowledge.
		- Making decisions on very little information or easily obtained is negative value. For value to be increased, we need to research more to make informed decisions
- Week #4 - Identifying the **Most Important Thing**
	- **Transcript:**__ Identifying the Most Important Thing__
	  One of the questions I get a lot is what is the most common problem with identifying the most important thing? And I think there's two you need to keep in mind here.^^The first is that you identify it, but fail to [[communicate]] it, and that causes a whole host of problems in the organization. You know what you want, but you failed to communicate it to other people. It's the same as not communicating it at all^^.
	  
	  **The second problem is that most people don't want to have to identify the most important thing because it means they might be wrong.** It takes away all the wiggle room, you have to actually hone in on what it is that you want and be clear about it. And when you do that, you have the ability to be wrong and most people don't want to be wrong. And so they shy away from identifying the most important thing or they use wording around the most important thing that's very generic or unspecific that gives them wiggle room just in case they're wrong. That way, they're always right.
