	 - Q: Creativity doesn't just involve imagination. It also involves motivation, organization, and collaboration.

	 - 3 Pillars of BASB
		 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FSbdfS6dNgD.png?alt=media&token=e3823f5f-f649-4f06-a74f-41c2fbed8592)

		 - Progressive Summarization

		 - PARA - Organization

		 - Just in time project management - Retrieval

	 - Module 2 - Organizing for Insight
		 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FpKEl_obni7.png?alt=media&token=3dde01aa-c1f5-445d-9e39-134764825116)

		 - Project:
			 - Goal to be achieved with an attached deadline

			 - A project without a goal is a [[hobby]]

			 - A goal without a project is a [[dream]]

		 - Area
			 - A standard has to be maintained with no end date

		 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2F3flGgk_gsh.png?alt=media&token=a2ec80c1-7d3d-4f55-9390-bce529bc1f28)

	 - Module 3
		 - Functions of note-taking tool #[[Note taking]]
			 - Promote unusual associations between pieces of information
				 - Increased sensitivity to unusual [[associations]] is an important contributor to [[creativity]]

			 - Create visual artifacts
				 - The basic mode of function for our brains is interacting with physical reality and not thinking #learning
					 - Watson and Crick used a [[physical model]] to discover the structure of DNA

					 - Visual artifacts allows us to interact with our notes

			 - Incubate ideas over time

			 - Provide raw material for unique interpretations and perspectives

	 - Module 4 - Progressive Summarization
		 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2Fl0cqc3QTpZ.png?alt=media&token=54429ef3-40d6-4f96-a50c-931dfa312665)

		 - **Not all notes need to go through all the five layers**

		 - Only start to densely connect notes once the information is relevant to a problem your solving #relationships #connections
			 - **Only densely connect your notes if you are trying to create new material**

	 - Module 5 - Maximizing [[Return on Attention]] 
		 - ^^As [[knowledge]] workers our [[return on investment]] is tied to our time and attention ^^

		 - ^^To create [[leverage]] we need to be aware on what we spend our [[time]] on and the return we get for that spent attention^^
			 - Try to get in the state of [[flow]]
				 - Flow (n.): a mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity

				 - Requirements for flow:
					 - clear goals

					 - immediate feedback

					 - challenge-skill ratio

				 - get rid of [[distractions]]

				 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2F7ufxKwQBxk.png?alt=media&token=de81d453-1c46-45cb-ba69-9daf7fc005a4)

				 - This approach is that all the value is at the end of the process and requires time investment and mental setup to get into flow

				 - **Create placeholders or modules and intermediate deliverables**
					 - to become [[interruption]] proof

					 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FDLNpUjxtK7.png?alt=media&token=080ed680-b0bb-4319-8416-44d21809e2f3)

				 - **Get feedback early and often**

				 - **Create value with any span of time**
					 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FDJU9OVdLac.png?alt=media&token=f211163f-cb5c-478b-bc38-dfc8e4532ae4)

				 - ^^Creating a process to deliver a [[modular]] projects and [[reusable]] deliverables can help optimize future projects and initiatives^^
					 - immediate feedback is allowed for modular and intermediate  placeholders and deliverables

					 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FSpH2MBGjfP.png?alt=media&token=e8059728-6a12-4d62-b1c0-c0218ed259f5)

			 - ^^[[interact]] with your information rather than [[consume]] it^^
				 - ^^The best [[return on attention]] when [[learning]] is to [[consume]] information that will help you [[construct]] something directly relevant to the information^^

				 - create [[intermediate]] placeholders in different forms when learning and consuming information

				 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FyAE6tworI-.png?alt=media&token=a4f388bc-9fbe-4845-a8fa-c52edb0d13cc)

	 - Module 6 
		 - [[Creation]] of deliverables
			 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2F-2ONWA0yjn.png?alt=media&token=10c6b949-6fea-43f9-a11b-7fd2bdfc4e0c)

			 - [[divergence]] gathering new information, new perspectives, we experiment and hypothesize on problems, concepts, and ideas
				 - **the divergence phase shouldn't be too tied to our goals and objectives because that drive for knowledge maybe killed. Instead we want our divergence phase be driven by our favorite problems that are long term, open-ended, and passion problem. **
