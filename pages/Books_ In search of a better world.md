- 1. Knowledge and the Shaping of Reality
	 - The central features of scientific knowledge are as follows:
		 - 1. It begins with problems, practical and theoretical

		 - 2. Knowledge consists in the search for truth—the search for objectively true, explanatory theories

		 - 3. Knowledge is not the search for certainty #[[feedback loops]] #[[Decision Making]]  #[[disconfirmation]]
			 - All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain.

			 - ^^Since we can never know anything for sure, it is simply not worth being certain, instead, it's better to search for truth, by searching for mistakes so that we can correct them. ^^

			 - There are uncertain truths—even true statements that we take to be false—but there are no uncertain certainties. 

- Reality
	 - [[materialism]] is characterized is by defining reality consisting of materials things that acted upon each other through pressure, push, or action by contact. There were two versions:
		 - [[atomism]] taught tiny particles interlink with each other and bump into each others. In between the particles there is a void
			 - The other taught that there was no void in between the atoms, that they existed within a full world, in "ether"

		 - Materialism made no allowances for unknown or unfamiliar modes of operation, only pressure, shove, and push. This belief was shaken with the introduction of force like gravity or repulsion through electromagnetism. This paved forward the replace of materialism with physicalism.

		 - [[competition]] can be interpreted through the lens of pessimism, limitation of freedom, or optimism. Competition exerts pressure from within to look for new possibilities and to realize these possibilities. The competition that exerts pressure from without can be seen pessimistically causing the elimination of weaker individuals and in the curtailment of freedom, even of the strongest.  #[[Growth Mindset]]

- On the Shaping of Reality
	 - It is important that we realize how little we know about the unforeseeable consequences of our actions (good or bad)

- 2. On knowledge and Ignorance 
	 - We should be knowledgeable through awareness of our ignorance, not about what we know. Exude intellectual modesty.

	 - Science is guesswork disciplined by rational criticism. 

- 3. On the source of our knowledge
	 - When people make assertions they should justify them. The source and therefore who they deem worthy to rule over truth, speaks of their motivations, biases, and thought processes. 
		 - Who do we deem as the best sources of our knowledge—the most reliable, those who will not lead us into error and we shouldn't there exist an infallible source of knowledge. We should also ask [[q: how can we detect errors in our knowledge?]] 
			 - ^^It's better to severely and objectively criticize the assertion than waste time and deferring our intelligence by questioning where the source of an assertion came from. Exercise your decision-making process and thought patterns. ^^** Origin and pedigree have very little to do with truth.** 
				 - 8 Theses of Sources Knowledge
					 - 1. There are no ultimate sources of knowledge. Every source, every suggestion is welcomed and open to critical examination. We should examine the asserted facts themselves, rather than investigate the sources of our information.

					 - 2. The proper questions of epistemology are not actually concerned with sources at all; rather, we ask whether an assertion is true—if it agrees with the facts.

					 - 3. In connection with critical examination of the truth, all kinds of arguments may be brought bear. One of the most important procedures is to take a critical attitude towards our own theories, to look for contradictions between our theories and observations.

					 - 4. Tradition, apart from inborn knowledge, is the most important source of our knowledge.

					 - 5. Without tradition, knowledge would be impossible.

					 - 6. Knowledge cannot start from nothing. New knowledge is built on modifications and corrections from earlier knowledge.

					 - 7. Neither observation nor reason is an authority. Other sources, such as intellectual intuition and intellectual imagination, are most important, but they are also unreliable. They may show us things with utmost clarity and yet mislead us. They are the main sources of our theories and are therefore indispensable, but the vast majority of our theories are false. The most important function of observation and logical thought, but also intellectual intuition and imagination, is to help us in the critical examination of those bold theories which we need in order to delve into the unknown. 

					 - 8. Clarity is an intellectual value in itself; exactness and precision, however, are not. Absolute precision is unattainable; and there is no point in trying to be more precise than our problem demands. The idea that we must define our concepts to make them 'precise' or even to give them meaning is misleading. Every definition must make use of defining concepts; and so we can never ultimately avoid working with undefined concepts. Problems connected with meaning or the definition of words are unimportant. They are purely verbal problems and are tire some. They should be avoided at all costs.

					 - 9. Every solution to a problem creates new unsolved problems. The harder the original problem and the bolder the attempt to solve it, the more interesting the new problems are. The more we learn about the world, and the deeper our learning, the more conscious, clear, and well-defined will be our knowledge of what we do not know, our knowledge of our ignorance. The main source of our ignorance lies in the fact that our knowledge can only be finite, but our ignorance must be necessarily finite.                                        

			 - However, don't seek perfection rather try to prove yourself wrong.  Examine other people's knowledge, but most importantly your own thinking. If we don't examine our own thinking, someone else will do it for us if we make them public. 

- 4. Science and Criticism
	 - > I think that what is common to art, myth, science and even pseudo-science is that they all belong to something like a creative phase which allows us to see things in a new light, and seeks to explain the everyday world by reference to hidden worlds...So science is characterized by rational criticism which is guided by the idea of truth, whereas imagination is common to all creative activity, be it art, myth, or science. 

	 - ^^The majority of creative ideas come through intuition; and those that do not are the result of critical refutation of intuitive ideas. ^^

- 5. The Logic of the Social Sciences
	 - __First thesis__ - We have plenty of knowledge that provides us with deep theoretical insight, and understanding of the world.

	 - __Second thesis__  Our ignorance is boundless. It is the continual expansion of our knowledge in the first thesis that reminds us of our ignorance.

	 - __Third thesis__ any theory on knowledge must acknowledge and address the relationship between our constantly increasing knowledge and the reality that we know nothing.

	 - __Fourth thesis - Knowledge starts from problems__ Knowledge doesn't start from perceptions or observations or collection of data

	 - __Fifth Thesis__ It is the character and the quality of the problem, and the boldness and originality of the solution, which determines the value, or lack of value, of the scientific achievement.
