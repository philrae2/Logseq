	- Reassurance seeking is a coping mechanism for avoiding uncertainty and the emotions that come with it.
	  
	  For example:
	  
	  •   After “bombing” a job interview, you immediately call your spouse looking for “support.” But in reality, you’re unwilling to sit with the uncertainty and fear around how the interview went and what will come of it.
	  •   You’re considering buying a home and find yourself compulsively calling your father or mother asking them for their “advice.” But in reality, you’re terrified of making a mistake and are using them to manage that fear.
	  
	  **Reassurance seeking means outsourcing the emotional labor of uncertainty management to other people.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmrkcysex0rvn77mc06t5k27))
	- And while it often brings relief in the short-term, the long-term consequences are increased anxiety, diminished confidence, and chronic self-doubt. Because when you constantly avoid managing your uncertainty, you communicate to your own mind that you can’t handle it, which creates a vicious self-fulfilling prophecy.

	- 2. Confront the emotions behind your impulse to seek reassurance
	  
	  Reassurance seeking is a behavior that’s motivated by strong emotions. More specifically, we’re motivated to seek reassurance because it gives us relief from an uncomfortable or painful emotion like fear or guilt.
	  
	  Many people justify their reassurance seeking behavior by claiming that they’re just asking for advice. But if you’re really sincere about the motivation behind your reassurance seeking, what you’ll usually find is that you’re not primarily motivated by the desire to learn and gain new information—what you really want is to feel less bad.

	- **Asking for advice is motivated by the desire to learn; reassurance seeking is motivated by the desire to feel better.**
	  
	  The problem is that if you’re constantly using other people to feel better, you’re teaching your mind that you can’t handle feeling bad, which only makes you feel more insecure and indecisive in the future.
	  
	  If you want to become more confident handling these difficult emotions behind your reassurance seeking, you have to look for them, confront them, and most importantly, be willing to have them instead of trying to avoid them or make them go away.
	  
	  A simple way to get started is to keep a *feelings file*—make a new notes file in your phone and, each time you find yourself reassurance seeking, write down A) the trigger, B) the reassurance seeking behavior, and C) what emotion is motivating that behavior.
	  
	  The more [awareness you bring to the emotions](https://nickwignall.com/4-tips-for-building-a-healthier-relationship-with-your-emotions/) behind reassurance seeking the less of a prisoner you will be to them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmrkghnhj83qa0qt1a95s4xp))
	- 3. Validate the desire for reassurance seeking
	  
	  Here’s the thing:
	  
	  **Seeking reassurance is a bad habit. But there’s nothing wrong with the desire for reassurance.**
	  
	  Nobody likes feeling anxious and indecisive. We all wish we knew the *right* thing to do. And everyone would prefer the comfort of reassurance to the pain of uncertainty.
	  
	  This is important to acknowledge because a lot of people who struggle with anxiety and reassurance seeking also tend to beat themselves up for it with lots of self-criticism and judgment, which only makes them feel worse and less confident.
	  
	  But you can counteract this habit by acknowledging your desire for reassurance and validating it, which is as simple as saying to yourself something like this:
	  
	  > Okay, I’m feeling really anxious about this decision. And even though I don’t like feeling anxious, it’s not bad. Most people would feel some anxiety in a situation like this. It’s okay to feel anxious and make the decision anyway.
	  
	  The better you are at [validating the emotion](https://nickwignall.com/how-to-validate-your-emotions/) behind your reassurance seeking, the easier it will be to resist the pull to act on that emotion. And the more you practice tolerating rather than acting on those emotions, the less intense they will become over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmrkh7e2jftas3d5pse3cp5n))
