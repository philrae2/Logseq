	- Tactic #1: Assign Tasks in an Email Using the “3Ws”   The “3Ws” (pronounced “three double\-yous”) stand for: Who, What, and When.   **Whenever you assign tasks in an email to someone, those 3Ws are mandatory.** If you miss out on any one of them, you’ll drastically increase the chance that you’ll miscommunicate on what needs to be done. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=204))
	- The Who The first W stands for the Who. This is basically the name of the person who you want to complete a task for you.   **When you’re assigning tasks in an email, you should start the ask using the name of a single person, not a group of people.** ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=210))
	- The second W stands for the What. This is a description of the exact task you need someone to do.   Don’t be ambiguous and avoid making any assumptions. The idea is to be very clear about what needs to get done. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=227))
	- **The third W stands for the When. This refers to the exact time and date a task needs to be completed by, which means a specific deadline that you are crystal clear on.   You should always use a deadline, even if it’s fake, because it gives your recipient both a clear goal and an incentive to get it done.** ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=233))
	- A perfect subject line is one that summarizes what the email is about. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=245))
	- **If the email includes actions you need someone (or a few people) to do, then as mentioned in tactic 1, add the Who, What, and When, but in an abbreviated way in the subject.   For example: “Chris \- need your report by tom COB.”   A good habit is to also type [ACTION] at the beginning of the subject line to stress importance.   For example: “[ACTION] John, reminder to send slides by Thu @ 5 p.m.”** ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=252))
	- **If the email is not an action\-oriented one (i.e., the 3Ws don’t apply), then add other prefix modifiers such as URGENT, CONFIDENTIAL, IMP (Important) or FYI (For Your Information) in the subject line to explain what the email is about.**([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=258))
	- subject line only if necessary When you’re replying to an email, avoid modifying the subject line unless you absolutely have to. That’s because it will make it harder to keep track of the conversation and search for any emails later on. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=273))
	- Second, if you’re removing recipients from an email reply due to confidentiality reasons, then it makes sense to add a prefix modifier to your subject such as “[Removing Vendor]” or “[Internal Only]” so that everyone is aware. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=285))
	- **Write Emails That are Five Sentences or Less** ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=292))
		- The sweet spot seems to be five sentences or less (there’s a whole website about it: http://five.sentenc.es), so that’s a good guideline to start with. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=302))
		- **Tip 1: Ask yourself, “What do I want?”** Most people don’t know what they want when they send an email; they just think that they do. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=308))
			- The reason for sending an email should be crystal clear, and you should ask yourself, “What do I really want the recipient to do or to know?” as a first step before writing a single word. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=314))
			- After clearly knowing what you want, get to the point as fast as possible right at the beginning of the email. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=317))
		- **Highlighting a lack of required action or response helps tremendously in clarifying expectations to your recipients. If you think your readers may ignore an email because no action is needed, then state it’s an IMPORTANT FYI.   For example, start your email by saying “Team \- this is an IMPORTANT FYI, so please read the note below, but no action is needed from your end at this time.”** ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=330))
		- To summarize, write short, five\-sentences\-or\-less emails that tell your reader exactly what you want and clearly state if you expect a response. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=335))
	- Tactic #4: Break Long Emails into Two Parts   Whenever you have the option, writing short, five\-sentences\-or\-less emails is always better than writing longer ones. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=337))
		- The best way to do so is to break down your email into two parts: a summary section and a detailed section. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=349))
		- Part 1: “Quick Summary” subheading Label the first part of your email with a “Quick Summary” subheading. (Side note: some folks call this summary the TL;DR version, which is counterintuitive based on the acronym definition, but it is commonly used in that fashion.)   This quick summary section should be five sentences or less, so the tips in the previous tactic apply here. It should summarize the main points of your long email and state all actions so that they’re not buried in your message.   If there are no actions needed, then state that in this section. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=352))
			- The way I think about writing this section is by asking myself, “Have I included all the information my readers absolutely must know if they don’t have time to read anything else?” ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=360))
			- Similarly, if you add a large attachment to the email, a good idea would be to highlight the main takeaways from the attachment in the summary. ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=363))
		- The second part of your email should be labeled “Details,” “Background,” or “Supporting Information.” ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=367))
			- The objective of this second section is to add more color or detail to your summary section. Also, if you had actions in the summary, then you could add more information about them here as well. ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=372))
	- Tactic #5: Make Your Emails Scannable ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=402))
		- Tip 1: Use bullet points for all your actions and questions ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=409))
		- When you use the 3Ws, every action should be on a separate bullet point for easier readability. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=412))
		- Show Instead of Tell by Attaching Screenshots ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=476))
		- “If…then…” statements are one of the absolute best ways to improve communication flow in your email messages.   Those little gems help in three ways.   First, they reduce the amount of follow\-up emails you have to write.   Second, they clarify expectations and assumptions so that there is absolutely no confusion about what could be meant by your recipient.   And third, they hold people accountable for getting back to you by a certain time or date. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=538))
		- Tip 2: Use “If…then…” to explain assumptions and set expectations “Daniel, your note wasn’t very clear to me. If you meant <A>, then I suggest we do <X>. Otherwise, if you meant <B>, then I suggest we do <Y>.” ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=552))
		- Tip 3: Use “If…then…” for accountability by your team members “Sarah \- Please let me know whether you want to make any more changes to the document. If I don’t hear back by Friday Jan 15 at noon Central Time, then I’ll assume you’re good with it and I will send it to the client at that time.” ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=559))
		- Tip 4: Use “If… then…” to have your team members remind you of something “I’ll ask around and get back to you. If you don’t hear back from me by Friday, then please send me a quick reminder early next week so I can follow up on that for you.” ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=568))
	- Tactic #9: Present Options Instead of Asking Open\-Ended Questions ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=577))
		- Email is a horrible medium for brainstorming and long\-form discussions. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=578))
		- The best way to ask an open\-ended question is to present your readers with options so that they give you a more directed answer.   For example, instead of asking “What do you guys think about this?” you can say “Do you think we should do A, B or C?” ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=585))
		- Re\-read your entire email before you click on the send button. Not a portion of it. Not just the actions. All of it. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=621))
		- Some of the things you want to double\-check include names, acronyms, time zones, and important dates. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=625))
		- If you’re replying to questions, re\-read the questions and your answers ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=627))
		- A good practice is to add context in your answers for validation, especially with important information.   For example, instead of replying with just an “Ok,” write “Ok, I’m confirmed to meet you on Thu at 10 a.m. Oct 20th.” This is not only reassuring, but it gives the other party an extra chance to correct something if they made a content error. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=630))
		- So by forcing yourself to add some clarification, you’ll make sure that your answers are not misconstrued. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=636))
	- Don’t use reply all when only the original sender needs to read your message. ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=732))
	- Send a follow\-up reply all email after any offline discussions ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=755))
	- State what you want your recipients to do A good practice is to explicitly state what you want your email recipients to do. ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=768))
	- Reply to Questions Inline ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=779))
	- Technically, the term “inline” means replying in the text of the original email that was sent to you (where you typically respond by saying “See my responses inline below”). Although this is sometimes ok, my preference is to copy the entire list of questions from the original email, paste them in your own email message, and then answer them. ([Location 794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=794))
	- If the questions were not separated out, then do that yourself If someone sends you an email with a bunch of questions that are all jumbled together in a paragraph, then separate the questions out for them. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=801))
	- When you receive an urgent or time\-sensitive email from a team member, it’s a good practice to reply immediately after you’ve read it. This acknowledges that you got their message, and helps calm them down and manage expectations. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=809))
	- Read the Latest Email on a Thread Before Responding ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018MGHZWO&location=840))
	- The first rule of an OOO reply is that you should set one up. It’s still surprising to me that people either ignore or forget about creating one, which leaves everyone hanging and unsure why you’re not responsive.   The second rule of an OOO reply is to write one that’s meaningful and contains everything your recipient needs to know while you’re away.
