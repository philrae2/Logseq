- Roles and Expectations
	- System Engineers are expected to be able to analyze systems requirements to determine if they can be tested, verified, and or validated and are unique, complete, unambiguous, consistent, and obtainable, and to trace all requirements to original business and mission needs.
	- They are expected to determine conformance to regulations and identify potential integration and interoperability challenges.
	- **Characteristics of Good Requirements**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Traceable
			- A requirement must be traceable to some source such as a system level requirement, which in turn needs to be traced back to an operational need be attributable to an authoritative source, whether a person or document.
			- Each requirement should have a unique identifier allowing the software design, code, and test procedures to be precisely traced back to the requirement.
		- Unambiguous
			- Consider that test wording of the requirement from different stakeholders' perspectives to see if it can be interpreted in multiple ways.
		- Specific and singular
			- Needed system attributes are described clearly as atomic, singular thoughts
		- Measurable
			- System functions can be assess quantitatively or qualitatively
		- Performance specified
			- Statements of real-world performance factors are associated with a requirement
		- Testable
			- All requirements must be testable to demonstrate that the end product satisfies the requirements.
		- Consistent
			- Requirements must be consistent with each other; no requirement should conflict with any other requirement. Check requirements by examining all requirements in relation to each other for consistency and compatibility.
		- Feasibility
			- It must be feasible to develop software that will fulfill each software requirement. If they aren't, they should be eliminated.
		- Uniquely Identified
			- Each need is stated exactly once to avoid confusion or duplicative work.
		- Design free
			- Requirements should be specified at the requirements level and not at the design level. Describe the requirement functionality from a requirement point of view, not from a design point of view (i.e., describe the functions that the system must satisfy). A requriement reflects "what" the system shall accomplish, while the design reflects "how" the requirement is implemented.
		- Uses "shall" and related words
			- In specifications, using "shall" indicates a binding provision (i.e., one that specification users must implement).  To state nonbinding provisions, use "should" or "may". Use "will" to express a declaration of purpose (e.g., "The government will furnish...") or to express tense.
	- Measurements Associated with Requirements Analysis
		- Measures off effectiveness (MOEs)
			- Measures mission success stated under specific environmental and operating conditions, from the users' viewpoint. (e.g., mission performance, safety, availability, and security)
		- Measures of performance
			- Measures specific physical or functional characteristics of the system's operation, measure under specified conditions.  They differ from MOEs in that they are used to determine if the system meets performance requirements necessary to satisfy the MOE.
		- Key Performance Parameters
			- KPPs are stakeholder-defined measure that indicates a minimal and critical system performance and level of acceptance
