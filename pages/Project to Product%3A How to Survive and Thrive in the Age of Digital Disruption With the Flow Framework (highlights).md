	- I realized their transformation plan was even more flawed in its approach than the one at Nokia. Every aspect of the transformation was being project managed to cost reduction alone and not to project overall business outcome with reduced cost as a key metric. As I learned more, I started getting a visceral image that a billion dollars of the world‚Äôs wealth was going to go up in flames without producing any value. There were still eighteen months left to right the ship, but I knew that with cost alone as the foundation of the transformation, it was too late to alter course.

	- Many digital transformations have gone wrong by over applying infrastructure concepts of the last revolution to this one. Production and assembly lines are great at reducing variability and reliably producing similar widgets, but software delivery is an inherently variable and creative endeavor that spans a complex network of people, processes, and tools. Unlike manufacturing, in modern software delivery the product development and design process are completely intertwined with the manufacturing process of software releases. Attempting to manage software delivery the way we manage production lines is another instance where frameworks from previous technological revolution are failing us in this one ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hate55xkg31t2va08bj18fd8))
	- What if we could see the flow of business value within our organizations in real time, all the way from strategic initiative to running software, the way the masters of the last age ensured they could see and collect telemetry for every step of the assembly line? Would we see a linear flow or a complex network of dependencies and feedback loops? As the data set of 308 enterprise IT toolchains we will examine in [Chapter 8](#I3QM0-02e15caf87a9436189b6d0daae3e8b94) demonstrates, we see the latter. This flow of business value within and across organizations is the Value Stream Network. In the Age of Software, Value Stream Networks are the new infrastructure for innovation. A connected Value Stream Network will allow you to measure, in real time, all software delivery investments and activities, and it will allow you to connect those flow metrics to business outcomes. It will empower your teams to do what they love doing, which is to deliver value for their particular specialty in the value stream. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hate684ccfc3999sax3cw8f0))
	- Software startups and digital natives have already created fully connected Value Stream Networks that are aligned to their product delivery, are focused on flow over siloed specialization, and connect all of their software delivery activities to measurable business results. Their leaders speak the language of developers, often because they were developers, which enables them to effectively direct their software strategies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hate8fy8y4qpqsdj94gnr0g6))
	- The vast majority of enterprise IT organizations have no formalized notion of value streams or measurement of how business value is delivered. Perhaps most shockingly, they do not even agree on what the units of production are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hateh20t6pygw8zxqyd7q65k))
	- The problem is that, aside from a handful of exceptions, such as the tech giants, the vast majority of organizations have not yet learned how to effectively scale software delivery systems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hatejesx2cz6rsnar3b9qa4h))

	- the problem is that those transformations are failing. The main reasons for failure, according to Altimeter‚Äôs report ‚ÄúThe 2017 State of Digital Transformation,‚Äù are a shortage of digital talent and expertise (31.4%), general culture issues (31%), and the treatment of digital transformation as a cost center instead of an investment (31%).[5](#ch1_fn5) None of these are root causes of transformation failure; rather, they are symptoms of a fundamental disconnect between business leaders and technologists that we will review throughout this book. This is not to say that talent is not critical; it is. But a project-oriented approach creates the conditions that push talent out of the organization instead of attracting talent to it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hatetxdbx6wtt1nakehn8p90))
	- The bottom line is that even with the best strategies and intentions, software delivery capacity and capabilities are a bottleneck in the digital transformation. Too little happens too slowly, and the business side does not understand why or what to do about it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hatevtkm1hsxsz65a1255fty))

	- A fundamental shift is happening. Even when staffed with tens of thousands of workers, the incumbents create and deliver software at a rate that appears to be leaving large and numerous doors open to disruption. And it‚Äôs not for lack of discussion or investment to stay ahead of the startups or lack of finding creative ways to play offense or defense to the disruptors. Thanks to their ability to build and iterate on software quickly, and because they are unencumbered by existing customers or legacy systems, startups are innovating how customers interact with their products in services ranging from health insurance to cryptocurrencies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb011w47zv8j48e2s6wdscdg))
	- In this age, survival is dependent on an organization‚Äôs ability to deliver software products and digital experience. Underscoring the scale and urgency, IDC, a market research firm, has estimated digital transformation as an $18.5 trillion opportunity by 2020, which represents 25% of the global GDP.[1](#ch2_fn1) Those that succeed will reap the rewards and displace those that do not. Many large organizations have already kicked off their transformation initiatives; others are noticing their software investment creeping up on them, with CFOs often the first to realize how much of next year‚Äôs budget and headcount is related to IT. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb01cyq3gvnfwsv3dtmktt8k))
		- **Note**: Is generative AI the next set of transformation business drivers?
	- Finally, while the developers were positive on Scrum overall, their daily work was disconnected from the higher-level planning that was being done with a whole different set of tools. The enterprise-level Agile tool that was selected was not being used by the developers, who preferred simpler developer-centric tools. Instead, they would document the work completed for the release at the end of the iteration (or ‚Äúsprint‚Äù), after the work was done, as user stories (a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective). The tool, which had all the features of a modern best-of-breed Agile tool, effectively became a documentation tool, not the mechanism for flow and feedback that had been intended. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0216p242tkwf6h1brdjeff))
		- **Note**: Is the organization following agile or are there parts where agile in name only?
	- In every way that it was being measured, the transformation was on track‚Äîall of the right activities were happening, right down to the adoption of the Agile tool. But the developers were suffering from major friction, both in what it took to build code and in what it took to deploy it. Even more consequential was how difficult adding features had become due to the size and architecture of the Symbian OS.
	  
	  If the transformation had been measured according to outcomes or results instead of activities, the picture would have looked much different. The fundamental bottlenecks that the developers were encountering would have surfaced. The investment needed in Nokia‚Äôs core platform, the Symbian OS, could have been made in a way that would allow it to compete with new, software-savvy entrants to the market, like Apple. But that crucial feedback was not making it back to the business because of the way development was disconnected from the business. And the downstream disconnects and inefficiencies in building and deploying the software meant that any progress in improving this would run at too slow a pace. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb023mb20gwb0btyx6nt99j2))
		- **Note**: Even if agile activities are occurring-we also need to measure the speed and quality of outcomes. Agile requires quick turn around and feedback.
	- At a business level and as a market leader, Nokia was well aware that it needed to move and adjust quickly in the rapidly evolving mobile ecosystem. This was the reason to roll out Agile in the first place: to more quickly adapt to that marketplace and the growing role of software within it. Though the proxy metrics could deem the Nokia Agile transformation a success, the lack of actual business results of that transformation contributed to the business‚Äô failure and inability to shift from elegant handsets and buttons to a software and screen-centric mobile experience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb026kj4yjrbn1p7sypcxkt6))
	- Nokia had an engine and infrastructure for innovating on the hardware front that was a pinnacle of the Age of Mass Production, but they did not have an effective engine and infrastructure for the Age of Software and did not have the management metrics or practices in place to realize that until it was too late. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb027ezdf962pyz5ryqhdxhe))
	- If we step back and imagine Nokia‚Äôs end-to-end value stream, the Agile transformation was a local optimization of the value stream. In other words, while a tremendous amount of investment went into the transformation, the bottleneck to delivering an operating system capable of supporting a mobile ecosystem was not the Agile teams.
	  
	  Was it downstream of the Agile teams, in a lack of continuous integration and delivery capability? Was it in the architecture itself, which could not support the kinds of feature and product delivery that were needed? Or was it upstream of development and closer to the business, which was so disconnected from delivery and the architectural investment needed, such as technical debt reduction, that they did not realize Agile planning would fail to drive any of the desired results? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb028fh5rrnzba33ph1j0m1p))
	- Lesson One: To avoid the pitfalls of local optimization, focus on the end-to-end value stream.
	  
	  In the context of a software value stream, the concept of ‚Äúend-to-end‚Äù includes the entire process of value delivery to the customer. It encompasses functions ranging from business strategy and ideation all the way to instrumentation of usage to determine which values were most adopted by the customer base. It is this end-to-end process that we need to understand and find bottlenecks in before considering the optimization of any particular segment of the process, such as feature design or deployment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb02a6fsszjgdrczw6kmhdys))
	- Contrast the approach that Nokia took with the BMW Group story earlier in this chapter. The entire Leipzig plant is designed to make the value stream visible, and the buildings are architected around the bottleneck. The architecture of the buildings is extensible to support the evolution of production technologies and changes in market conditions. Nokia had this level of maturity for its devices, but in spite of mastering mass production, it was not able to make the pivot into applying these lessons to software delivery. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb02b3kkbvvm318jk9sfbfpy))
	- Eliyahu M. Goldratt‚Äôs theory of constraints and its applicability to Agile software development are discussed in xyKent Beck‚Äôs book Extreme Programming Explained.[6](#ch2_fn6) Goldratt famously explained how investments made in areas other than the bottleneck are futile.[7](#ch2_fn7) This was the futility of Nokia‚Äôs Agile transformation. Nokia could have had the most supportive leadership and culture on the planet, transformed twice as fast, achieved twice the agility, and invested twice as much into the Agile transformation and still have seen no change in the slope of their decline due to the fact that the effort was not being applied at the bottleneck. What‚Äôs worse, the outcomes of the effort were not being measured. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb02c9mn9ftp8vn232rcgrw4))
		- **Note**: Identify the bottlenecks in the process to be a truly agile organization.
	- Could adoption of DevOps practices such as continuous delivery have turned the tide at Nokia? Possibly. Some of these practices were already in place, like automated testing. In my interviews, the subjects reported major inefficiencies that would have been addressed by the other key practices summarized in The DevOps Handbook‚Äîthe automation of the entire deployment pipeline and support for small batch sizes.[8](#ch2_fn8) In my experience, those practices are critical to an effective value stream, and if they are not adopted, it is only a matter of time before they become the bottleneck. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb02etq4xnrknw0djf4yhg0h))
	- Had Nokia adopted the Three Ways of DevOps ([Figure 2.2](#fig2-2)), they would have at least started on the path to identifying the bottleneck. By focusing on ‚Äúflow‚Äù and ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù from Dev to Ops, Nokia might have seen indications of very long lead times for deployment. And ‚Äúcontinual learning,‚Äù if elevated beyond just development leaders, might have caused company leadership to start asking the right questions about organizational structure or the software architecture.

	  Figure 2.2 : The Three Ways of DevOps ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb02fq6872cq8dzmc9gm5t31))
	- Or not. Nokia could have taken a very tactical approach to DevOps transformation, focused on continuous integration and application release automation alone, and not noticed the architectural or organizational bottlenecks. At a managerial level, they were missing the infrastructure and visibility that would allow them to see what was going on in their value stream. If treated like they treated Agile, DevOps would have been relegated to a technical practice rather than being elevated to the business, and would not have altered the outcome. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb02ga5mgsbshdqnkwcgbcry))
	- At LargeBank, IT is run as a cost center under the CFO. The business outcome that was being measured and managed was how much cost could be cut as a result of the transformation. At the outset, I did not see this as a fundamental problem, as so many of the organizations I work with are in a similar situation. However, after interviewing people involved with the transformation and hearing them discuss it, many of the unintended consequences appeared to point back to this as the source of the problem. For example, managing the cost alone meant that IT could run the transformation without closely involving the business stakeholders. If the goal is cost, who knows better than IT how to reduce infrastructure spending, staff costs, and other overheads? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1c2vwafc9rhnfgayy8h4kg))
		- **Note**: When transforming the organization to digital, don't solely take on an cost cutting frame.
	- On the business side, there were digital initiatives underway in parallel, with goals to design and create new digital experiences for mobile and web. However, these were divorced from the IT transformation‚Äîakin to building a great dashboard for a car without having a car or even a line of sight to a car that could support all of those fantastic new features. For example, other than proving a proof of concept in one part of the application portfolio for just one country or region. Due to this compartmentalization, it was impossible to know whether these mobile experiences could ever run on every type of system that the bank had across the globe. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1c4r9g7vvwc948rdn18vcx))
	- Lesson Two: If you manage a transformation according to cost alone, you will reduce productivity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1dwxmrd264f46jg0s05q1z))
	- LargeBank‚Äôs billion-dollar transformation project was functionally composed of countless subprojects, all of which were running to this two-year time frame. By virtue of being managed as projects, their goal was to be on time, on budget, and to deliver the business goal of cost reduction at the finish line. If every puzzle piece of this massive project fit perfectly with every other, and all were delivered on time and on budget, would that mean success? From an activity and project-oriented view, the answer is yes. But what about the business results? How were those measured at each step? How were bottlenecks identified across the tens of thousands of people, hundreds of processes, and dozens of tools? The bottom line is that they weren‚Äôt. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1ck7075hfypjcdrdxm7njf))
	- Here, we find the root of the disconnect. When IT is treated as a cost center, the transformation takes on the same mentality. The focus becomes the successful reduction of cost at the end of the project time frame. Yet at the executive level, the very business case for the transformation would have touted the benefits of Agile and DevOps, such as faster time to market, more competitive product offerings, and more efficient delivery. However, those outcomes are not what gets measured by an organization that manages according to cost alone. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1cw73h4fxcmtmmcgex3h60))
	- While it‚Äôs true that cost reduction can be a critical component of a transformation, that‚Äôs not the issue. The issue is that a cost-centric framework did not deliver increased velocity, productivity, or efficiency, and instead resulted in the business getting a lot less for less instead of more for less. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1cvvzmyndk6nydr0h0362j))
	- The problem is not the use of proxy metrics themselves; the problem is that we are relying on proxy metrics for decision making rather than finding the metrics that directly correspond to business outcomes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1d0y0v3p65a7njmm1m2m5e))
	- Resist Proxies
	  
	  As companies get larger and more complex, there‚Äôs a tendency to manage to proxies. This comes in many shapes and sizes, and it‚Äôs dangerous, subtle, and very Day 2.
	  
	  A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you‚Äôre not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you‚Äôre doing the process right ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1d1ngkjsybpz4hg75qqz95))
	- In other parts of our business, we have outcome-based metrics, like revenue, daily active users, and Net Promoter Scores (NPS). The problem is that organizations do not have an agreed-upon set of metrics for measuring and tracking work in IT, and as such, settle for these proxies. And the wrong set of metrics is coming from measuring not the flow of value delivered but the ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù execution of IT projects. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1d2cbhsjwyfprazzertnhn))
	- During a visit to Boeing, I remember learning that they design planes for approximately three decades of active production followed by another three decades of maintenance.[16](#ch2_fn16) In other words, they are thinking ahead six decades in terms of support costs for both the hardware and the software. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1dtkbstngckw6ezw817516))
	- Lesson Three: Engineering/IT and the business must be connected. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1dwbvg3v0yprq2e8j0jn0m))
	- Tracking software delivery to business outcomes and treating it as a profit center is one of the main reasons why tech companies are faring so much better than their enterprise IT counterparts, who are stuck in what Mary Poppendieck calls the ‚Äúcost center trap.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1dxv26fzhah2azvsx1j570))
	- Is this cost center approach endemic to large enterprise organizations? Consider how a large and very cost-conscious company like Boeing is managing the production of its Dreamliner. Costs are, of course, a key factor. But the success of Boeing depends not only on cost reduction but on the adoption and profitability of each plane for the span of its life cycle in the market‚Äîthis is why Boeing innately takes a long view on the traceability of its software. Boeing knows that life cycle profitability will be affected if the software cannot be economically maintained, or if current or future regulation changes cannot be easily addressed in the software. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1dypvj03yq78edptn3jehn))
	- The market adoption and profitability of the BMW Group‚Äôs electric cars would be hard to determine in a changing market, so the BMW Group created a production architecture to support learning from the market before investing further in automation of the lines. The profitability and product/market fit drove the architecture of the value stream, not vice versa. Again, it was a complete one-eighty from the approach at LargeBank, where IT was transforming for IT‚Äôs sake. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1f7tft9zsnkfxghws09gbh))
	- In Zone to Win, Moore provides a model with four distinct investment zones ([Figure 2.3](#fig2-3)).[24](#ch2_fn24) The Productivity Zone is focused on making the bottom line and includes systems such as HR and marketing. The Performance Zone is about the top line and includes the main drivers of revenue. The Incubation Zone is where new products and businesses are developed before just one or the other is moved into the Transformation Zone and used to play disruption offence or defense. In defining a value metric for different product lines, the zone and its goals must be identified. For example, in the Incubation Zone, the business objective might be monthly active users, before transitioning to a Transformation Zone where the focus is more on revenue than on profit ([Figure 2.3](#fig2-3)).

	  Figure 2.3: Zone Management[25](#ch2_fn25)
	  
	  The mistakes many organizations are making in their digital transformations are in using the metrics from the Productivity Zone‚Äîcosts and the bottom line‚Äîfor measuring their entire IT and software delivery capabilities. Prior to the Age of Software, all of IT could be relegated to the Productivity Zone; but the whole purpose of a digital transformation is to allow the organization to launch and manage products in the other zones, which is what will determine their future relevance in the market. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1fabgyacz3ek03ytf8fskt))
	- Software delivery is, by its nature, creative work. Software specialists are skilled at automating repetitive processes when given the chance, leaving only the complex work and decision making that humans continue to excel at. Applying management frameworks from a hundred years ago to organizations that need to compete on digital assets is futile. To make this more concrete, [Table 2.1](#tab2-1) contrasts a project-oriented approach with a product-oriented one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1fn4hfpmaw1c5k62225zs2))
	- Project-Oriented Management
	  
	  Product-Oriented Management
	  
	  Budgeting
	  
	  Funding of milestones, pre-defined at project scoping. New budget requires creation of a new project.
	  
	  Funding of product value streams based on business results. New budget allocation based on demand. Incentive to deliver incremental results.
	  
	  Time Frames
	  
	  Term of the project (e.g., one year). Defined end date. Not focused on the maintenance/health after the project ends.
	  
	  Life cycle of the product (multiple years), includes ongoing health/maintenance activities through end of life.
	  
	  Success
	  
	  Cost center approach. Measured to being on time and on budget. Capitalization of development results in large projects. Business incentivised to ask for everything they might need up front.
	  
	  Profit center approach. Measured in business objectives and outcomes met (e.g., revenue). Focus on incremental value delivery and regular checkpoint.
	  
	  Risk
	  
	  Delivery risks, such as product/market fit, is maximized by forcing all learning, specification, and strategic decision making to occur up front.
	  
	  Risk is spread across the time frame and iterations of the project. This creates option value, such as terminating the project if delivery assumptions were incorrect or pivoting if strategic opportunities arise.
	  
	  Teams
	  
	  Bring people to the work: allocated up front, people often span multiple projects, frequent churn and re-assignment.
	  
	  Bring work to the people: stable, incrementally adjusted, cross-functional teams assigned to one value stream.
	  
	  Prioritization
	  
	  PPM and project plan driven. Focus on requirements delivery. Projects drive waterfall orientation.
	  
	  Roadmap and hypothesis testing driven. Focus on feature and business value delivery. Products drive Agile orientation.
	  
	  Visibility
	  
	  IT is a black box. PMOs create complex mapping and obscurity.
	  
	  Direct mapping to business outcomes, enabling transparency.
	  
	  Table 2.1: Project-Oriented Management vs. Product-Oriented Management ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1fnt2t84degqwq958q62e1))
	- This is where the mismatch becomes immediately apparent. DevOps and Agile are all about creating a feedback loop to address the inherent uncertainty of software delivery and then providing the feedback loop to the business to adjust accordingly. The more certainty there is, the more optimal a long-term allocation of resources gets created by a project plan. However, due to the degree of complexity in software delivery and the inherent rate of change in the market due to the Turning Point, baking all that uncertainty into project plans not only creates tremendous waste but gives the business visibility into the wrong things, providing a view into activities and proxy metrics over visibility into the incremental delivery of business results. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1frk6pbqk6qqzhc53qhjqx))
	- In an Incubation or Transformation Zone initiative, there could be more uncertainty than certainty. This results in project plans that incentivize delaying releases and customer testing in order to implement everything that was needed at the start of the project. And this multiplies the product/market-fit (PMF) risk by removing the possibility of iterative learning from the market and pivoting accordingly.
	  
	  In contrast, product-oriented management focuses on measuring the results of each unit of investment that brings value to the business. Those units are products; they deliver value to a customer, and as such, the measurement must be based on those business outcomes. Funding of new value streams is based on a business case for that product, as is ongoing investment in those value streams. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1fzwc01w2qxcbevxzk6f8a))
	- One of the biggest problems that project-oriented management faces stems from the consideration of time frames. A project has a defined time frame after which resources ramp down. This makes perfect sense when building a skyscraper, as there is a definitive and well-understood end to the project: after the skyscraper is erected, the project moves into a maintenance period. However, products, be they software or hardware, have a life cycle, not a definitive end. Products can be end-of-lifed; for example, Google has killed dozens of products, including Google Reader and Google Wave. As long as a product is available, defect fixes and new features are requested, as the ecosystem around software products is constantly evolving. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1g20hrn853aa1hz73cb9d7))
	- Applying the project-oriented mentality of creating then launching a software product, and then assuming it can be reduced to a fraction of its investment when in maintenance mode, has many unintended consequences. For example, one enterprise organization that I worked with did a survey to assess the state of project management across thousands of IT staff. They found that the number of projects that an engineer was assigned to over the course of a year ranged from six to twelve on average, depending on where they worked in the organization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1g2876b66n0ph9m9jhpfpr))
	- Some organizations address the post-project maintenance of software by outsourcing it to organizations such as the global systems integrator (GSI). This additionally reduces the apparent cost of maintaining the software, potentially removing it as a liability on the balance sheet. This outsourcing appears to work in theory, but it can cripple flow and feedback loops, as organizational boundaries need to be crossed. In addition, it further disconnects that software from the business. If the software was core to the business, this is debilitating in terms of continuing to deliver business results, as the need for change and updates is constant in software. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1g3kdn9a5rrsspfd2nc04v))
	- It gets worse. With this ‚Äúproject-end fallacy,‚Äù key aspects of the economics of software delivery are not visible to the organization. For example, one of the core concepts that we will review in the next chapter is technical debt. The accumulation of technical debt that results from normal software development creates problems that are well documented. And if this debt is not reduced regularly, the software becomes prohibitively difficult and expensive to add features to or to fix. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1nfv6myn5g8bhkftw7tdyy))
	- At a leadership level, the success metrics that we place on our organizations and on our teams will determine behavior. Project-oriented management tends to take a cost center approach, which is still common for enterprise IT. As we witnessed with the story of LargeBank, expecting an increase in the delivery of business value from a cost center is pointless ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1ngp23bqjz2yr3qnj9s609))
	- Project-oriented management is designed to identify and create contingencies for all risks that could be incurred during the project. However, that requires up-front knowledge of all the risks, which works in some domains but not in the highly uncertain and changing world of software delivery ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1nk7c6ve5q3sk9vphzfx43))
	- Overlaid on top of the costs to the individual IT specialist‚Äôs productivity and happiness are the costs to the team. Teams working on complex problems go through what psychologist Bruce Tuckman coined the forming, storming, norming, and performing life cycle.[29](#ch2_fn29) Reallocating people disrupts that cycle; the more people are moved, the higher the productivity cost for the team.

	- The project-oriented management approach of ‚Äúbringing people to work‚Äù is not suited for complex knowledge work, like software delivery. High-performing software organizations have already learned that ‚Äúbringing work to people‚Äù is more effective. Long-lived teams allow for expertise (both individual and team) and relationships to build over time, improving both velocity and morale. This enables other benefits as well, such as problems being solved at the lowest level of the organization instead of having the nonscalable, constant escalations to management that result from changes to plan.

	- In project-oriented management, the project plan drives priorities. Changes to the plan are expensive in terms of management overhead, communication, and coordination; and as such, adjustments to the plan tend to be minimized. In software delivery terms, this tends to drive a ‚Äúwaterfall‚Äù software delivery model, as that is the model that naturally aligns to a cascading project plan. While this is suitable to projects with a high degree of predictability, it is counterproductive for software delivery. Product-oriented management sets priorities based on product road maps of features and constant hypothesis testing. At an organizational level, this means applying the feedback and continual learning principles of DevOps at all levels of the organization, right up to senior management.

	- The goal of the Flow Framework is to provide the missing layer between business-driven digital transformations and the technical transformations that underpin them. If the digital transformation is focused on processes and activities instead of business results, it is unlikely to succeed; and the business is unlikely to realize that until it is too late. The concepts of organizational charts and Scrum teams will continue to be as relevant as ever. But for an organization wanting to become a software innovator, these are secondary to product-oriented value streams. The Flow Framework ensures that your transformation is grounded in connecting, measuring, and managing your Value Stream Network, which is the critical layer needed to succeed with software delivery at scale. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1q7sz589qc4tq1m3sgw5jt))
	- For example, at LargeBank, the delivery efforts were not structured into products supported by value streams, so there was no clear or consistent way of identifying the customer for each part of the project portfolio. For many internal applications and components, the customer was not specified; and in many cases, delivery was more closely aligned to legacy software architecture than to internal or external customer pull. Extracting the value streams from project-oriented management was impossible due to all of the overlap between the projects and a lack of alignment between the projects and the software architecture. And due to all the disparate systems and focus on local optimization and tracking of activities instead of results, it was impossible for anyone to reliably know where the bottleneck was ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1r4bvxm9mv5r4dcked3npq))
	- The Flow Framework provides a simple path to answering these questions. There are key staff within your organization who already know the answers, but their efforts and vision need to be connected to an organizational strategy and approach. Most important, it provides you with a way of connecting your Value Stream Network, measuring the flow of business value and correlating that to your strategy and business outcomes. The Flow Framework will allow you to:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   See the end-to-end flow of business value in real time
	  ‚Ä¢   Instantly spot bottlenecks and use them to prioritize investment
	  ‚Ä¢   Test hypotheses based on real-time data from every value stream
	  ‚Ä¢   Rearchitect your organization around maximizing flow ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1r56500nc2zvx53m668q7h))
	- The Flow Framework provides a system for the end-to-end measurement of the results of software delivery. The focus is on the measurement of the ground truth of software delivery‚Äîthe actual work being done‚Äîand connecting the work to results, such as revenue generation. The focus is entirely on result-oriented business metrics, like revenue and cost, not proxy metrics for value creation, like lines of code created or deploys per day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1r7btf2x1chf80nt3q3yhq))
	- This is not to say that proxy metrics of that sort are not important. For example, if lack of continuous delivery automation is the bottleneck for a value stream, then measuring deploys per day becomes a critical metric. However, the Flow Framework is focused on the end-to-end metrics used to identify bottlenecks wherever they lie in the value stream. In addition, the Flow Framework avoids measures of activity in favor of results. There are no metrics of ‚Äúhow Agile‚Äù a team or organization is; there‚Äôs just a focus on how much business value flows. If Agile development is a bottleneck, then measuring a proxy such as the number of people trained on Scrum can result in an increase to the flow of business value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1r82hnpg38bxjxby3rb0xw))
	- While the Flow Framework does not require the implementation of a specific Agile framework or working model, nor any specific approach to DevOps or customer success, it does require a commitment to the Lean concepts that are the foundation of those approaches. At the highest level, the purpose of the Flow Framework is to provide an actionable way of implementing the concepts of Lean thinking for large-scale software delivery. Those concepts are defined by James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones in their Lean Thinking book as follows:
	  
	  ...lean thinking can be summarized in five principles: precisely specify value by specific product, identify the value stream for each product, make value flow without interruptions, let the customer pull value from the producer, and pursue perfection.[2](private://read/01h9v9x5kct1xhzfvvrrgnf9fm#ch3_fn2) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1rhd3gxjvk0bd66wg23gfj))
	- Such practices and frameworks are as relevant as ever, and the Flow Framework assumes that the best-suited practices for your business are already underway. The role of the Flow Framework is to ensure that the business-level frameworks and transformation initiatives are connected to the technical ones. It is the isolation of these initiatives that is causing so many transformations to stall or to fail. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1qc7xnczfv93k5adap907q))
	- o achieve the Three Ways of DevOps‚Äîflow, feedback, and continuous learning‚Äîwe need to scale the ways of DevOps beyond IT to the business. We need a new framework to plan, monitor, and ensure the success of today‚Äôs software-centric digital transformations. This new framework cannot be separate from the business; it must be connected directly to the measurement of business objectives and key results. It also cannot ignore the idiosyncrasies of software development or assume that software can be managed like manufacturing. And it cannot be overly focused on one aspect of software delivery, be that development, operations, or customer success. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1qcvhxx6k2mes6gmsexhj9))
	- What Is a Value Stream?
	  
	  One of the first principles in Lean thinking is to ‚Äúidentify the value stream for each product.‚Äù[3](private://read/01h9v9x5kct1xhzfvvrrgnf9fm#ch3_fn3) We will go into detail on how we do that in [Chapter 9](private://read/01h9v9x5kct1xhzfvvrrgnf9fm#J2B80-02e15caf87a9436189b6d0daae3e8b94); for now, consider it to include every person, process, activity, and tool related to delivering that software product. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1rvh8b8ymadb3ja9yz3ntw))
	- Value Stream: The end-to-end set of activities performed to deliver value to a customer through a product or service ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1rw3754c04vzgtgfg5cs6b))
	- At the Leipzig plant, all staff know who the customer is. All staff can see the activity of the company‚Äôs value streams along the production lines. All staff know what business the customer pulls from those value streams: cars that deliver on BMW‚Äôs mantra of ‚ÄúSheer Driving Pleasure.‚Äù And all staff know what the plant‚Äôs bottleneck is. Contrast that to today‚Äôs enterprise IT organizations, where not just the staff but the leadership have problems answering the questions most fundamental to production:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   Who is the customer?
	  ‚Ä¢   What value is the customer pulling?
	  ‚Ä¢   What are the value streams?
	  ‚Ä¢   Where is the bottleneck? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1qf7kdarxb6w56pqww2kst))
	- Each product needs to be well defined as a packaging of software features that a customer uses, either directly or embedded as part of another physical or digital offering. That means the customer needs to be well defined too, but the customer need not be defined strictly as an external user. For example, an internal business user of a billing system is also a customer, meaning that the billing system can and should have its own value stream. Some organizations may have a team that produces an internal platform or API (application programming interface) that is only consumed by other developers within the organization. In that case, the customers are the consumers of that API. Each product has a customer who consumes the software produced by that product‚Äôs value stream. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1rx0b8y27m48tjr5hranwd))
	- Value streams are composed of all the activities, stakeholders, processes, and tools required to deliver business value to the customer. While this may sound obvious, my second epiphany was all about the fact that instead of creating abstractions around end-to-end value streams, organizations keep creating them within functional silos. For instance, if support teams or business stakeholders are excluded from the process, the result is no longer a value stream but a segment of the value stream. As such, Agile teams are segments of the value stream, as are DevOps teams. Even cross-functional feature teams rarely constitute the full value stream at a large organization. For example, as they tend to exclude the support team ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1rxr8h6c63h59dk7amca0j))
	- The Flow Framework focuses entirely on the end-to-end value stream flow and its correlation to business results ([Figure 3.2](private://read/01h9v9x5kct1xhzfvvrrgnf9fm#fig3-2)). The measurement is done via the ground truth of software delivery that is observed by the flow of artifacts through the Value Stream Network (as detailed in Part III). Agile and DevOps metrics and telemetry lie a layer down below the Flow Framework. For example, if an Agile team is constantly struggling with meeting its release goals, the SAFe or Scrum frameworks can provide metrics and guidelines for better prioritization and planning. In contrast, the Flow Framework is focused on the end-to-end metrics used to identify where those bottlenecks might lie in the first place‚Äîif they are upstream or downstream of development, for instance.

	  Figure 3.2: The Flow Framework ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1s0bdqy8rjztkv5cfqaw1r))
	- At the top level, the Flow Framework provides two things. First, the Value Stream Metrics allow you to track each value stream within the organization so that you have a way of correlating production metrics to business outcomes. Second, the Value Stream Network layer provides the infrastructure needed to measure the results delivered by each product.
	  
	  At the highest level, the Flow Framework is a mechanism for aligning all delivery activities in your organization around your software products, tracking the business results of those activities in order to create a results-driven feedback loop ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1s1pmc27j0ysmdcg898cqe))
	- To do that, we must switch to first principles and define the customer, what they are pulling, and how this pull can be implemented as value stream flow. Once one or more value streams are defined, we need to focus on making value(s) flow smoothly across those value streams. But before we do that, we must define the units that flow along a software value stream ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1s2ghrmj2nvkjvgp7g0wyw))
	- Every time that I have asked a senior- or executive-level IT leader where their bottleneck is, I have received either a blank stare or a vague answer. But when set in the right context, just the thought process of exploring this question makes a serious issue apparent. The vast majority of enterprise IT organizations do not have a well-defined productivity measure for what flows in their software production process ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1s3qdw2jjr9tvzrs8zkmr8))
	- There is no clear consensus from academia or from industry thought leaders on what constitutes software development productivity. Organizations know it when they see it‚Äîperhaps through products that drive market adoption and revenue faster than others. But correlating development activities to those results has been more of an opaque art than a disciplined activity. To define productivity in a value stream, we must first define what flows. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1s4ywjq2rvrwhxphxs56n9))
	- To pull value, the customer must be able to see that value and be willing to exchange some economic unit for it. For an internal product, this could be adoption (e.g., having different business units adopt a common authentication system). For an external product, the unit can be revenue; or in the case of a product with indirect or ad-based monetization, such as a social media tool, it might be time engaged with the product. For a government or not-for-profit organization, it can be the adoption rate of a newly-launched digital offering ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1sb8h82f94sq8rsvha6z7j))
	- Using any of these scenarios, consider the last time you derived new value from a product or went back to using a product that you had previously not used. What triggered that exchange of value in terms of spending your time or your money? Chances are that it was a new feature that met your usage needs and perhaps delighted you in some way. Or it was the fix for a defect that was preventing you from using a product that you had otherwise valued. And here lies the key to defining what flows in a software value stream: if what we are pulling is new features and defect fixes, those are the flow items of a software value stream. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1sp8vw1nkmwb9cjwbfk360))
	- Flow Item: A unit of business value pulled by a stakeholder through a product‚Äôs value stream ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1sqnb9rsfxvfhfqa5kwbva))
	- If these are the flow items, that means we could characterize work across all the people and teams within a value stream as applying to one of these items‚Äîand we can. Given full visibility into every process and tool in the organization, you could identify exactly how many designers, developers, managers, testers, and help-desk professionals were involved with creating, deploying, and supporting a particular feature. The same goes for a defect. But is this the only work that is being done within the value streams? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1sqfanqy6c2mryjt1d718w))
	- The ‚ÄúMining the Ground Truth of Enterprise Toolchains‚Äù analysis of 308 enterprise IT tool networks (the study I noted in [Chapter 1](private://read/01h9v9x5kct1xhzfvvrrgnf9fm#9H5K0-02e15caf87a9436189b6d0daae3e8b94)) identified two other kinds of work that are invisible to the user but are pulled through the value stream by a different kind of stakeholder.[5](private://read/01h9v9x5kct1xhzfvvrrgnf9fm#ch3_fn5) First, there is work on risks. This includes the various kinds of security, regulation, and compliance that must be defined by business analysts, scheduled onto development backlogs, implemented, tested, deployed, and maintained. In other words, this is work that competes for priority over features and defects, and as such, is one of the primary flow items. This type of work is not pulled by the customer, as regulatory- or compliance-risk work is usually not visible to the customer until it is too late (e.g., a security incident that leads to a number of security defects being fixed and security features being added). It is instead pulled internally by the organization; for example, by the Chief Risk Officer and their team ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1sr8q7bj6x9e93tcqr5n2p))
	- The final and fourth kind of work is technical debt reduction, which describes the need to perform work on the software and infrastructure codebase that, if not done, will result in the reduced ability to modify or maintain that code in the future. For example, a focus on feature delivery can result in a large accumulation of technical debt. If work is not done to reduce that technical debt, then it could impede future ability to deliver features; for example, by making the software architecture too tangled to innovate on. [Table 3.1](private://read/01h9v9x5kct1xhzfvvrrgnf9fm#tab3-1) summarizes the four flow items. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1srgkyg1w0649kmcgaz19q))

	- By focusing first on flow, the other aspects of architecture such as infrastructure cost and information security can be planned for in relation to their business relevance ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1stmy8sev8efy3e21xnrhh))
	- For instance, investing in architecture to reduce cost before an Incubation Zone product is validated could be a waste when compared to rearchitecting around cost reduction once the product has demonstrated viability and is ready for the Transformation Zone. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1sv8cz6qm89cxm83s8hww1))
	- Rather than focusing on the software architecture to support any contingency, the focus should be on predicting the future flow of incidents through the product‚Äôs value stream and on optimizing the architecture for that. This means architecting for resiliency that minimizes the likelihood of those incidents and creating a software architecture, infrastructure architecture, and value stream architecture that can quickly respond to the remaining unforeseen incidents. The result is analogous to what the BMW Group did with the ‚Äúfingers‚Äù structure of the buildings: they predicted how the architecture needs to be adaptable to future flows rather than building in all of the support for those flows up front ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1sw9m2jm06wz41zxtam7px))
	- The four flow items follow the MECE principle of being mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. In other words, all work that flows in a software value stream is characterized by one‚Äîand only one‚Äîof the flow items. This means that activities such as prioritization of the various flow items are a zero-sum game, as we will explore in [Chapter 4](private://read/01h9v9x5kct1xhzfvvrrgnf9fm#DB7S0-02e15caf87a9436189b6d0daae3e8b94). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1sx9nxjma6ds5kj1ebvyye))
	- Finally, you‚Äôll see there is no separate flow item representing improvements to the Value Stream Network to improve flow. In the shift from project to product, the Value Stream Network itself needs to be treated as a product, with its own stable delivery team, and not as a project with a defined end. The majority of Value Stream Network improvements, be they connecting different stakeholders or creating dashboards for flow metrics, will fall on this team. In the cases where teams on a particular value stream need to make changes to their work process‚Äîfor example, to remove waste by switching from manual compliance checks to an automated security tool‚Äîthat work falls under the debt flow items for that team.

	- VALUE STREAM METRICS ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1t29ewtyhpd297vgx0w4an))
	- The goal of the Flow Framework is to make software delivery as visible as manufacturing and to do so at the business level. To accomplish that, we need a core set of metrics for tracking the flow of business value in software delivery ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1t2x3nhdxpt1f4dez3jwdw))
	- CHAPTER 4
	  
	  Capturing Flow Metrics ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1t3qrjy7hgqw3dbnp71ykd))
	- Just as the production line provides the BMW Group with visibility into physical production, value streams and the four flow items provide us with the abstraction that we need to see business value flow in software delivery. To obtain that visibility, we first need to identify the key metrics that are most relevant to tracking the productivity of each value stream. We then need a way of applying those metrics to our value streams ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1t473f2vhhevc37g3t760s))
	- The value streams were a direct mapping of business need to the factory flows. Value was clearly defined by the number of cars and the time it took to deliver each one. There was no complex manual mapping of projects to products to cars and back to the business. The quality of production was simply a count of the cars that needed fixes, as every car that made it down the line would be delivered, even if it required rework of some problematic component. The rework itself was just another part of the flow along the value streams ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1tmx676ehkh2mghppj6yvh))
	- That made quality just as visible as velocity. Velocity was the number of cars being completed on the line, and the rework area made quality equally transparent. How could we gain this level of visibility in the four flow items that we were delivering in IT ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1tnbfrgkcs4m81nm67n3ee))
	- The underlying flow metric ([Figure 4.1](private://read/01h9v9x5kct1xhzfvvrrgnf9fm#fig4-1)) is the simplest but also the most consequential. We need to track the target flow distribution of each of the four flow items for each value stream. For example, a value stream for a new product is likely to require a large proportion of features that need to be delivered in time for launch. In this case, a majority of the total work can be committed to feature flow; in other words, the value stream will be optimized for the delivery of new business value. Assuming that the new product has a limited number of customers prior to launch, such as beta testers, the amount of defect flow is likely to be low. If the new product is an experiment that is not intended to be released publicly, then the ratio of work on risks will likely be low as well. However, if the product is intended to be released to the market, the amount of risk work can be higher; and more contingencies for missed defects should be allocated.

	- In contrast, consider a value stream for an existing and entrenched product, such as a legacy back-end service that will continue to exist only to support mobile applications with data. The flow distribution for the value stream could be set to optimize for risk reduction and defect fixes, with minimal or no investment in feature flow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1tqw0zfhfzpgp11a319mx0))
	- Flow Distribution: The proportion of each flow item within a value stream, adjusted depending on the needs of each stream to maximize business value.
	  
	  We can use flow distribution to tailor value streams to the type of results that we need to deliver to the business. In addition, flow distribution can be tuned to the particular product-maturity life cycle stage, or zone, that the product is in. For instance, I have deployed both the Three Horizons Framework methodology[2](private://read/01h9v9x5kct1xhzfvvrrgnf9fm#ch4_fn2) and, more recently, Moore‚Äôs Zone Management at Tasktop. Making this explicit to each of the managers and teams working on the corresponding products allowed them to set the flow distribution and the talent and processes supporting the value streams, matching the business goals of the horizon or zone. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1trkp32a16hdy6xn8hmc1z))
	- In addition to defining the flow distribution for value streams and investment zones, it can be set directionally for an entire organization in order to align all delivery with a high-level business goal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1twv4zeck6wrcspzanyykg))

	- With a product mind-set, investing new staff in a value stream needs to be modeled in a similar way to how ramp time for salespeople needs to be understood for a functional sales model. Any investment that has to produce results within six months has to come from existing‚Äînot new‚Äîcapacity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb1v9gecz3d5h1w3ym338nw1))

	- To see a balanced flow distribution, flow items should be of a similar level of effort or size. If the average feature takes four times the work of the average defect, a stacked bar chart would show four times the defect compared to feature flow. This is not inherently bad, as the point of flow items is that they encapsulate units of value and work that are meaningful to the business, however that value is assigned ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbs5wgwcqhjd7636vn2mjz1a))
	- Flow distribution can span any time frame or state-of-flow items, be that understanding everything active or done for the current release or estimating future capacity. In addition to distribution, we need a more specific measure of how much business value is being delivered to the customer. To do that, we need to measure the number of each flow item being completed over a unit of time.
	  
	  This is flow velocity. It is adapted from the Agile concept of velocity, which determines how many units of work (e.g., story points) a team delivers in a time period (e.g., a two-week sprint).[4](private://read/01h9v9x5kct1xhzfvvrrgnf9fm#ch4_fn4) Flow velocity uses the same concept but applies it to the four flow items and is a simpler and less granular measure. For instance, if ten features and five risks are completed for a release, the flow velocity for that release is fifteen. [Figure 4.4](private://read/01h9v9x5kct1xhzfvvrrgnf9fm#fig4-4) shows a sample flow velocity dashboard that visualizes progress toward meeting a value stream‚Äôs flow velocity target for each flow item, contrasting progress to the last iteration‚Äôs total.

	- we realized years ago that we needed a metric that represented productivity from our customers‚Äô point of view, in terms of how much we delivered to customers and how quickly we went from accepting the customer request to delivery. This is where flow velocity and flow time come in.
	  
	  Measurements such as the number of lines of code determine how much of a particular type of work was done by a developer, not how many units of value were delivered. A single feature, such as changing the behavior of the ‚ÄúLike‚Äù button in a product, could take very few lines of code but a large amount of analysis and design. A single line change in a mission-critical mainframe application can take days of impact analysis. So, while code-centric metrics are relevant to understanding more fine-grained aspects of work happening on various value streams, they are not suitable for encapsulating business value ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtmjmr5aatmgsgs326antxd))
	- As such, flow velocity metrics are more suited to track productivity and delivery trends within a value stream than across value streams. However, when the context of a flow item is similar‚Äîfor example, the need to implement a regulatory requirement such as from GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) across all products‚Äîcross-value-stream comparisons can become relevant. If one value stream is much more productive at implementing a new privacy protocol than others, there could be a case for extracting the code that it is using into a common API that will be used by other value streams for the same purpose. This is exactly how developers think already, and this kind of value stream thinking can make the case for investing in an API as a new value stream easier to justify for the organization.
