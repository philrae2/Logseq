- Quotes:
	 - This is why Jesus told his disciples never to [[worry]]—despite the fact that they were going to face persecution and death (Matthew 6:25-34). When God’s love becomes our sole source  of Life moment-by-moment, we will have no regrets about the past and no fears about the future, for we are fulfilled and are trusting God in the the present.
