		- Reading on a subject matter will not make a good at that topic. You must apply the knowledge first hand and experience the same situation in order to learn and understand.
		- Books provide valuable lessons and observations, but experience is what shapes the leader.
		- Problem solving is messy. There is rarely an objectively correct recommendation that stands out from all the options available to a client.
		  collapsed:: true
			- It is very difficult to know if a strategy will work. A very good strategy often looks exactly like a very bad strategy. The results from a set of correctly structured analyses often tells us little by themselves.
			- The ability to remain flexible and adapt is what matters.
				- Analysis is messy. Data is flawed. It has holes. Data is misleading. Best practices fail. Consultants uncover new information every single day of an engagement that slightly nudges the original hypothesis.
		- Strategy is a process of constantly iterating the implications of the findings.
			- The solution doesn't appear without the continued application of the frameworks, hypotheses, and analyses.
		- The most gifted team member should not be the manager as they will be bogged down by the daily burden of coordinating the team.
		  collapsed:: true
			- The playmaker should have the freedom to roam around the field, knowing the captain will orchestrate the game around them.
		- What you do does not matter. How you do it matters, and it matters intensely.
		- Artists must sign their work. You must have pride in what you do. You must want your name to be attached to the project and its outcomes.
		- The founding mandate of an organization plays a critical role in determining its strategy to execute that mandate.
			- When approaching a problem question the basic premise and test the conditions of its foundations.
		- Aggregating the detailed studies from external parties does not lead to a better engagement. It leads to a summary of errors.
		- Test ideas rigorously before implementation.
		- Always try to come up with alternatives to solutions so at least you have considered more than one option.
