- Reference Notes;
	 - The great majority of defenders of the idea of a real hell of eternal torment...never really get around to addressing properly the question of whether we can make moral sense of God's acts in the great cosmic drama of creation, redemption, and damnation. They invariably imagine they have done so, but only because they have not sufficiently distinguished that question from whichever one it is that genuinely preoccupies them—which these days tends to be the question of whether a free, rational agent, in order to be truly free, or truly capable of a relation of love with God, must have the power to condemn himself or herself to everlasting dereliction, and whether then God will allow him or her to do so out of regard for the high dignity of this absolutely indispensable autonomy.
		 - No matter how one answers that particular question, the always more significant question must be whether—even if it should turn out that a rational soul really can in some abstract sense freely and justly condemn itself to everlasting torture—this fact would truly permit us to love an omnipotent and omniscient God who has elected to create a reality in which everlasting torture is a possible final destiny for any of his creatures.
