- It turns out there's an established and systematic way for bringing ideas to reality: professional project management.
	 - I found out about professional project management in my years in corporate tech. I remember looking back at my college years and wishing I knew this back then. I could have done a better job and could have avoided some unneeded stress and wasted time.

- I'm not a natural organizer.
	 - I know people who get a kick out of organizing weddings and parties. I avoid these projects as much as possible.

	 - But I was promoted as a project manager and I eventually started my own business. I needed to do a good job bringing ideas to reality despite not being a natural at it. Professional project management helped me do these.

- Professional project management is really just two things:
	 - a way of breaking down a project (instead of one messy blob of project management work)

	 - processes for systematically doing these components of project work

	 - The project management tools in this rBook are "professional" because they come from generations of people who manage projects for a living.

- Professional project management helps us do our projects the right way.
	 - Or at least __a__ right way. The approach I share in this rBook is one of many, but it is the one produced by the biggest project management professional organization in the world, the [Project Management Institute (PMI)](https://www.pmi.org/).

	 - The framework and project management tools I share in this rBook are the ones I found most useful from the [Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge), the book of standards published by the PMI.

	 - The flagship certification of PMI is [Professional Project Manager (PMP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Professional). I have been a PMP since 2007. I started teaching PM even while I was preparing for the certification exam. Since then, I have trained hundreds of project managers. This rBook is my attempt in translating that training to Roam.

	 - Project management is a skill, so you need experience to get good at it. But you'll get better faster if you have this tried-and-tested way of looking at projects, and if you know how to use project management tools.

- Professional project management lessens stress and increases brainspace.
	 - These project management tools act like a checklist. You'll rest assured that you didn't miss anything in your work as a project manager. If you neglect certain aspects, you at least neglect them consciously. Like many kinds of work, project management involves a tradeoff between time and thoroughness.

	 - These project management tools allow you to document your project management work. This lessens worry, as well as frees up your mind for other things.
		 - Documenting your project management work is also a favor you are doing for your future selves. If you need to lead a similar project in the future, you don't start from scratch.

- Professional project management reduces wasted time.
	 - After an initial investment of learning these tools and using them, you will be more efficient in your project management work. You can use the time you save for your life outside of work, or to bring more ideas to reality.

	 - Concurrently bringing multiple ideas to reality is my main reason for using Roam for project management. All your projects can be managed in one software. I'll share how I do this in [[ðŸ§° Chapter 12: Project-driven Stallion\Rider Productivity]].

- I'm a believer of professional project management. I hope this chapter explains why.
	 - I am happy with this business I have built and the projects I have brought to reality. They were once just ideas. Project management helped me make them real.

	 - And as I mentioned in the [prologue](((77d9e2cd-bf42-4787-abe8-ad12f1600110))), project management allows me to honor my Yes to inspiration and have some influence on my future.

- [[Next chapter]]
	 - When I was new to project management, I was so enthusiastic about it that I tried to use it for everything. After more than a decade as a project management professional, I now know that project management is the right for some situations and the wrong one for others. We will learn when to use these tools in the next chapter: [[ðŸ§­ Chapter 2 | When To Use (And Not Use) These Project Management Tools]]
