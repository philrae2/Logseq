- Emotion Intelligence and Conflict 
  collapsed:: true
	- Having just two words to start with might not seem like a lot of ammunition, but  trust me, you can use “what” and “how” to  calibrate nearly any question. “Does this look like something you would like?”  can become “How does this look to you?” or “What about this works for you?” You  can even ask, “What about this doesn’t work for you?” and you’ll probably  trigger quite a bit of useful information from your counterpart.
	- When someone indulges in their emotions in the workplace, you usually end up with conflict.
	- It's impossible to win an argument, because even if we  are the victor, the other person feels inferior. And that's a surefire way to make somebody reject your 
	  thinking.
- Motivations
  collapsed:: true
	- All negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires and needs. Don't let yourself be fooled by the surface.
	- Ask yourself what they are feeling? What are they trying to say
- No
  collapsed:: true
	- Instead of getting inside with logic or feigned smiles, then, we get there by asking for “No.” It’s the word that gives the speaker feelings of safety and control. “No” starts conversations and creates safe havens to get to the final “Yes” of commitment. An early “Yes” is often just a cheap, counterfeit dodge.
- Solutions
  collapsed:: true
	- Calibrate your questions to point your counterpart toward solving your problem. This will encourage them to expend their energy on devising a solution.
- Asking Questions
  collapsed:: true
	- The person in control of a conversation is the person asking the questions. Guide people to your point of view with questions, not arguments.
