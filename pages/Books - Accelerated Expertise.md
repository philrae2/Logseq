	- Chapter 1 - The value of expertise and the need to capture knowledge
		- Through the auspices of the US Air Force Research Laboratory, these workshops brought together leading academic, private sector, and DoD specialists in areas of training and expertise studies. The objective was to create a design and roadmap for investigations aimed at developing robust and broadly applicable methods for:
			- 1 Accelerating the achievement of high levels of proficiency (i.e., expertise)
			- 2 Facilitating the retention of knowledge and skill
		- In the context of this hiatus problem, attendees at the workshops focused on addressing the following proficiency and accelerated learning goals. These goals were originally discussed in the context of the types of problems faced by United States Air Force (USAF) personnel specifically. In this volume we tap into the USAF examples, but we address these goals more broadly:
			- How can we develop operational definitions and measures of proficiency at a fine grain?
			- How can we develop methods for identifying expert mentors and revealing their knowledge and strategies?
			- How can we best design training to promote skill retention and prevent skill decay during periods of hiatus?
			- How can we train for adaptivity and the need to cope with the ever-changing workplace and changing and challenging activities?
			- How can we train for resilience and the need to cope with complexity when unexpected events stretch resources and capabilities?
			- Which military and private sector jobs require high levels of proficiency?
			- How can we construct optimal strategies for mitigating at least some skill decay while on a long-term hiatus
		- ^^Clearly, it does no good to accelerate the rate of learning if that learning cannot be retained and effectively used on the job^^
		- Domain practitioners who achieve high levels of proficiency provide technical judgment to speed decision-making in time-critical events. They provide resilience to operations by resolving tough problems, anticipating future demands and re-planning, and acting prudently by judgment rather than by rule. High proficiency practitioners exercise effective technical leadership in ambiguous or complex situations, often by communicating subtle features that other people will not see until they are pointed out. Often they are also the ones who understand the history, the inter-dependencies of units and processes, and the culture of their complex organizations—knowledge that is often essential in actually “getting things done” (e.g., Stein, 1997).

		- As workplaces and jobs become more cognition-intensive, organizations need to take traditional notions of training to new levels, and well into the territory of complex systems. Workers in sociotechnical systems must be trained to be adaptive, so that they can cope with the ever-changing world and ever-changing workplace. People must be trained to be resilient, so that they can cope with complexity when unexpected events stretch resources and capabilities. And workers must be trained faster. Intelligent systems technology, and intelligent use of technology, will certainly play a critical role in this.
		- Likewise, domain practitioners can readily identify those important concepts in a domain that seem to be especially difficult for others to fully comprehend (Dawson Saunders et al., 1990). A critical gap, however, is that a robust, general procedure for doing this has not been formulated in such a way that anyone might implement it. Knowledge-intensive organizations rely on decision-makers to produce mission critical decisions based on inputs from multiple domains (Becerra-Fernandez et al., 2004). The decision-maker needs an understanding of many specific sub-domains that influence the decision-making process, coupled with the experience that allows for quick and decisive action based on such information (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995).
			- Comment: Decision makers need multi-faceted views and understanding of many specific sub-domains to make informed decisions. #[[decision making]]
		- An additional recent awareness is that [[knowledge management]] via knowledge capture and knowledge repositories is only a part of the solution to workforce problems. If an organization could capture the knowledge embedded in clever people’s minds, all it would need is a better knowledge-management system. The failure of such systems to capture tacit knowledge is one of the greatest disappointments of knowledge-management initiatives to date.
		- What is needed are new approaches to knowledge training; in particular, a method for accelerating the achievement of high levels of proficiency
		- A number of recent research and development programs established across the Department of Defense have called for more automation, in an effort to achieve a number of important goals, such as reduced manning of work systems, greater efficiency and effectiveness, and reduced mental workload. The increased complexity of systems causes errors and poor performance. Therefore, the argument goes, we add more automation to make operations simpler, more easily trained, and trainable to lower levels of expertise. We need to be able to use automation to eliminate the need for human supervisors in simulator-based training. And so forth. However, all our lessons learned in cognitive systems engineering and complexity theory imply that more automation may result in simplifications, but they will hide deeper complexity, and at those moments where resilience and high-performance are needed, there will have to be greater operator expertise
		- The first contributing factor, undisciplined automation, is defined as the automation of functions by designers and subsequent implementation by users without due regard for the downstream consequences for human performance… Automation bias is defined as unwarranted over-reliance on automation. It has been demonstrated to result in monitoring failures (vigilance problems) and accompanying decision biases usually involving unwarranted and uncritical trust in automation. In essence, control responsibility is ceded to the machine
		- The ARL research team referred to expertise in the sense of proficiency beyond rote skill; that is, critical thinking and tactical reasoning based on a rich knowledge base. Developing such expertise “takes job-focused training, appropriate on-the-job experiences, mentoring by expert job performers, and, above all, time.” Hawley refers to the concept of deliberate practice, arguing that: More than 50 years of training research across the DoD has shown that instructional design issues often trump issues pertaining to training equipment and simulator fidelity … Technology-intensive systems require considerable operator and crew expertise for effective use. Research indicates that developing these levels of expertise requires several years of full-time effort just to reach the journeyman level (p. 1). Finally, Hawley points to organizational issues: In spite of the best intentions with respect to training and job preparation, the Army’s formal personnel system makes it difficult to keep operators and crews in one position long enough to reach necessary levels of on-the-job competence. Unsupportive personnel practices can undo the best-laid training plans and practices. Hawley concludes by advocating “expertise-focused training” and echoing a core principle in Human-Centered Computing: “Technology can amplify human expertise, but not substitute for it.” This expresses another of the themes that we explore in this book

		- But this report is distinguished from many previous works on training vien its relians on the Collins et al. notion of cognitive apprenticeship, the idea of facilitating the achievement of high levels of proficiency and expertise, and the need to focus on “real-world contexts” (p. 12). The report by Daniel Druckman and Robert Bjork referred to “modeling expertise,” by which they meant that training should involve activities of the sort one would expect of an apprentice; that is, learning in context by seeing the master at work. The report emphasized the need to understand how experts reason and what experts know

		- Defining Accelerated Learning
			- Rapidized Learning
				- The idea of training individuals to achieve some minimal level of proficiency at a rate faster than usual
			- Accelerated proficiency
				- The idea of getting individuals to achieve high levels of proficiency at a rate faster than ordinary
			- Facilitated retention
				- The idea of of making learning less susceptible to decay
			- Rapidized cognitive task analysis
			- Rapidized transposition of knowledge from the operational setting to the training setting
		- Accelerated Learning in the Sense of Accelerated Proficiency
			- The most succinct way of saying this is: “Can we turn an apprentice into an expert in less than ten years?” Accelerated learning in this sense refers not only to the idea of hastening the achievement of a minimum level proficiency; it reaches across the proficiency scale to the question of how to accelerate the achievement of expertise, and whether that is even possible. It is widely recognized that many individuals and teams must be trained to high levels of proficiency, even to the expert level, because of the need for operations that rely on cognitive work and require robust, resilient and adaptive response.
				- Robustness is the ability to maintain effectiveness across a range of tasks, situations, and conditions.
				- Resilience is the ability to recover from a destabilizing perturbation in the work as it attempts to reach its primary goals.
				- Adaptivity is the ability to employ multiple ways to succeed and the capacity to move seamlessly among them.
			- ^^Fundamental to the achievement of robustness, resilience and adaptivity is the opportunity for practice at problems that stretch current competency (Feltovich et al., 1997).^^ Professionals must acquire knowledge and reasoning skills that pertain to critical domain goals but which must be exercised in differing situations or contexts. Capability must transfer in this sense.
		- Skills Decay
			- Skill decay is particularly salient and problematic in situations where individuals receive initial training on knowledge and skills that they may not be required to use or exercise for extended periods of time. Reserve personnel in the military, for example, may be provided formal training only once or twice a year. When called up for active duty, however, it is expected that they will need only a limited amount of refresher training, if any, to reacquire any skill that has been lost and subsequently to perform their mission effectively
		- Rapid Transposition
			- The core notion of rapidized transposition is to quickly transfer lessons learned from the workplace or operational setting into the schoolhouse.

			- Trainers have noted that by the time lessons learned actually get into the training materials (6 to 9 months’ delay), the situation in the field has changed. Furthermore, archives of “lessons learned” are quickly outdated and, as archives, are of limited accessibility and usability. In an ideal mechanism, the apprentice or journeyman who is in training would be able to “stand on the shoulders” of the experienced practitioner who is in the field (or workplace), perhaps via some form of direct or social network-based communication. Indeed, informal and formal social networks (“buddy nets”) have developed in which warfighters communicate here’s something new that we encountered today. Another approach will be to quickly inject emerging tactical scenarios into virtual training environments. But that is by no means easy.
				- Eliciting knowledge that is necessary for adaptivity and resilience from the experiences of professionals will provide critical content for live and virtual training (Nemeth, 2009). This requires: (1) rapid transfer of knowledge from the professional to the trainer without significant increase in anyone’s workload, (2) rapid transformation of the transferred knowledge into products that can be shared, preserved, and readily used by the trainer, and (3) rapid transmission of the preserved knowledge via the trainer to the trainee.
