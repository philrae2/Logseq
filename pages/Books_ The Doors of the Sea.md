- Questions: 
	 - Is science based on what is measurable and knowable? And anything that is beyond that constraint beyond science? Is saying time will expand science's reach, a synonym for faith?

- Takeaways:
	 - Before we engage in conversation with opposing views, agree on a shared definition of the topic. 
		 - In cases of religion we often discuss "God" but we often don't clearly define who God is.
			 - If you don't believe in a "God" is there a "God" that could be real that transcends your definition of God.

			 - If  you do believe in "God" are there aspects of your "God" that maybe wrong or incomplete? 

			 - Are we boxing God in to fit our definition of Him, even though He exists beyond our mental capacity.
				 - Science is based on what is measurable and knowable, a God who can be constrained within this box can be easily dismissed by science. But the reaches of science is limited, science can only rely on time to expand it's known and knowable space. To claim and rely on the powers to disprove "God" is unscientific as God can exist outside the known space of what science knows. To say time will eventually provide science evidence to disprove God is a form of faith.

- Notes:
	 - Regarding arguments about [[God]] and his intervention or non-intervention of natural and man-made events of destruction, like wars, famines, earthquakes and tsunamis:
		 - Often these arguments take issue with a God of their own devising. Q: An article of [[J.L. Mackie]] from 1955 argues that we must conclude from the evidence of history and nature that if God is indeed [[omnipotent]], he manifestly is not good, and that if he is good, he manifestly is not omnipotent. It is an argument, says Rosenbaum (author of an article regarding God and the Sumatra tsunami), that so far no one has succeeded in refuting.

			 - In point of fact, though, there is no argument here to refute; the entire case is premised upon an inane [[anthropomorphism]]--abstracted from any living system of belief--- that reduces God to a finite ethical agent, a limited psychological personality, whose purposes are measurable upon the same scale as ours, and whose ultimate ends for his creatures do not transcend the cosmos as we perceive it. 
				 - This is not to say that it is an argument without considerable emotional and even moral force; but of logical force there is none. ^^Unless one can see the beginning and end of all things, unless one possesses a divine, eternal vantage upon all of time, unless one knows the precise nature of the relation between divine and created freedom, unless indeed one can fathom infinite wisdom, one can draw no conclusions from finite experience regarding the coincidence in  God of omnipotence and perfect goodness.^^ One may still hate God for worldly suffering, if one chooses, or deny him, but one cannot in this way "disprove" Him. 
					 - Question: Do we have the ability to discuss omnipotence and [[omnibenevolent]] correctly if we ourselves don't possess those qualities? Omnipotence and omnibenevolence are outside our capacity to fully comprehend yet we discuss God, who are those qualities?

		 - Many arguments against God does not address the Christian belief in an ancient alienation from God that has wounded creation in its uttermost depths and reduced cosmic time to a shadowy vestige of the world God truly intends, and enslaved creation to spiritual and terrestrial powers hostile to God; nor certainly does he concern himself with the biblical narrative of redemption.
			 - Question: If God is [[omnipotent]] can't He take the alienation of humanity and heal its resulting wound?

		 - Q: However these arguments should not be ignored, it is Christianity that not only proclaimed a God of infinite goodness but equated that goodness with infinite love. The atheist who argues from worldly suffering, even crudely, against belief in a God both benevolent and omnipotent is still someone whose moral expectations of God - and moral disappointments - have been shaped at the deepest level by the language of Christian faith. The actual arguments
employed may not demonstrate a keen understanding of the Christian tradition, and they may fail strictly in terms of their logic; but they are not directed merely at a phantom, without any substance whatsoever.

		 - Reasoning for God's actions 
			 - Q:  ^^To  assert that every finite contingency is solely and  unambiguously the  effect of a  single will working all  things - without any deeper mystery of created freedom - is to assert nothing but that the world is what it is, for any meaningful distinction between the will of God and the simple totality of cosmic eventuality has collapsed.^^ ^^If all that occurs, in the minutest detail and in the entirety, of its design, is only the expression of one infinite volition that makes no real room within its transcendent determinations for other, secondary, subsidiary but free agencies (and so for some element of chance and absurdity), then the world is both arbitrary and necessary, both meaningful in every part and meaningless in its totality, an expression of pure power and nothing else.^^ Even if the purpose of such a world is to prepare creatures to know the majesty and justice of its God, that majesty and justice are, in a very real sense, fictions of his will, impressed upon creatures by means both good and evil, merciful and cruel, radiant and monstrous - some are created for eternal bliss and others for eternal torment, and all for the sake of the divine drama of perfect and irresistible might. ^^Such a God, at the end of the day, is nothing but will, and so nothing but an infinite brute event; and the only adoration that such a God can evoke is an almost perfect coincidence of faith and nihilism. ^^ Quite  apart  from what I take to be the scriptural and philosophical incoherence of this concept of God, it provides an excellent  moral  case  for  atheism  - or,  for  that  matter, Gnosticism (but this too I will address below). 

			 - Equally problematic, in some ways, if far more spiritually sane, is the view that all suffering and death should be seen as the precisely apportioned and condign recompense for human sin, balancing all accounts and contributing to a final harmony of all things. It is a pleasing vision of things, in some ways, though quite horrifying in others; it is also a vision so pointlessly complex as to verge upon banality. ^^If it gives us comfort to believe that the death of an infant from disease and the death of a serial murderer late in life from a heart attack, congenital madness and innate genius, the long fortunate life of one of nature's Romans and the brief miserable life of a born pauper are all determined by a precise calculation of what each and every one of us deserves, then it is a comfort sustained by absurdity.^^  If nothing else, one might ask, what of all the particular instances of animal suffering (which no conscience should find it easy to ignore as unimportant)? And, anyway, Christ forbade his disciples, in ^^Luke 13:1-5, to believe that there is a secret due proportion between misfortune and culpability^^: neither those whose blood Pilate mingled with the sacrifices nor those eighteen upon whom the Tower of Siloam fell met their fates on account of some special degree of iniquity on their parts. A^^nd he also made it quite clear, in Matthew 20:1-16, that there is no distinction among the rewards reserved for the righteous corresponding to the diversity of their merits: those who labor all the day and those who labor but an hour receive the same wages. ^^
