- **Note:**
	 - We often feel that to climb the ladder at work, we need to bring attention to ourselves and the work that we put out. There are several ways to do this and the best way to set us up for leadership is to learn people skills rather than chasing more skill sets. 

	 - While improving our business judgment, we should ensure that our emotional intelligence is also improving. Stop chasing more skills like programming, rather play to your strengths and improve your people skills.
