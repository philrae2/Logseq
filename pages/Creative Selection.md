		- 7 Elements essential to Apple's software success
			- Inspiration: Thinking big ideas and imagining what might be possible
			- Collaboration: Working together well with other people and seeking to combine your complementary strengths
			- Craft: Applying skill to achieve high-quality results and always striving to do better
			- Diligence: Doing the necessary grunt work and never resorting to shortcuts or half measures
			- Decisiveness: Making tough choices and refusing to delay or procrastinate
			- Taste: Developing a refined sense of judgment and finding the balance that produces a pleasing and integrated whole
			- Empathy: Trying to see the world from other people's perspectives and creating work that fits into their lives and adapts to their needs
		- Apple employees felt that imposing a fixed methodology might snuff out innovation. (This would only be a concern if the workers are already proactive and innovative). Building out processes and guidance documents
		- #Innovation
			- We never waited around for brilliant flashes of insight that might solve problems in one swoop. (Our works and methods was an evolution, an outgrowth of deliberate attention to the task at hand while keeping our goal and in mind.) We moved forward as a group, in a stepwise fashion, from problem to design to demo to shipping product, taking each promising concept and trying to come up ways to make it better.
	- 1 - The Demo
	  collapsed:: true
		- **The iPhone keyboard was not a customer request, but a guess by Apple to think what features Apple thought would be innovative and valuable.** It went against the standard of the time, physical keyboard buttons like the keyboard blackberry.
			- (Development doesn't always delivering what the customers want but to be innovative and add delightful functions. We can look at our favorite program's features and see if we can reuse them into our own solutions)
		- Steve Jobs made all important product decisions for Apple. He used demo sessions to help him decide how Apple software should look and feel and function.
			- Steve was specific, detailed, and ensured the software was as intuitive and straightforward as possible.
			- Steve erred for simplicity and perfection.
			- He was passionate about the final quality of the product was deeply invested in ensuring a successful outcome. He was a leader because he cared.
		- **Apple employees had found success by connecting technology to delight users and fulfill their needs and ease their pain points, rather than relying on market research and strictly following user story requests. Rather they relied on their ingenuity and problem solving.**
		- **Apple leadership had high standards, abhorred lazy justifications, and expected the same from the people they work with.**
		- Apple employees were passionate about their work, even when designing the look and layout for the iPad keyboard.
		- Gaining favor with Steve Jobs was less about where you were in the org chart of the organization but rather what value you could offer to the company. Did you make the organization better?
		- **Steve Jobs and his trusted circle communicated with minimal yet clear and concise words. They preferred solutions that were simple and intuitive.**
	- 2 - The Crystal Ball #demos
	  collapsed:: true
		- Software demos need to be convincing enough to explore an idea, to communicate a step towards making a product, even though the demo is not the product itself. Demos should be be clear what is important to communicate (what to include) and what can be left out (things we can remove or take short-cuts on). We need to think through which functions to demo need the correct level of detail.
		- When you do a demo, think of the intended audience and make specific decisions on what should be included.
		- When developing start to look for areas that are stalled and be willing to change course. Areas where you can take short cuts and skip unnecessary effort. Remove distractions to focus attention to where it needs to be.
		- Ensure detailed documentation when working on areas you will need for future reference.
		- **Apple didn't separate ideation, innovation and research from the execution of those ideas. They took part in the tedium and grunt work of building the solutions and in doing so learned and understood their solutions more deeply**.
			- **When innovating it's going to take a significant time failing to reach that one success. So don't beat yourself if you fail, but rather continue to fail and learn. Don't be discouraged when things go wrong. Take careful notes of each experiment and attempt and bring that understanding to lead you to success.**
			- Spend more time working on an influential idea. Inventions are 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. Ideas are nothing without the hard work to make them real.
	- 4 - One Simple Rule
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Optimization -Programmers waste an enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worry about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are concerned. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.**
		- Steve Jobs practiced a lot to prepare for his demos. Even practicing a month before the demo or press release.
		- **In any complex effort, communicating a well-articulated vision for what you're trying to do is the starting point for figuring out how to do it.** #planning #[[product vision]]
	- 5 - The Hardest Problem
	  collapsed:: true
		- When problems are difficult and messy—get organized. Make sure the problem space is as clean as can be and the solutions that you have are pristine and structured.
		- When asking for help and taking the advice of others, you can create investment on your success by sharing progress updates on your project and the positive outcomes due to their recommendations and feedback.
		- People matter more than projects. (good, smart, clever people anyway. Lazy ones may not probably be worth your investment and just bring you down)
	- 6 - The Keyboard Derby
	  collapsed:: true
		- Demos should serve as early alarm signals. If the demo doesn't go well consider the consequences. Do you need to drop everything to make sure this piece of functionality has improved quality or you need more resources? Or will it be OK after a few sprints?
		- Demos have to be concrete and specific in order to guide the work, because unsophisticated ideas are hard to discuss constructively without an artifact to illustrate it.
		- Demos helps provide feedback and a catalyst for action to create the next demo. The more often we demo the more feedback we get to help us take into action.
		- Do demos instead of brainstorming as brainstorming is faux work. Nothing really gets done except talking but no tangible thing has been created.
	- 7 - QWERTY
		- Always seek to improve your solution. It can always be better.
		- We need to have empathy for our users. We need to see the world from other people's perspectives and creating work that fits into their lives and adapts to their needs.
		- Decision-making in product development has to be clearly justified and aligned to the top level product vision.
		- Design is how it works.
			- "Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it (a product) looks like. People think it's this veneer—that designers are handed this box and told, "Make it look good!" That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
			- Shallow beauty in products doesn't serve people. Product design should strive for depth, for a beauty rooted in what a product does, not merely in how it looks and feels. Form should follow function. Objects should explain themselves.
	- 8 - Convergence
	  collapsed:: true
		- Is the term used at Apple to describe the final phase of making an Apple product, after the features had been locked down and the programming and design teams spent the last three or four months fixing bugs and polishing detail.
		- Concrete and specific demos should serve as catalysts for creative decisions. They should force a good judgment to be made about what changes needed to be made and what should be deleted.
		- Creative selection: demo -> feedback -> demo
		- Steve Jobs made high level decisions but also in the weeds as opposed to detached managers who make ill-informed decisions
		- Look for anti-patterns within the organization that block continuous learning from happening from projects. You need to live in the products that you build in order to see if they are actually good.
		- (Is there a way to improve product development for clients when you aren't well versed on the usage of the application and relying on the users as the business owner)
	- 9 - Intersection
	  collapsed:: true
		- > The reason that Apple is able to create products like the iPad is because we've always tried to be at the intersection of technology and liberal arts, to be able to get the best of both, to make extremely advanced products from a technology point of view, but also have them be intuitive, easy to use, fun to use, so that they really fit the users. The users don't have to come to them, they come to the users.
		- Consider the mental load we place on our users when designing applications and solutions for our software. To make products more approachable, designers must lighten the load on people trying to use the things they make. Even small simplifications make a difference.
			- Veer towards #simplicity and don't be afraid to remove features in order to lighten the mental load we place on users. (e.g., the word suggestion bar originally planned for iPhone keyboards)
		- Good heuristics in development don't come in brilliant flashes, but only after patient searches. However, heuristics are subjective.
		- To make great products at Apple it took a combination of creative selection, the seven essential elements and a combination of people and commitment. This manner of culture formation works bets with the groups and teams remain small, when the interpersonal interactions are habitual and rich rather than occasional and fleeting.
		- High quality results is mostly in the quality of the doing.
