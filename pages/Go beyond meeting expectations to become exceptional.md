- **Note:**
	- Seek out opportunities that are challenging that no one wants to do or no one sees. Make sure that even though it is challenging, that opportunities helps you grow and improve personally.
	- Don't settle for mediocrity and what's expected. Go beyond the minimum and exceed the bare minimum expectations.
