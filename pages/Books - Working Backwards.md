	- Introduction
	  collapsed:: true
		- Jeff Bezos described Amazon in this way: "Our culture is four things: customer obsession instead of competitor obsession instead of competitor obsession; willingness to think long term, with a longer investment horizon that most of our peers; eagerness to invent, which of course goes hand in hand with failure; and then finally, taking professional pride in operational excellence."

	  collapsed:: true
		- Be obsessive about customer focus and set high standards.
		- Underpromise and overdeliver to ensure that customer expectations were exceeded.
		- Chase perfection. Have relentlessly "unreasonably high standards"

		- Make your company's principles integral to daily activities such as they act as the frameworks for decision making, taking action, and other business processes.
		- **Amazon's Leadership Principles**
			- Customer Obsession
				- Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
				  id:: 9b7ee75d-024e-4b3e-985c-186de29b7a07
			- Ownership
				- Leaders are owners. They think in the long term and don't sacrifice long term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond their own team. They never say, "that's not my job."
				  id:: 3dfe8077-9b1b-4fb9-b269-5055239ef403
			- Invent and simplify
				- Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are extremely aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be understood for long periods of time.
			- Are right, a lot.
				- Leaders have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm beliefs.
			- Learn and Be curious.
				- Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
			- Hire and Develop the best
				- Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognized exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
			- Insist on the Highest Standards
				- Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality-products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed.
				  id:: 28e74c41-28f2-4476-a0e3-1f66ba211998
			- Think Big
				- Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspire results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
			- Bias for Action
			  id:: 78260893-db5e-42aa-a0b0-02c8df61feea
				- Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking.
				  id:: 8236c43c-6e3d-4cda-93f7-d86762b35dd6
			- Frugality
				- Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.
			- Earn Trust
				- Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
				  id:: 764d4c31-6802-4372-a1e3-195fefd3aa58
			- Dive Deep
				- Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them.
				  id:: c0381b2c-1b57-4c99-b28a-f91bafef977c
			- Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
				- Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly. 
				  id:: 93fa35b8-09cd-4068-a692-8d1541fee439
			- Deliver Results
				- Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
		- Mechanisms: Reinforcing the Leadership Principles
		  collapsed:: true
			- If you don't change the underlying condition that created a problem, you should expect the problem to recur.
				- Even though my current company (OBI) has core values, are there corresponding mechanisms to put them into practice? #comment
			- Mechanisms ensure that the Leadership Principles are translated into actions.
				- High-level expectations are created from leadership. Then those high-level goals are then further broken down and refined to granular goals and increasingly detailed objectives by individuals and groups.
					- How do we create broken down and refined granular goals down to individuals and groups? Can we use [[Mutual Learning]] as a methodology to get to the individual level of personalized goals that reflect back to the leadership principles #comment
				- Those granular objectives and goals are then prioritized according to their alignment with the organizational goals. The progress is then measured via stop light by an oversight team.
				- Amazon prevents dysfunctional behavior by employees through long-term pay, through stock-based compensation. This ensures employees care about the long-term health of the company over short-term or individual gains.
	- Chapter 2 - Hiring, Amazon's Unique Bar Raiser Process
	  collapsed:: true
		- #[[Decision Making]] When answering a question. What kind of information do you need to solve the problem? What kind of questions should you be asking?
	- Chapter 3 - Organizing Separable, Single-Threaded Leadership
		- Technical dependencies and organizational dependencies slow down innovation and time building. Dependencies waste our time by requiring more coordination and less time doing.
		- Technology dependencies are simplified through microservices-based architecture and APIs. This allows for creations of small autonomous teams removing bottlenecks.
		- Most businesses and organizations see morale boosting as a problem to be solved through entertainment and social interaction. Amazon's approach to morale was to attract world-class talent and create an environment in which they had maximum latitude to invent and build things to delight customers.
		- Teams and groups had a clear vision of what their goals are the input metrics used to measure their progress and performance. Agreement with all stakeholders were also solicited in designing of the metrics.
		- Amazon broke down dependencies by creating small and autonomous teams (no larger than ten members). Technical dependencies were broken down through the use of APIs. These teams were evaluated by well defined "fitness function." This is the sum of a weighted series of metrics.
			- The teams served as the business owner and was led by a multi-disciplined top-flight leader. The leader must have deep technical expertise and possess excellent business judgment.
		- > Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you're probably being slow. You need to be good at correcting bad decisions. If you're good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive
			- Long term thinking, in the form of up-front thinking, generates compounding returns over time. Sometimes it's best to start out slow in order to move fast.
			- Small team centered processes mostly benefits tangled work environments like product development. Small  autonomous team centered work, was not beneficial to offices like HR.
		- Great teams were not predicted by their size but rather if they had a leader with the appropriate skills, authority, and the experience to staff and manage a team whose sole focus was to get the job done. This evolved into single threaded leadership, where teams are only working and responsible for one thing.
			- > The best way to fail at inventing something is by making it somebody's part-time job.
			- If not single threaded, at minimum teams should have the bandwidth to complete their jobs effectively.
	- Chapter 4 - Communication: Narratives and the Six-Pager
	  id:: 4ea3dc8c-b200-4a25-ba78-fb5e4500e9b3
		- [[Amazon Six-Pager]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- “The six-pager can be used to explore any argument or idea you want to present to a group of people—an investment, a potential acquisition, a new product or feature, a monthly or quarterly business update, an operating plan, or even an idea on how to improve the food at the company cafeteria.”
			- > As analysis becomes more causal, multivariate, comparative, evidence based, and resolution-intense the more damaging the bullet list becomes."
			- Projects that are complex, interconnected, requiring plenty of information to explore, with greater and greater consequences connected to decisions are ill served by Power Point Presentations. Such analysis is not well served by a linear progression of slides that makes it difficult to refer one idea to another, sparsely worded bits of text don't fully express an idea, and visuals are more distracting than enlightening.

				  id:: 4a148da5-f510-491f-8930-28f9d8f6ee7b
				- For serious presentations it will be useful to replace PowerPoint slides with paper handouts showing words, numbers, data graphics, images together. High-resolution handouts allow viewers to contextualize, compare, narrate, and recast evidence. In contrast, data-thin, forgetful displays tend to make audiences ignorant and passive, and also to diminish the credibility of the presenter.
				  id:: ef2c9b04-b0d6-4cb3-8afa-d83300ba189f
			- Advantages for the readers
			  collapsed:: true
				- A narrative delivers much more information in a much shorter time. Decision makers can consume much more information in a given period of time.
				- Narratives also allow for nonlinear, interconnected arguments to unfold naturally—something that rigid PowerPoints do not permit. And interconnectedness defines many of our organization's processes.
				- Narratives allow for people to be more informed to make high quality decision, and can deliver better, more detailed feedback on the presenting teams' tactical and strategic plans.
			- Advantages to the presenters
			  collapsed:: true
				- The act of writing will force the writer to think and synthesize more deeply than they would crafting a PowerPoint slide. The ideas on paper will be better thought out, especially when the entire team has reviewed it and offered feedback.
				  id:: 15b3fa2c-b12c-4705-bcd5-7f9c60d8073a
				- Narrative ensure that ideas are carefully weighed and thoroughly analyzed before they're shared. #presentation #[[Decision Making]]
				- A complete narrative should also anticipate the likely objections, concerns, and alternative points of view. Writers should anticipate smart questions, reasonable objections, even common misunderstandings—and to address them proactively in their narrative document. We should think deeply and correctly about our opportunities.
				- Successful narratives will connect the dots for the reader and create a persuasive argument, instead of presenting disconnected stream of bullet points and graphics that leaves the audience to do all the work.
					- Writing persuasively requires and enforces clarity of thought to benefit the multiple teams collaborating on an idea.
				- A PowerPoint presentation doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad presentation if the presenter can walk the audience through completely and simply through their thought patterns in the decision making process.^^ However voice tracking requires more work for the audience to connect the dots of their own thinking and can allow them to turn off their thoughts and automatically follow our suggestions. While this may feel good, it robs the presenter of counter ideas and points of view that may help.^^
			- When consuming information presented to you, assume the sentence or information you're consuming is wrong until  you can prove otherwise. #[[Critical Thinking]] #[[mental models]]

	- Chapter 5 - Working Backwards: Start with the Desired Customer Experience
	  id:: 62dc5ca8-e105-4c75-84db-c3f8e49b93a0
		- Working backward is to start by defining the customer experience, then iteratively work backward from that point until the team achieves clarity of thought around what to build.
		- Working backward can start from FAQ (internal and external), manuals and press releases, and mockups of the products. 
		  id:: 4eaff71b-df90-42a8-8da8-4d98cb92c07b
			- Half-baked mock-ups were no better, perhaps worse, than no mock-ups at all. Half-baked mock-ups were evidence of half-baked thinking. There needs to be a thorough analysis of plans.
		- The features and benefits of the PR/FAQ #[[PR FAQ]]
		  id:: 62dc5ca8-554f-48d9-ad95-cbcb35d058c5
			- The primary point  of the process is to shift from an internal/company perspective to a customer perspective.
			- Multiple FAQs/PRs are drafted to reiterate and refine ideas. The PR is a few paragraphs, always less than one page. The frequently asked questions should be five pages or less.
			- Press Release components
				- Heading: Name the product in a way the reader will understand
				- Subheading: Describe the customer for the product and what benefits they will gain from using it. One sentence only underneath the heading
				- summary paragraph: Give a summary of the product and the benefit
				- Problem paragraph: Describe the problem that your product is designed to solve. Make sure that you write this paragraph from the customer's point of view.
				- Solution paragraph: Describe your product in some detail and how it simply and easily solves the customer's problem. For more complex products =, you may need more than one paragraph.
			- FAQ
				- In the FAQ consider the dependencies of your solution
				- Consider the feasibility of your solution
	- Chapter 6 - Metrics Manage Your Inputs, Not Your Outputs #[[vanity metrics]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Often companies pay attention to the wrong signals or lack the ability to see into key business trends, even when they are swimming in data.
		- Amazon chooses input (leading) metrics which are the drivers, when managed well, leads to profitable growth. 
		  id:: 975b6b07-c2bd-47f3-9e8a-2c06d58e7f83
		- > Before you can improve any system...you must understand how the inputs affect the outputs of the system. You must be able to change the inputs (and possibly the system) in order to achieve the desired results. This will require sustained effort, constancy of purpose, and an environment where continual improvement is the operating philosophy.
		- Amazon conducts a weekly business review implementing the Six Sigma method DMAIC - define measure analyze improve control
			- First, define and select the metrics you want to measure. The right choice of metrics will deliver clear, actionable guidance.
			- Leading or input metrics track things like selection, price or convenience—things that you can control through actions such as adding items to the catalog, lowering costs so you can lower prices or positioning inventory to facilitate faster delivery to customers. 
			  id:: 531316e4-6ab1-4060-9e42-30c0f134dca1
				- Input metrics when done correctly, will positively affect the output (lagging) metrics.
			- Output metrics like orders, revenue, and profit are important but they generally can't be directly manipulated in a sustainable manner over the long term.
		- **The flywheel: Input Metrics Lead to Output Metrics and Back again**
			- Input metrics drives output metrics. As you inject energy into any one element, or all of them, the flywheel spins faster.
				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FlZdsgamATd.png?alt=media&token=2c02690c-fdab-450b-8d1d-2784e24c3ec9)
		- **Identify the Correct Controllable Input Metrics**
			- Make sure to ask yourself if you work to change the selected metric if it will result in changing the desired output?
			- Start with your customers and work backwards by aligning your metrics with the customer experience.
		- **Analyze**
			- Develop a comprehensive understanding of what drives your metrics. Until you know all the external factors that impact the process, it will be difficult to implement positive changes.
				- Employ [[The Five Whys]] to determine external factors when encountering an anomaly and correcting errors (ex. Why is the application fast on Mondays but slow in Fridays)
				- > When you encounter a problem, the probability you're actually looking at the actual root cause of the problem in the initial hours is pretty close to zero, because it turns out that behind every issue there's a very interesting story.
					- If you identify the correct true root cause of variation through the five whys and  eliminate them, you'll have a predictable, in-control process you can optimize
		- **Improve**
			- The improvement process only comes after developing a solid understanding of our work processes (with the aid of metrics) to prevent responding to noise (imperfect information) but instead act on real signals. For example, we can ask ourselves how to go from 95% to 98% if we can constantly hit 95%.
		- **Control**
			- The control stage is concerned about operating our processes with little variances. At this stage we can start looking at automation, such as automating forecasting and purchasing decisions.
		- The WBR: Metrics at Work
			- The weekly review meeting looks at the progress updates of organization through the lens of metrics.
			- The Deck
				- The deck is a virtual or printed distribution of the data package containing weekly snapshots of graphs, tables, and occasional notes for all your metrics.
				- __The deck represents a data-driven end-to-end view of the business__
				- __It's mostly charts, graphs, and data tables__
				- __The metrics improve over time and evaluated for usefulness__
				- __Graphs  plot results against comparable prior periods__
				- __Graphs show two or more timelines, for example, trailing 6-week and trailing 12 month__
				- __Anecdotes and exception reporting are woven into the deck__
			- Running the Meeting
				- A well-run WBR meeting is defined by intense customer focus, deep dives into complex challenges, and insistence on high standards and operational excellence.
				- The goal of the meeting is to discuss exceptions and what is being done about them. The status quo needs no elaboration [[Q - How to run a meeting]]
			- Output Metrics Show Results. Input Metrics Provide Guidance
				- Output metrics are far poorer indicators of trend causes than input metrics. ex. Revenue vs new customer acquisition

		- #Leadership #Experimentation #[[Problem Solving]]
			- The path to success was riddled with setbacks, hard lessons, false starts, and painful failures. But the organization didn't expect anything different.
			- When starting to solve a large problem focus on who and how to solve that problem rather than quickly jumping and directly attacking the problem
			- The Digital Division at Amazon was created from scratch away from the Physical Media Division to allow single-threaded leadership. This was to promote utmost attention to developing digital media correctly without competing attention from already existing businesses.
		- The approach to digital media was for invention rather than become a fast follower (copycat) because the digital landscape was changing too quickly. By the time Amazon copied something, if they were to choose a fast follower strategy, the copy may already be obsolete.
		- Outsourcing was also discouraged because it limited innovation and the pace for rapid improvement if the contractors limited the choices for improvements to their own internal teams. Outsourcing is a short-term decision that is consequential for long-term consequences.
	- Chapter 8 - Prime
	  collapsed:: true
		- Prime came out a choice to skate to where the puck is instead of wait and see improvement in Amazon's fulfillment centers. They knew that two-day and same-day shipping would be the norm and pursued that direction over small iterative improvements.
		- ((9553bf30-c3df-474b-afe0-a495be8647f3))
		- The institutional no is when the organization says no to doing something. Staying the course is comfortable and offers certainty for leadership—even if the price of the short-term certainty is instability and value destruction long-term.
			- Most institution don't have the tools to evaluate the cost of not doing something.
	- Chapter 9 - Amazon Unbox
	  collapsed:: true
		- Employees have an obligation to learn from our mistakes and help others not make the same mistake. Share what we learned by clearly documenting where we went wrong with others in the organization. #[[Learning Culture]]
	- Chapter 10 - AWS
	  collapsed:: true
		- Amazon was able to pioneer web services, a field they had no expertise in, through their culture of innovation and experimentation. They fostered exploration of new ideas and had the long-term mindset to allow seeds to grow and flourish, even if the initial growth was slow. Amazon had the ability to see potential in something small.
		- Amazon had attended a software developer conference where they noted that Flickr was busy scaling their storage, servers, and software and bemoaned that fact they weren't spending as much time as they wanted on innovation. Amazon saw the opportunity to take on this lifting for software companies to offer AWS.
		- The launch of AWS relied on several Amazon leadership principles to apply their Customer Obsession principle

	- Conclusion
	  collapsed:: true
		- Amazon does not shame its workers. Failure is understood as a group process. For Amazon failure is an experiment for which a great deal of information can be learned that can lead to change and improvement. Very often, failure is temporary and eventually gives birth to success.
		- Articulate the core elements of the company's culture and then build them into every process and discussion.
		- Depict your flywheel. What are the driver of growth for your company? Make a picture of them that shows how they act upon the flywheel. Evaluate everything you do in light of its positive or negative effect on one or more drivers of the flywheel.
