	- On vacation in Mexico, Miranda visited a bookstore and randomly chose Ron Chernow’s biography of the American Revolutionary War hero Alexander Hamilton. Miranda was “thunderstruck.” He imagined a direct line between Hamilton writing his way off the island of St. Croix and the pioneers of rap music writing their way out of poverty.
	  
	  • Miranda chose to write his famous musical Hamilton as hip-hop because it’s the language of ambition, defiance, and rebellion. It has the most words per measure of any musical genre, which makes it uniquely suited to reflect the density of Hamilton’s writing.
	  
	  • America’s Founding Fathers were white men, but Miranda deliberately cast black and Latino actors to play them. Hamilton is the story of America then told by people who live in America now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpyz60xxm1s9srsqsnazpdx6))

	- In the twenty-first century knowledge economy, you are only as valuable as your ideas. The ability to convince others that your ideas matter is the single greatest skill that will give you a competitive edge at a time when the combined forces of globalization, automation, and artificial intelligence trigger a wave of anxiety across every profession in every country. In the next decade, your ideas—and the ability to articulate those ideas successfully—will count more than ever. Persuaders are irreplaceable.

	- Machines learn from crunching large amounts of existing data while we humans use our imaginations to propose and communicate novel ideas that, by definition, have never been seen before. “We can connect seemingly disparate threads to solve problems,” says Goldbloom.[6](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/26202618#notes-fm4-6) “This puts a fundamental limit on the human tasks that machines will automate.” If a computer can recognize average, it can replicate average. Average simply isn’t good enough to stand out in the digital age. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtazwthk6atxwskpfd47gm9p))

	- People who know how to talk—and talk well—will be rewarded, and those with the ability to inspire people—to ignite another person’s imagination—will be especially well positioned. “Machines can learn to read human emotion, but they don’t have human emotions. It’s a very important distinction,” says Jacobstein ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb00ydz3g1815mr25r53kxc))
	- Company leaders across the board say it’s difficult to find applicants who can communicate clearly and precisely, inspiring and engaging co-workers and customers. “These traits can make the difference between a standout employee and one who just gets by,” according to The Wall Street Journal.[11](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/26202618#notes-fm4-11) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb01n66p3bb5p03m8gdgv2n))
	- If you have the ability to communicate ideas that grab people’s attention, then you won’t be replaced anytime soon,” says data expert Anthony Goldbloom.[15](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/26202618#notes-fm4-15) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb02wcs7b8qvarrr6xn6vw4))
	- The unusual person will jump out,” says billionaire Warren Buffett.[16](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/26202618#notes-fm4-16) “And it’s not because they have an IQ of 200 or anything like that. You will jump out, much more than you can anticipate, if you get really comfortable with public speaking. It’s an asset that will last you 50 or 60 years and it’s a liability if you don’t like doing it.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb03bec9s809pxtwh7121a7))

	- Carton identified the rhetorical formula behind Kennedy’s successful communication and explained how his speaking skills triggered massive action.
	  
	  First, “Kennedy reduced the number of NASA’s aspirations to one.”[4](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/26202618#notes-ch1-4) When NASA was established in 1958, it had several objectives, among them to establish superior space technology, to achieve preeminence in space, and to advance science. Kennedy chose to focus on the single goal of sending humans to the moon and returning them safely to Earth. It’s easier to rally a team around one common goal than to divide their attention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb2ga1vsqabnzqwjp81ydrj))
	- Second, “Kennedy shifted attention from NASA’s ultimate aspiration to a concrete objective.” In other words, Kennedy took the abstract (advancing science by exploring the solar system) and made it tangible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb2gzhjrya9bwqkzermf13w))
	- Third, “Kennedy communicated milestones that connected employees’ day-to-day work with concrete objectives.” Kennedy outlined three programs and three objectives: The Mercury program would send an astronaut into orbit; Gemini would teach NASA what it didn’t know about space walks and connecting two spacecrafts together; and Apollo would ultimately put a man on the moon. As you’ll learn later, the “rule of three” is a powerful communication technique that superstar persuaders use to mobilize their listeners. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb2jr7g8kg6g0q7w1xxy6p0))
	- Fourth, “Kennedy emphasized the impressive scale of the objective with metaphors, analogies and unique figures of speech.” Kennedy relied on a rarely used technique that linguists call “embodied concept.” It binds a concrete event (landing on the moon) with an abstract aspiration (advancing science). The abstract and concrete become one and the same. For example, in a speech at Rice University in 1962, Kennedy said, “Space is there and we’re going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there.” Kennedy gave abstract ideals like knowledge, peace, and exploration a real location ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb2nebzsqjqyd3k22q4g9bg))
	- The four steps proved to be irresistibly persuasive. Kennedy’s “soft” skill led to one of the greatest achievements in the history of humanity. His words gave NASA employees a stronger connection between their work and the ultimate goal. They no longer saw their work as an isolated series of tasks like mopping the floors or building electrical circuits. Instead, they viewed their work as a critical component of putting a man on the moon, advancing science, and changing the world as we know it. “In this way, Kennedy positioned employees to experience greater meaningfulness from their work by changing the meaning of work,” says Carton. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb2nk5j6f03n97bqm7aekx9))
	- In the early 1960s, skeptics outnumbered those who believed a person could set foot on the moon by the end of the decade. Kennedy didn’t persuade people with facts alone; he made them feel. He combined what Aristotle called Pathos and Logos: emotion and logic. Kennedy’s words achieved emotional transcendence, making people believe that the impossible was possible. Skeptics became believers and believers became evangelists. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb2p8xqgexh21p3j5fr7978))
	- Great leaders combine great ideas and the ability to communicate those ideas effectively. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb38fvt5za397p47c5kyeab))
	- These days, you can’t lead without inspired followers.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb39gfantjsyqychy3aw9qy))
	- Our riches did not come from piling brick on brick, or bachelor’s degree on bachelor’s degree, or bank balance on bank balance, but from piling idea on idea ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb42rbfa0beq85kw2t429we))
	- Ideas cannot build upon one another without advocates to argue for them and evangelists to spread them. In a world built on ideas, the persuaders—the ones who can win hearts and change minds—have a competitive edge ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb433k8ekefbqqr8jkpqqq2))
	- As automation continues to replace the labor we once did by hand, persuasion as a share of national income is only getting larger. McCloskey expects sweet talk to make up 40 percent of America’s labor income in the next 20 years ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb515t3wgxfvypz2797pr67))
	- Storytelling is a powerful way to get our clients to think differently,” Kaushik said. “If we can show people how to unlock data to make money, grow a business, or make them more successful, we’ll have made a heart-and-mind connection that drives action.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb4c936ejv7rw4pzc7bby9n))
	- Where most salespeople and marketers are proud to deliver “insights,” Kaushik prefers “out-of-sights.” An insight, by definition, is in sight of the audience. It’s information that the listener already knows. For example, it would not be a groundbreaking revelation if Kaushik were to tell retailers that fewer people are seeing their ads in print newspapers these days. However, showing them that 70 percent of in-store purchases are influenced by what their shoppers see and read on mobile devices might fundamentally change how those retailers run their businesses. A “Googler” is taught to always open presentations with an out-of-sight, a big, transformative idea that radically alters a customer’s perspective. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb4drqx12dapbbgc9ss1xgg))
	- Aristotle defined rhetoric as the art of using written and oral language to persuade people to better their lives. Aristotle believed that success in a civilized society required both wisdom and eloquence. And eloquence, he argued, came down to a system, a formula for reaching hearts and changing minds. Aristotle’s techniques form the bedrock of public speaking today. Every inspiring speech, PowerPoint presentation, or pep talk has—at its core—the strategy Aristotle introduced more than 2,000 years ago ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb4gsm46dhb6x3kw0mavm39))
	- The theme of your argument is what you want the other person to do: An entrepreneur’s theme might be that a venture capitalist should invest in an idea, a manager’s theme might be that a team should give priority to one product line over another, and a salesperson’s theme might be that customers should adopt a new service. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb4hmbgw2xhzy26gdw6kth9))
	- A theme gives an argument its direction and sets the goal of a conversation, but it’s Aristotle’s second step that gives an appeal its persuasive power. A speaker must back up the argument using three rhetorical proofs: logic, credibility, and emotion. Persuasion requires that my argument follow a logical structure (Logos). It requires that you trust me based on my character and credibility (Ethos). And it requires that I make an emotional connection with you (Pathos) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb4j43hc4nk8z8rb83xx3aj))
	- Logical reasoning is critical, but it is only one-third of the formula. Persuasion cannot occur in the absence of Ethos and Pathos. Ethos refers to the credibility of the speaker. Aristotle believed that audiences found a speaker to be trustworthy if the speaker had three characteristics: wisdom, virtue, and goodwill. If a speaker was prepared with a well-structured argument, they would be seen as wise. If a speaker was seen as a moral and virtuous person, they would be considered reliable and credible. Very importantly, a speaker who clearly wanted what was best for the audience was seen as a person of goodwill. A “snake oil salesman” conjures up the least trustworthy kind of person because peddlers in snake oil only want to separate you from your money. They don’t have your best interest at heart; only theirs. They are considered unethical because they don’t have Ethos. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb4jsn6hfxr85zs0apwwmfm))
	- Aristotle’s work is considered the first real discussion of human psychology because Pathos—emotion—makes up such a sizable portion of his formula. In the absence of emotion nothing else matters, according to Aristotle. In fact, he saw lack of emotion as a serious personality defect. After all, when you see an injustice carried out, it’s natural to feel angry. When you experience the death of a parent, it’s natural to grieve. Aristotle believed emotion should guide our decisions, as long as the emotion we experience is the appropriate one ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb53n6kw2p86p6hpy5wrgzp))
	- Today’s best trial lawyers have learned from Jefferson’s rhetoric that persuasion isn’t simply a recitation of facts. Persuasion requires connecting words to a broader theme that inspires people to embrace a big, bold vision, much like Kennedy did when he inspired people to reach for the moon ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb5563g1wwvngc7cvkvqddm))
	- As humans we are wired to seek emotional connections with one another ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb5656d2714d4hrxtc6ckbw))
	- How do we compete? How do we remain relevant? How do we flourish and thrive? Of course we all need to be experts at our jobs and flexible enough to adapt to this fast-changing landscape. But that is not enough. The answer is in persuasion and, more specifically, Pathos. Facts alone don’t spark movements; emotions do. Facts don’t inspire people to look to the stars; emotions do. Facts don’t excite; emotions do. Facts don’t encourage people to seek out innovative solutions to challenging problems; emotions do. Pathos—emotion—is the key to winning the future. And now science proves it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb56tj6b3hzr9reawnx88g8))
	- Emotion Is the Fastest Path to the Brain ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtb576t7nkd47aqtb4cdxjpg))
	- researchers conclude that in the age of automation, emotion is more important than ever to sustain a successful career. The research finds that highly skilled workers command higher incomes because of three capabilities: ability to perform rote tasks quickly, their experience in evaluating data to determine a course of action, and their savviness in helping clients navigate the course. “AI and machine learning will quickly surpass our abilities on the first two capabilities,” according to the research.[8](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/26202618#notes-ch3-8) “Those who want to stay relevant in their professions will need to focus on skills and capabilities that artificial intelligence has trouble replicating—understanding, motivating, and interacting with human beings.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtcngtzrytnv5ktmdect97gm))
	- Military leaders who deliver clear and persuasive mission briefs—the who, what, when, where, why, and how of a combat operation—are often elevated to higher positions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtcns51hfck6c60b2akg0ysg))
	- Anytime you try to sell something to somebody, you’re selling a dream. You’re asking them to become part of your story,” Geoff Ralston says ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtdche86paj0208hqzhnvgd5))
	- Storytelling isn’t a soft skill; storytelling is fundamental,” Ralston told me. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtdcj96nyfsv08z30mwxwxyn))
	- Successful companies and entrepreneurs create a narrative around their products, services, and brand. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtdcjx0vh1ebppay5c0yqg47))
	- An inspiring leader who articulates an intoxicating mission will have an easier time hiring the best and the brightest. Without such a leader, Altman says, “I usually get bored.” Great communicators don’t put people to sleep.
	  
	  After backing more than 3,200 founders, Altman has arrived at a series of questions he asks himself about the opportunity[7](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/26202618#notes-ch4-7):
	  
	  • Will the company build something lots of people LOVE?
	  
	  • Will the company be easy to copy?
	  
	  • Are the founders “forces of nature”?
	  
	  • Does the company have a clear and important mission ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtdcnxvpwnz34fkav3r39h9w))
	- The analysts failed to predict Apple’s success because they were crunching numbers instead of considering experiences. The critics were correct that—compared to its peers—Apple stores would have to generate more money to pay for their expensive spaces in shopping malls. What they didn’t realize was that Steve Jobs and his team didn’t set out to sell computers. Instead they planned to introduce customers to tools that would unleash their personal creativity. They knew that if they could make emotional connections, sales would follow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtdcqvv4fxzm1ajd5276tqc0))
	- Brands that care have a healthy culture. They outperform their peers on customer satisfaction scores and enjoy higher rates of growth, revenue, and profits. Culture drives success at the world’s most admired companies: Apple, Google, Virgin, Microsoft, Southwest, Starbucks, Zappos, and many others. Inspiring leadership is critical to each of these brands. They were founded or are currently run by men and women who believe that technology alone is not enough. They see their role as fostering community and creating experiences. Ahrendts once said that human energy has the power to unite people, build companies, and transform lives. Great leaders are great at unleashing human energy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtdd2qcn97t85p78kghfz7vg))
	- The ratings are based on data from the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey (HCAHPS). The survey is comprised of 32 questions filled out by some 8,700 patients a day. At least one-third of the questions cover communication skills. For example:
	  
	  • During your hospital stay, how often did doctors or nurses explain things in a way you could understand?
	  
	  • During this hospital stay, did doctors, nurses, or other hospital staff talk with you about whether you would have the help you needed when you left the hospital?
	  
	  • Before giving you any new medicine, how often did hospital staff tell you what the medicine was for?[13](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/26202618#notes-ch4-13) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtdd5jvcs93zmsadc9d3nrxb))
		- **Note**: How can we apply these questions in development processes.
	- More than 70 percent of negative HCAHPS scores are directly related to a breakdown in communication. This is a serious problem. Poor communication leads to decreased revenue for healthcare systems and more health problems for patients. Effective communication is directly correlated to better health outcomes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtdd9ycp86v467nmbwfrs00h))
	- Leaders at the Cleveland Clinic realized that communication skills—like any other skill—improved with practice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtddbrjgz3ewtn6ge6k43nmm))
	- The data analyst uncovered a trend that hospital leaders are beginning to learn and that the world’s leading hotel owners have known a long time—human communication builds emotional connections, and emotion is the secret to earning the coveted fifth star ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtddh7snxfth2kefjp09wv0g))
	- Four-star hotels deliver a high level of service and quality. The mattresses are comfortable, the linens are soft, and the service is “professional.” The staffs at five-star hotels are different. They push the boundaries of the guest experience. They are caring, gracious, and thoughtful. They show a genuine interest in their guests. They anticipate a guest’s needs. They surprise and delight. Service differentiates four-star from five-star hotels and stand-out service requires emotional resonance ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtddp5jct968m2619zkv3zep))
	- The Sanctuary Hotel on South Carolina’s Kiawah Island is 1 of only 154 hotels in the world to earn a Forbes five-star rating. The resort hires and trains employees to make emotional connections with each and every guest in each and every interaction. Employees are taught to:
	  
	  Get the customer’s name right. A name personalizes the interaction. Employees are trained in using memory tricks to remember those names. A customer is not a room number. A customer is “Mr. and Mrs. Johnson and their four-year-old daughter, Veronica.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtddpqkxd1ps8van9yrnr47r))
	- Anticipate needs. Employees are trained to recognize guests’ needs before they realize those needs themselves ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtddr1gjfj66rdqvvg3z0xkf))
	- There are many topics Tyson avoids. It’s part of the key, he says, to making science fun. Instead of powering his way through the whole syllabus, so to speak, Tyson cherry-picks “the cool stuff” to make science accessible and to hook the audience into wanting to learn more. “There are many topics I don’t come near, because I have yet to find a way to make them fully (or even partially) accessible,” he says. For example, “Topics like spectroscopic analysis, interferometry, or Einstein’s special theory of relativity. You can ask me about them. But after my attempt to explain it to you, if you look back at me confused, we will need to sit down with pen and paper.”[6](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/26202618#notes-ch5-6) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtdg8nhvvrztgsrzsybe5seb))
	- The secret to communicating science and other complex topics is not to “translate” the content—which Tyson says only serves to oversimplify and dumb it down—but to “explain with enthusiasm and, where and when necessary, link the concept to something embedded in pop culture, where we all have active receptors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtdg918309nrbbcv130wq5py))
	- Research has shown that delivering too much information at once results in “cognitive backlog,” which simply means our short-term memory bank gets full, fast. The TED conference has found that 18 minutes is just the right amount of time to have a substantive discussion without putting your listeners to sleep. NASA sticks to the same 18-minute principle.
