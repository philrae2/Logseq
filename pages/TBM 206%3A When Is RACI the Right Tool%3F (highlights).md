	- RACI might be a good tool if you are experiencing one or more of the following dynamics ***and*** **you lack the time (or support) to address these issues in other ways**:
	  
	  •   People working in a workgroup, not a team
	    
	  •   People working together on a temporary/ad-hoc basis
	    
	  •   New or inexperienced team members (without norms or role models, see below)
	    
	  •   Acquisition, newly formed team, clash of work styles
	    
	  •   Frequent changes in team membership
	    
	  •   Forming a stable cross-functional team is difficult (some team members are not full-time, established specialist teams, etc.)
	    
	  •   Not worth investing in team resilience (temporary team, etc.)
	    
	  •   Large projects with lots of constraints and dependencies
	    
	  •   Risk of "negative externalities." Team 1's work can negatively impact Team 2
	    
	  •   Low trust or low psychological safety
	    
	  •   Communication difficulties
	    
	  •   "Superficial collaboration" or "token collaboration"
	    
	  •   In situations without an established set of norms or collaboration culture
	    
	  •   Lack of "role models" (individuals modeling effective collaboration)
	    
	  •   Informal conflict resolution is challenging (e.g., unsafe or unsuccessful)
	    
	  •   Incentives not aligned
	    
	  •   Unclear team mandates and areas of ownership
	    
	  •   Leaders are misaligned, putting pressure on groups/individuals to resolve misalignment.
