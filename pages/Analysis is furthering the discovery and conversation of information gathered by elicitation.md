- **Note:**
	 - Question and analyze the information we gain from the elicitation process. Don't simply take face value the information that your stakeholders give you.

	 - Think creatively about the gathered information through models, deeper conversation and asking insightful questions.

	 - Organize the data first, perform your analysis to help you further future analyses.
