title: ðŸ§° Chapter 5 | The Heart of Project Management: The WBS
---

- > - Getting a project done means getting the work listed in the WBS done.
- Create the WBS using your notes from experience, from interviews and from documentation
- Program your attention in proportion to importance of work packages[*](((7b6bfb5f-9731-44ed-bd5d-1f78d95db980)))

- The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is the most important project management tool in this rBook. A project is essentially a collection of work that brings an idea to reality. The WBS documents this collection of work. Project management is ultimately about getting this list of work done.
	 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamfu%2FceLDjul6z0.png?alt=media&token=936e3e7d-11e5-49ea-8326-39e210b4e493)

- The WBS is a structured to-do list for the project. Prior to Roam, I used mind-mapping software to create work breakdown structures. The tips of the branches are called **work packages**. Work packages are the tasks you distribute to your project team.

	 - Here are some advantages of using Roam over mindmaps for your WBS:
		 - Trace where a work package came from (eg, blocked referenced from interview notes)

		 - Tag work packages to enable queries and filters based on task owners, priority levels, etc.

		 - "Zoom in" a work package by making it a page

- Let's look at a few examples. 
id:: 7b6bfb5f-9731-44ed-bd5d-1f78d95db980
	 - First, a simple theoretical example:
		 - Birthday party WBS
			 - Food
				 - Menu
					 - Survey on allergies and food preferences

					 - Create menu

				 - Buy groceries

				 - Do the cooking

				 - Set the table

			 - Invitations
				 - Make a list of people to invite

				 - Create the invitations

				 - Send the invitations

			 - Setup
				 - Buy decorations

				 - Decorate the house

			 - Cleanup
				 - Remove decorations

	 - An actual project will have a larger WBS. When I was working in a university, I was asked to organize a conference for a renowned professor. Here is its WBS. I keep my old work breakdown structures, so I don't start from scratch when I do similar projects in the future.

		 - To translate this into action, I have been running a non-profit outreach that works with student governments to provide project management training to university students[*](www.univcebu.com). Here's the color-coded WBS I share with the organizers when we plan out the training. The yellow work packages are the ones owned by the organizing student government. I did the WBS work once, with minor additions from lessons learned in each execution.

- The best way to learn the WBS and all the other tools in the rBook is to apply them to a real project of yours. Let's recall your answer in the ((c80446a4-b76f-4508-9ae6-92a4e261adfd)) section in [[ðŸ§­ Chapter 2 | When To Use (And Not Use) These Project Management Tools]]

		 - What are the tasks that need to be done to complete this project? Creating your WBS entails listing down these tasks and categorizing them.
			 - You can do the WBS bottom-up or top-down. You could start by listing all the things needed to be done, then categorizing them. Or you could imagine the categories of work needed to deliver the project then fill them in with todos.

			 - The WBS could be many levels deep, with many work categories and subcategories. The structure is up to you. One key principle is that the work packages are the size you want for tracking. What looks like a task you could assign and follow up? Ultimately, this is based on your preference.

			 - Our main objective at this point is scope identification: what needs to be done to complete the project?
				 - Identifying dependencies, and scheduling tasks and assigning them will come later.

	 - [[Maximize your learning]]
		 - Create a WBS for your chosen project.

- Create the WBS using your notes from experience, from interviews and from documentation
	 - After your first stab at your project's WBS, you might notice that you have gaps in your knowledge of what needs to be done to bring this project to reality. This is more likely the more technical your project is. Creating a WBS by yourself is also helpful when it is your first time managing a certain kind of project. It gives you an idea of what you don't know.
		 - Here are some common ways of closing the gaps of your knowledge:
			 - Interview people who have experience with this kind of project
id:: 78c107d6-64f1-4f66-abe4-c2dbfa27ce88

			 - Study the documents of project managers who have led a similar project in the past
id:: 6ce842ba-1aba-47e8-a26c-e9fe2f7d8317

			 - Read blog posts or papers that talk about a similar project
id:: 7efe6700-4772-445c-9561-010083a39d1e

			 - Organize a workshop with your team

					 - __Working with local teams in pre-pandemic times. There are many apps that try to replicate this online. What I prefer to do is have 1:1 Zoom meetings where I share my WBS in Roam and build it along with the teammate I'm meeting.__

	 - Here's an actual example. This is a sub-project under [[Project Accessible Genomics]]. We did a crowdfunding campaign. Here's a screenshot of the WBS along with some sources of inputs. You can view [the actual WBS here]([[[[P: RESOLVED Crowdfunding]] WBS]]).
		 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamfu%2FpTvzaviKc0.png?alt=media&token=05781a76-d8a8-4409-963b-e4db2e3d1f1b)
			 - This was my first time to do a crowdfunding campaign. I built the WBS from my notes from some readings and a couple of interviews. I imported those notes from my main graph: [[Imported notes on crowdfunding]].

- Program your attention in proportion to importance of work packages
	 - Next, let's put some tags on our WBS. This will help us prepare for the next project management tools in this rBook and help us program our attention. It is up to you at what level you wish to tag your WBS.
		 - What work packages are your [80/20](((59413c67-dfee-4131-b450-b8f65e982482)))? (The few tasks with the biggest impact on the outcome of the project)
id:: a289026e-4a3c-466f-9170-3414a06e86a8

		 - What work packages require the most money?
id:: 04a290c5-248c-42b2-a9fa-16e062ac5299

		 - What work packages require the most time from you?
id:: d8aa0fbe-9b5b-4b47-b128-780e7bb4504f

		 - What work packages are most exposed to risks?
id:: 451ac588-76a5-482b-bf7c-6de24973b63b

		 - What work packages require some special skills you need to hire out?
id:: 732632d7-bd94-42ad-8ab5-37cf20cdc94f

	 - Here is an example: the [WBS of the crowdfunding project]([[[[P: RESOLVED Crowdfunding]] WBS]]), with tags at the top level.
		 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamfu%2FKpYmgw9LpB.png?alt=media&token=6d4419fc-082e-4481-9d38-3e77413e3087)
			 - __I'm using the tags #risk and #time to indicate which branches are the riskiest or requires the most time.__ 

			 - __Not all branch tips in this WBS are work packages. Some are notes on work packages. This was done before the comment function came out. I now use comments for those notes, so that all branch tips are work packages.__

	 - [[Maximize your learning]]
		 - Tag your WBS branches with the following:
			 - ((a289026e-4a3c-466f-9170-3414a06e86a8))

			 - ((04a290c5-248c-42b2-a9fa-16e062ac5299))

			 - ((d8aa0fbe-9b5b-4b47-b128-780e7bb4504f))

			 - ((451ac588-76a5-482b-bf7c-6de24973b63b))

	 - Find the optimal investment required to get the project done well
		 - As a project manager, you invest time, attention, emotional reserves, and possibly money into a project. The return on investment (ROI) is the quality of your project, which should ultimately produce some good: getting paid, growth, impact.
			 - At some point, an increase in investment does not yield a proportional increase in ROI. You reach a point of diminishing returns.
				 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamfu%2Fds23GVf4i_.png?alt=media&token=e62aa9c2-6e44-45ef-8aca-c6346db4638e)

			 - As a rule, you don't give 100% to a project. These are the only exceptions I could think of:
				 - When lives are on the line

				 - Project failure will ruin you

				 - You are playing a high-stakes winner-take-all/most game

				 - You are going all in as a way to grow 

		 - The Pareto Principle also applies to project management. 20% of your efforts yields 80% of the value in the project. 
id:: 59413c67-dfee-4131-b450-b8f65e982482
			 - Both good and bad fortune are probabilistic. Project outcomes are never certain. This means you'd want a portfolio of projects rather than betting everything on one project. To use math allegorically, you'd want to bet 20% on 5 projects, aiming for 70%-90% quality, rather than bet 100% on 1 project, aiming for 100% quality. The latter does not exist.
				 - We translate this principle into action in [[ðŸ§° Chapter 8 | How to Not Fail: The RBS and The Risk Register]] and [[ðŸ§° Chapter 9 | Designing Serendipity: How to Systematically Get Lucky]].

- During Project Execution
	 - You can also tag each work package with the teammate in charge of getting it done. During [1:1 meetings](((b769f0e9-3c42-4db8-ba7b-caf91a025d70))), you can filter or query by name, and you have a list of work packages to discuss with the teammate you are meeting. Status tags (eg, done/ongoing) could also be used as a filter. Date tags can also be used to focus on tasks for a time period.
		 - Using custom CSS, the tags can add color to the WBS. This gives you a visual feel of the completion of the project. For instance, your WBS could grow greener and greener as work packages are completed.

		 - Queries are demonstrated in [[ðŸ§° Chapter 8 | How to Not Fail: The RBS and The Risk Register]].

- ---

- > We have created version 1 of our WBS, and we have identified which work packages or branches have the biggest impact (80/20), are exposed to the biggest risks, require the most time or money, and require special skills. We now have a sense of the journey we need to undertake from idea to reality.

- > [[pro tip]]: what you learn in creating a WBS is more important than the actual WBS.

- ---

- [[Maximize your learning]]
	 - Work on your WBS.
		 - Grow it by adding branches based on your experience and your notes.

		 - Do what you need to do to make use of other people's knowledge to build your WBS.

		 - Make use of your knowledge and other people's knowledge to tag your WBS branches and work package, to get a better idea of where you should allot your attention.

- [[Next chapter]]
	 - Project managers orchestrate work across people and across time, to bring an idea to reality. How do we use the project charter to help us do this? We will learn this in the next chapter: [[ðŸ§° Chapter 6 | Aligning Your Stakeholders, Your Team and Your Future Selves: The Project Charter]]
