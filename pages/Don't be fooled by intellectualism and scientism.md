- **Note:**
	 - We need to consider that theory and practice go hand in hand. If the information from theorists are different from the doers, then it is best to believe the doers.

	 - If you're information is only from theory and academia, consider the decision high risk and uncertainty. Reduce the risk of uncertainty by also considering what those in practice have to say.
