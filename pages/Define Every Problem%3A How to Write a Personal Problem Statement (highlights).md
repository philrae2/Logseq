	- A problem statement can help bridge that gap. It‚Äôs a brief summary of a problem you want to address. It‚Äôs most commonly used in research to clearly identify the problem to be solved before taking action. However, it has many benefits that can be harnessed outside of a research context, and can be especially helpful to tackle personal problems.

	- In research, problem statements are [valued](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0740818894900035) because they crystallize the issue at hand, help researchers to avoid preconceived ideas, and ensure that each study has a clear direction before work begins.
	  
	  Researcher Max Kush [explains](https://asq.org/quality\-progress/articles/one\-good\-idea\-the\-statement\-problem?id=6c8443c9748e4ddabc1badc97cbb84ae) that problem statements should explore the gap between your current state and your future goal. The concise description should emphasize all of the facts that need to be addressed to move forwards.
	  
	  However, he goes on to [highlight](https://www.proquest.com/openview/29360a0320fffda8a1e6e1e1bc4bf479/1?cbl=34671&pq\-origsite=gscholar) that unfortunately, problem statements often incorrectly assume that everyone understands the issue, leading to weak, error\-laden or incomplete statements. Using a series of ‚Äòfive W‚Äô questions (who, where, what, when and why) that ensure a comprehensive understanding of the problem can help avoid that pitfall.

	- You will notice that the problem statement doesn‚Äôt include a ‚Äòhow‚Äô question. The statement can suggest options, but it doesn‚Äôt define the final answer. In a team setting, the problem statement is a tool for constructive conversation: it allows group members to discuss potential solutions together.

	- Problem statements are often helpful during [times of transition](https://nesslabs.com/liminal\-creativity). If you‚Äôre considering a [career change](https://nesslabs.com/career\-change), a problem statement will help you to fully understand the crux of any issues you might be facing now.

	- To write your problem statement, open your note\-taking app or start a fresh page in your notebook or journal before exploring the following questions:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   What is your ideal?
	  ‚Ä¢   What is your reality?
	  ‚Ä¢   What are the consequences of your current situation?
	  ‚Ä¢   What can you propose as improvements? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk0q1pkajb08dyjpj54f5sg2))
	- A personal problem statement might be: ‚ÄúI would like to read more books (ideal), but I spend two hours scrolling on social media everyday while commuting (reality), which impacts my mental health and my creativity (consequences). Instead, I should put my phone in my backpack and take my Kindle out as soon as I get on the bus in the morning (potential solution).‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk0q2w9a7s0ngb40m6ncx7kj))
	- If you‚Äôre struggling to articulate your answers to the above questions, you may in addition go through the series of ‚Äòfive W‚Äô questions (who, where, what, when and why) to get to the core of the problem at hand:
	  
	  ‚Ä¢   What is the problem? (the gap between ideal and reality)
	  ‚Ä¢   Who is experiencing the problem? (you, a friend, family member, colleague‚Ä¶)
	  ‚Ä¢   Where is the problem occuring? (at home, at school, at work‚Ä¶)
	  ‚Ä¢   When does the problem occur? (every day, week or month, during specific events, when around certain people‚Ä¶)
	  ‚Ä¢   Why does the problem occur? (gap in skills, knowledge, communication‚Ä¶) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk0q2q6vaxdttt6kxtvrj3sw))
