- Introduction
	 - The problems we solve today in knowledge-based organizations require approaches that necessitate the collaboration of workers across disciplines. For organizations to succeed not only do they have to solve these complex problems they must also [[learn]]. #[[problem solving]]
		 - Workers in organizations to solve these complex problems must be lifelong learners who master new skills are able to envision novel possibilities. Employees have to must absorb and sometimes create new knowledge while executing. Sometimes it isn't enough to apply our knowledge in our workplace to succeed, we need to create new connections, ideas, and rethink. #[[Lessons Learned]]

		 - Employees not only individually learn, but must also learn and apply knowledge collectively. This effort should be promoted and supported by their organization. For the organization to excel in a complex and uncertain business environment people need to both work and learn together.

		 - The top-down, and command-and-control approaches of organization, inhibit collaboration and organizational learning as leadership ensures control and limits variances. This results in organizational failures when confronting complex or dynamic problems, even though leadership or the organization is excellent.

	 - Effective Teaming for collaboration and learning
		 - For successful collaboration and teaming individuals need to be aware of others' needs, roles, and perspectives. This means decision-making is based on the integration of different perspectives. For this to happen we have to cultivate a culture of [[equal voice]] and establish a [[Psychological Safety]]

- Chapter 1 - A New Way of Working
	 - All good teams when in synergy, the whole is greater than its individuals. Organizations can succeed based on the strength of the learning culture they cultivate. 

	 - [[team]]s as a noun:
		 - Well-designed teams are those with clear goals, well-thought-out tasks that are conducive to teamwork, team members with the right skills and experiences for the task, adequate resources, and access to coaching and support. If a team is designed right then the quality of performance should take care of itself. This definition of a well-designed team is from psychologist [[Richard Hackman]]

		 - MIT professor [[Deborah Ancona]] showed that how much a team's members interact with people outside the team boundaries was also an important factor in team performance.

	 - [[team]]s as a verb
		 - Unlike the previous treatment of teams, teaming is a verb and when viewed in this light allows us to create synergy with dynamic team compositions. When viewed as verb teams become a fluid activity, not bound by designs and composition. It is determined by the mindset and practices of teamwork, not by bounded by the designs and structures of effective teams. It is teamwork on the fly. 

		 - Teaming as a verb is useful when teams quickly form and dissolve. Fast working environments need employees who know how to team. People need to develop and use new capabilities for sharing crucial knowledge quickly. They must learn to ask questions clearly and frequently. 

	 - Organizing to execute vs organizing to learn

		 - For knowledge work and software development does it make sense to measure baseline times and efficiency when the review itself maybe variable depending on the submission? What do we use the baseline numbers for? What kind of behaviors does seeking efficiency and optimization promote?
			 - __Devotion to efficiency and productivity results in two major workplace changes:__
				 - 1. Spurs a demand for professional managers who oversee vast complex work activity

				 - 2. Instills basic distrust of the worker

			 - When work is standardized and a general blanket of standard procedures is put in place, opportunities for creativity and discovery for new knowledge are limited. The managerial mindset that enables efficient execution also inhibits an organization's ability to learn and innovate. 
				 - GM is a historical example of a company who thrived on top-down management but became bankrupt after the company failed to evolve and innovate. 

				 - Evidence of productivity focus environments are a penchant for metrics and bottom lines. 
					 - Metrics do not work well when knowledge about how to produce a desired result is either still developing or is in a state of dramatic flux. 

			 - Fear of the supervisor also becomes a dominating tool (subconsciously) for worker performance.

		 - Top-down management was popularized in the industrial age when work became optimized and repetitive through assembly lines. When the work process is repetitive it makes sense for standardization and optimization. Assembly line work assumes that the work process is already optimized and there is little feedback needed from the workers. 
			 - Organizing to execute makes sense when production processes are well understood and can be reliably used. 

			 - Organizing to execute is all about driving out unnecessary variance, so that the process is as efficient as possibleâ€”wasting time as little employee time, material, and other valuable resources

			 - In organizations with knowledge work, the need to limit variability and mistakes is destructive to cultural learning and can be demotivating. Do systems of optimization like Six Sigma and Lean systems have a place in knowledge-based work where they can create value and if they do, is the value created to overcome any harm these methodologies and framework cause. 

		 - > The organizations that will truly excel in the future will be the organization that discovers how to tap people's commitment and capacity to learn at all levels in an organization.
			 - Successful organizations need to be managed as complex adaptive systems rather than as intricate controlled machines.
				 - Feedback loops are a hallmark of complex systems and building well-designed and many feedback loops is crucial for an organization to work and evolve.

				 - Complex systems also self-regulate, but they require thoughtful leadership to optimize their potential. Decisions and solutions, especially consequential processes have to be carefully planned and thought out. 

	 - Learning to Team, teaming to learn
		 - The main goals of teaming is to bring people together to generate new ideas, answers and solve problems. 

		 - __Teaming is essential when the following work conditions are present__
			 - When work requires people to juggle multiple objectives with minimal oversight

			 - When people must be able to shift from one situation to another while maintaining high levels of communication and tight coordination. This situation literally defines the practice of teaming.

			 - When it is helpful to integrate perspectives from different disciplines.

			 - When collaborating across dispersed locations.

			 - When pre-planned coordination is impossible or unrealistic due to the changing nature of the work. 

			 - When complex information must be processed, synthesized, and put to good use quickly.

	 - Organizing to Learn
		 - Organizing to learn is useful when production processes are not yet developed. The team must be willing to experiment rather than conform.

		 - Organizing to learn is away of [[leadership]] that encourages critical teaming behaviors to promote collective learning. 
			 - Learning for individuals and groups is an active process of gaining information, understanding, or capabilities. It is also reflecting on our actions. 

		 - For teams to be successful we need to expand our access to shared knowledge and understanding to apply it to our problems and generate new insights. This means groups are required to collectively learn. 

		 - Team learning is compromised of activities like collecting, sharing, or analyzing information; obtaining and reflecting feedback from customers or others; and active experimentation. This will allow teams to apply collective understanding and knowledge in a coordinated manner reflective of new insights. 

		 - Team members are asked to take personal risks such as discussing mistakes and in turn, this requires leadership to create environments that support and encourage sharing, experimenting, and learning.

		 - Performance is measured from learning from both our successes and failures through our experimentation. 

		 - Organizing to learn prioritizes learning over efficiency of execution as a competitive edge.

	 - Execution as learning
		 - Is a way of operating an organization that combines continuous learning with high performance. It means getting the work done while simultaneously working on how to do it better. 

		 - The defining attribute of execution as learning is the constant small-scale learning into the day-to-day work. Execution-as-learning is like reflection-in-action, rather than reflection-after-action.

		 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FIN9KBlodtN.png?alt=media&token=ebb3badc-002a-4522-875c-f3763284e0eb)

		 - When process knowledge is well developed or mature, as in a manufacturing setting, uncertainty is low. When employees follow a prescribed set of direction, they get a certain result. 

		 - At the other end of the spectrum is innovation operations, where much of the sought-after knowledge is yet to be discovered. Because prior experience of achieving the goal is limited, it makes the process of learning require risk-taking and experimentation. 

		 - The approach a leader takes toward helping their organization learn must match the state of process knowledge, either well-known processes that is ripe for efficiency and optimization or undeveloped processes requiring experimentation and learning to create new innovations.

		 - For undeveloped processes, trust and respect helps create a work environment conducive for teaming and continous learning.  

- Chapter 2 - Teaming To Learn, Innovate, and Compete
	 - The teaming process
		 - Teaming is a learning process. No sequence of events will ever unfold the same way twice when people are interacting to coordinate ideas or actions so participants in such a process are always in a position to learn. 
			 - The teaming process is iterative with cycles of communication, decision, action, and reflection.  Each cycle should inform the next and itself be informed from the lessons learned from the previous cycle. 
				 - Each team member should find new applications of their new collective knowledge to improve organizational routines and processes.

			 - Teaming is only possible if members are aware of their interdependence of each other to complete a whole job.
				 - Communication becomes natural despite members working in departmental silos.

		 - Because teaming is a mindset an individual can join a team and disband once the team's work is done and join another team and still productive. 

	 - The four pillars of effective teaming
		 - Speaking up:
			 - Teaming depends on honest direct, conversation between individuals, including asking questions, seeking feedback, and discussing errors.
				 - Allows us to tap into and incorporate multiple perspectives #knowlege

				 - Crucial when confronting crucial [[problem]]s and [[failure]]s

				 - Speaking up as default behavior for team members must be cultivated rather than assumed it naturally exists. 
					 - #fear #[[Psychological Safety]] Behaviorally people overestimate risks, and in the work environment we are fearful of offending someone above us in the organizational hierarchy and therefore we withhold information

		 - [[Collaboration]]:
			 - Teaming requires a collaborative mindset and behaviorsâ€”both inside and outside the teaming unitâ€”to drive the process

			 - Is characterized by cooperation, mutual respect, and shared goals
				 - It involves sharing information, coordinating actions, discussing what's working and what's not and perpetually seeking feedback

		 - Experimentation:
			 - Teaming involves iterative approaches to action that acknowledges uncertainty and mistakes are part of the process and are expected.

			 - It means expecting not to be right the first time. 

		 - Reflection:
			 - Teaming relies on the use of explicit observations, questions, and discussion of processes and outcomes

			 - It is the habit of critically examining the results of actions to assess results and uncover new ideas. 

			 - Reflections don't have to be a formal process, research shows there isn't a difference in outcomes for teams with formal reflection sessions compared to those without. Reflections can be a mindset rather than a formal process. 
				 - Though for some teams and situations, it may be worth to wait for the formal outcomes to occur before a reflection comes about rather than enacting a reflection in action. 

	 - Benefits of teaming
		 - Organizational Learning, Performance, and Change Management
			 - Teaming promotes the development of new processes and routines to meet the demands of variable and fast changing business environment. An organization that operates in a rapidly changing business field requires quick understanding and coordination across departments and disciplines.

			 - #[[change management]] Teams are the best agents to model change in an organization.

			 - [[performance]] improves when we utilize knowledge (both old and new) in novel ways

			 - Teaming is more effective than top down controlled organization when it comes to [[performance]]

		 - Engaged employees
			 - Teaming allows greater between employees to foster learning of each other's processes, a broader understanding of the work and its completion from start to finish. Opportunities and areas for improvement are more discoverable in a teaming environment. 

			 - Engaged employees are able to combine their knowledge and skillset to invent new products, routines and processes.
