	- Intro
		- "Every interesting thing I've ever done, every important thing I've ever done, every beneficial thing I've ever done, has been through a cascade of experiments and mistakes and failures," Bezos continued.

		- Bezos wanted to set his own metrics to set up his own metrics for success, without interference from impatient outsiders, so he encoded his operating philosophy in his first letter to shareholders, vowing a focus not on immediate financial returns or on satisfying myopic demands of Wall Street, but on increasing cash flow and growing market share to generate value long term for loyal shareholders.

		- The act of business building at Amazon was an editorial process, with papers subject to numerous revisions, debate over meaning of individual words, and meticulous consideration by leaders, most of all from Bezos himself.
		  id:: 889bb621-de47-4e6d-9d70-2334e7bd7e26
		- Goals, accountability, and deadlines were pushed down into the organization while metrics were fed upward, via weekly and quarterly business reports and biannual company-wide reviews, called OP1 (operating plan, in the late summer) and OP2 (after the holidays).

	- Chapter 1
		- The CEO, for example, went to great lengths to illustrate Amazon’s principal, “frugality”: Accomplish more with less. ^^Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. ^^There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense. His wife, MacKenzie, drove him to work most days in their Honda minivan, and when he flew with colleagues on his private Dassault Falcon 900EX jet, he often mentioned that he personally, not Amazon, had paid for the flight.
		- If Bezos took one leadership principle most to heart—which would also come to define the next half decade at Amazon—it was principal ,^^ “think big”: Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.^^

			- Bezos wrote: “Invention is in our DNA and technology is the fundamental tool we wield to evolve and improve every aspect of the experience we provide our customers.”
			  id:: 5e12e23e-8872-42d7-aa35-5d1fa27c7b2c
			- Bezos jotted their ideas down on a whiteboard, adding a few of his own, and then started to apply his usual criteria to assess their merit: If they work, will they grow to become big businesses? If the company didn’t pursue them aggressively now, would it miss an opportunity? (Regarding the echo and Alexa)
		- Amazon Alexa
			- Evi employed a programming technique called knowledge graphs, or large databases of ontologies, which connect concepts and categories in related domains. If, for example, a user asked Evi, “What is the population of Cleveland?” the software interpreted the question and knew to turn to an accompanying source of demographic data. Wired described the technique as a “giant treelike structure” of logical connections to useful facts.
			- ^^Throwing more engineers at failing technology projects only makes them fail more spectacularly.^^
				- Bezos didn’t penalize Ian Freed and other Fire Phone managers, sending a strong message inside Amazon that taking risks was rewarded—especially if the entire debacle was primarily his own fault.
				  id:: 8ae42f0b-3ae6-4e72-8686-01eb7347a724
				- __On the other hand, it revealed a worrisome fact about life inside Amazon. Many employees who worked on the Fire Phone had serious doubts about it, but no one, it seemed, had been brave or clever enough to take a stand and win an argument with their obstinate leader.__
			- George also instituted a dramatic change in the Alexa group’s structure. It had been a functional organization, with centralized engineering, product management, and marketing teams. But that wasn’t growing smoothly or fast enough for Bezos’s liking. George instead reorganized Alexa around the Amazonian ideal of fast-moving “two pizza” teams, each devoted to a specific Alexa domain, like music, weather, lighting, thermostats, video devices, and so on.
				- Each team was run by a so-called “single-threaded leader” who had ultimate control and absolute accountability over their success or failure. (The phrase comes from computer science terminology; a single-threaded program executes one command at a time.) Alexa, like Amazon itself, became a land of countless CEOs, each operating autonomously. To yoke them all together, George oversaw the creation of a “north star” document, to crystalize the strategy of a global, voice-enabled computing platform.
			- Meanwhile Bezos approved all these changes and stayed intimately involved, attending product reviews and reading the Friday night compilation of updates from all the various two-pizza teams, and responding with detailed questions or problems that the groups would then have to fix over the weekend.^^ Alexa execs, like leaders elsewhere in Amazon, became frequent recipients of the CEO’s escalation emails, in which he forwarded a customer complaint accompanied by a single question mark and then expected a response within twenty-four hours.^^ He was also the chief evangelist for Alexa within the company. “What are you doing for Alexa?” he asked other executives, as he had for AWS years before. Everyone in the company had to include Alexa in the OP1 documents they presented to the S-team, describing their plans for the coming year.
			- Later, Alexa execs would say that Bezos’s close involvement made their lives more difficult but also produced immeasurable results. Jeff “gave us the license and permission to do some of the things we needed to do to go faster and to go bigger,” Toni Reid said. “You can regulate yourself quite easily or think about what you’re going to do with your existing resources…. Sometimes, you don’t know what the boundaries are. Jeff just wanted us to be unbounded.”

	- Chapter 2 - Amazon Go Stores
		- Amazon spent millions investing in Amazon Go (grocery stores) but this has yet to lead financial returns
		- > If you swing for the fences, we all know we're going to strike out, but there are also swings that result in home runs. The difference between baseball and business is that in baseball you have a truncated outcome distribution—you cant at most only hit four points on a home run. But in business the points can be unlimited. This long tail distribution of return is why it's important to be bold.

	- Chapter 3
		- Transporting Amazon to operate in China and India was challenging for Amazon. In China, Alibaba and JD.com understood the marketplace culture of China. Amazon lost market share to only 1% due to misunderstanding the local culture. They were timid followers instead of leaders while trying to operate in China.
		- For India, Amazon learned from it's failure in China and set out to become market leaders. Amazon studied the ultra competitive environment to bring lessons learned to India.
		- Impactful decisions were covered by 6-page memos and documents containing detailed analyses for the plans in India and Mexico.
		  id:: f41d8eeb-7a87-4759-b18b-f234c53b1977
			- For example a document outlined the plan for removing Amazon's dependency on Google search ads to feature Amazon products. The Mexico Amazon site would test as the guinea pig. 
			  id:: 5170a495-48d8-488b-ab7d-cce92c2fd1f4
				- The test resulted that Amazon indeed needed Google's search ads to attract customers. The decision however was reversible. 
				  id:: 5d95f324-88bb-4582-83e9-fdec2dd1a431
		- Despite the cultural adaptation of Amazon in India it remains grossly unprofitable for Amazon to operate in India.
	- Chapter 4
		- Bezos correctly assessed that there was no annuities in retail. Customers were fickle and could change their loyalties anytime. Amazon could only stay ahead of rivals if it kept inventing new technologies and improving levels of service.
		- AWS's culture mirrored that of Amazon's: tough, unrelenting, and focused on meeting impossibly high standards. Managers asked searing questions of their underlings and hammered anyone without suitable answers or who didn't embrace accountability for a problem within their purview. Daily operations were driven by data-filled six-page narratives and the obsessive contemplation of the needs of customers. When employees returned strong results, attention always turned to the ways in which they could have done better. 
		  id:: e752897d-d8f8-45d4-b173-de315ce120de
	- Chapter 5
		- When Bezos bought the Washington Post he extolled embracing technology, rapid experimentation, and optimism about the opportunities.
		- Bezos brought in the 6 page memos to force innovation and creative thinking backed with data and analysis.
		  id:: 7366ce29-2fba-49d9-a897-81809d882fe1
		- > The most important thing Jeff has brought is a culture of experimentation. None of us feel that if we spend money and screw up some big project that we're going to have to face an auditing committee. We are not afraid to fail.

	- Chapter 6
		- Regarding decisions to make shows for Amazon Prime, Bezos said: "There must be a way to test these concepts. You are telling me that we are making $100 million decisions, and we don't have time to evaluate whether they are good decisions? There must be a way for us to see what will work and what won't, so we don't have to make all these decisions in a vacuum."
	- Chapter 7
		- > Averages are bad measures. I want to see actuals, highs, lows, and whys—not an average. An average is just lazy."
		- If you focus on the business inputs, then the outputs such as revenue and income will take care of themselves.
	- Chapter 8
		- Amazon had random failed ideas like the Treasure Truck, Amazon Go stores, and Amazon burgers. Not everything Amazon did was great.
	- Chapter 9
		- Amazon also used third-party data like item sales to understand which products to copy and create their own Amazon label.
		- Amazon increase their effectiveness of shipping logistics through buying stocks of airline companies that shielded from the dangers of outright owning planes and pilots (aviation regulations, pilot unions)
			- There were safety issues reported. Overworked pilots, below industry pay, and less experienced pilots.
		- Similarly, Amazon contracted with companies for last mile drivers, providing uniforms and Amazon vans.
		- Amazon Exploitation
			- Doesn't provide healthcare to it's workers
			- Maintain the  congested roads to and from its FCs and sort centers, or sustain the temporary employees who got job in its FCs over the holidays and then were unemployed and collected public benefits for the rest of the year.
			- Their driving contractors killed people in driving accidents
		- Clark attributes his success with creating the logistics machinery of Amazon's delivery processes to simplification. "I can take complicated stuff and figure out how to boil it down into what you need to do to actually make it big."
	- Chapter 10
		- Deterioration of profitability in Amazon's retail business was being covered up by  the profitability of the advertising ran in the Amazon site. This was due to Bezos earlier directive to compete on price to increase market share. However Bezos shifted and now wanted again to shoot for profitability and to leverage Amazon's scale to push for more efficiencies in per unit profit.
		- When deciding on whether to place sponsored ads on top of search pages, he tested with small percent of them before fully rolling out.
	- Chapter 11
		- Bezos studied the early success of SpaceX and decided to replicate their service of selling launch services.
		- It's okay to make errors, but these type of errors have to be sophisticated and not embarrassing.
		  id:: b1338019-9009-4f7c-b7ea-ef97956872e1
	- Chapter 12
		- Amazon's factors and domains for picking HQ2 was thrown out in the final decisions of the cities. Cities were disappointed that the original domains of "diversity, tax incentives, and cheap cost of living" did not influence the final decisions of picking the cities like Northern Virginia and New York City.
		  id:: e8dde673-52d5-4c0f-a7ae-0e4221d9ab65
	- Chapter 13
		- Those who have a system for making decisions win. You need a specific methodology to attack any issue, the same way a chess master knows how to play any opening or defend against one once the match starts #[[Decision Making]]
		  id:: 9c3b7ffa-d71d-4acf-a350-ed5f069cca99
	- Chapter 14
		- Regarding commentary and critique: "What I teach and preach inside Amazon is [that] when you're criticized, first look in a mirror and decide, are your critics right? If they're right, change. Don't resist." #[[q: How to receive feedback]]
	- Chapter 15
		- When the Covid pandemic started, Amazon was quick to hire consultants to advise them on how to best prepare their workforce and workplace even before the government had recommended quarantining. Amazon was proactive in preparing their business and saw the possible effects that the pandemic would have. #[[q: How to be proactive]]

				- We can  change our initial process of our decision making but there is a risk of sidelining our coworkers.

				- If you are not in an environment with high level thinking, raise the standards yourself. Can you create excellence in the space that you have Can you raise standards on yourself, grow accountable and learn to reflect on your decisions and actions? How do we drive and push for excellence when the environment you are in accepts mediocrity?

				- Consider the meaningfulness of the metrics which you are given and the standards you have to work by. Understand what they are trying to measure and what problems they are trying to solve.
			- ((22fc6a40-c0d8-4614-9225-119a947d08f4))
				- It's okay to think small if that small one thing is a small piece of a larger goal.
			- ((5e12e23e-8872-42d7-aa35-5d1fa27c7b2c))
				- Bezos thought of the future, he envisioned we would be talking to our devices and wanted to have a microphone on our kindles. This was eventually removed, but future products like the echo was the successor of this idea.
				- Bezos didn't live in the past, rather he continually thought of what would be great in the future. Of course not all ideas were good, but from the bad ideas he was able to learn.
			- ((f7524029-390d-4c03-afc0-3feeca780d0e))
				- Question leadership if they are constraining you to deliver success and excellence. Don't chase their approval if their thinking is subpar.
