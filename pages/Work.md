- A workaholic brings fear into the equation. She works all the time to be sure everything is all right, and she experiences resistance all the time. She  satisfies the raging fear of her lizard brain by being at the job site all the time, just to be sure. I’m not a workaholic. There’s no fear because I’ve  ingrained the habit of shipping. The lizard brain has no chance, so it shuts up  and finds something else to worry about. ([[Seth Godin]], [[Linchpin]])
