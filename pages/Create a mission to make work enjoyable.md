- **Note:**
	 - We don't want to be working for others, but for our own enjoyment and goals. We can use our mission to help us create work, a fulfilling activity that we want to do for a very long time.

	 - By pursuing greatness and excellence, we can enjoy our work when we receive control, creativity and impact.
