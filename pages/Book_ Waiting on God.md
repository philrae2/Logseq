- Notes:
	 - Fourth Day:
		 - Verse: The Lord upholdeth all that fall, And raiseth up all those that be be bowed down. The eyes of all wait upon Thee; And Thou givest them their meat in due season. Ps. 145:14,15
			 - We are to prove there is nothing more noble or more blessed in the exercise of our free will than to use it in waiting upon God.

			 - Every day and in every moment in life, we should [[surrender]] to God, keep Him in our minds, be aware of our need of him to [[supply]] and bless us for to face day. 
				 - How can we be [[bless]]ed from the beginning of the day if we don't [[commune]] with God in the [[morning]]?    
					 - There is a difference between [[praying]] and [[waiting]]. There may be much praying but very little waiting on God. In praying we are often preoccupied with ourselves, with our own [[need]]s, and our own [[effort]]s. When we [[wait]] on God, the [[attention]] is on God, not ourselves. 
						 - When we wait on God, we enter His [[presence]], and feel we need to be quite, so that he, as God, can [[overshadow]] us with Himself.     
							 - It is especially during [[prayer]] we should cultivate this spirit of waiting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

	 - Fifth Day:
		 - Verse: Shew me thy ways, O Lord; Teach me Thy paths. Teach me Thy paths. Lead me in Thy truth, and teach me; For Thou art the  God of my salvation; ^^On Thee do I wait all the day^^.' - Ps. 25:4, 5

	 - God cannot part with His grace, or goodness, or strength, as an external thing that He gives us, and we can only enjoy it as He works it Himself directly and unceasingly. And the only reason that He does not work it more effectively and continuously is, that we do not let Him. We hinder Him either by our [[ indifference]] or by our [[self-effort]], so that He cannot do what He would.What He asks of us, in the way of [[surrender]], and [[obedience]], and desire, and trust, is all comprised in one word: waiting on Him, waiting for His salvation.
