	  Well, there was a lot written about physician leadership. A lot of articles were talking about the importance of it and chatting about a feeling in a sense that they felt. This was in many medical journals had written about physician leadership, but there had been very little, very simple empirical evidence at all to show, well, are they running hospitals at the moment? And are those hospitals working? Is it working out quite well? So when I did this, I had already replicated the finding in basketball in Formula One, in hospitals, in various other settings. I started off just looking at the US News and World Report Best Hospital ranking and I looked at the top 100 hospitals across three specialisms. I separated the CEOs out from Managers' CEOs and MD CEOs. So very, very simple relationship and just looked at the hospitals that were ranked. And I found that in all cases, hospitals that were ranked higher were more likely to be led by physicians than they were by non-physician managers. And it was about 25% higher performance scores in those hospitals. Now since then, and it was a very simple start, and I should say that empirically, we're all aware that correlations don't mean causality, but another study has replicated my finding, in fact, an American-based research group.
