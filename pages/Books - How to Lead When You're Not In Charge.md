- Foreword:
	- Everyone is accountable to somebody. Don't use the excuse of "If I were in charge" or "When I'm in charge" for poor performance or lack of initiative.
		- Q: What is leadership?

		- Q: What are the components of leadership?

		- Q: How can cultivate [[influence]]?
		- Real leadership is finding a way to lead and enacting change without authority.
			- Great leaders leverage influence and relationships over title and position.
			- The best leaders lead like they're not in charge.
- 1. The Oddity of [[Leadership]]
	- Don't wait for the opportunity to lead through formal authority, rather discover and take the opportunities of leadership roles without formal authority.
	- When in a leadership role, don't blame others.
		- Don't give excuses or deflect, rather take ownership of the situation and find solutions and improvements.
	- Good leadership entails
		- ^^[[influence]] is the currency of leadership and you don't need authority to have it.^^
		  id:: 31c8ff17-e532-41db-8c54-8df80e734782
			- Our goal is for people to wantâ€”not forceâ€”to follow us
			- Jesus argues the best leaders, the ones who align with his version of leadership, will lead as servants who are aware of their responsibility and who answer to a higher calling.
		- confidence given by others is necessary to influence and lead
		  id:: 60a41e36-ec87-4419-8b74-8442b5cecc2f
			- if a leader does not inspire confidence, then they won't be able to effect change without brute force
	- > Many people at the top of organizations are not leaders. They have authority, but they are not leaders. And many at the bottom with no authority are absolutely leaders.
	- > Each of us can create a pocket of greatness. Each of us can take our own area of work and influence and can concentrate on moving it from good to great. It doesn't really matter whether all the CEOs get it. It only matters that you do.
		- **Be patient!** People will notice the work you are doing. #comment
- 2. [[Identity]] Crisis
	- Near the core of what makes a person a leader is their sense of [[identity]].
	  id:: 1a2692fe-a4fd-416b-a0f6-058b48911389
		- Your sense of identity directs you in every situation
			- Determines your level of [[confidence]] (e.g., when you challenge your boss in a disagreement)
			- Establishes your sense of [[security]] when you face doubts
			- Enables you to process your [[emotion]]s during tense conversation
		- Most people focus on learning new behaviors to compensate for a lack of [[authority]].
			- ^^Leading well without formal authority has less to do with behavior and far more with your identity.^^
	- How we see ourselves affects our ability:
		- to follow others
		- to lead others
		- find the future God has for us
	- Our identities precede our behavior, our behavior flow form our identities.
		- Therefore first time examining who we are as leadersâ€”our identityâ€”over what we do as leaders, especially when we are not in charge
		- Don't switch identities so you can fit better in your environment, be honest about who you are. Don't pretend to be someone else.
			- Accepting a distorted reality of your identity (exaggerating your skills or self-perception or being too critical) will erode your ability to lead
				- If you think too lowly of yourself, you will judge yourself as unqualified or unworthy of leadership opportunities to make and create something great with the responsibility you've been given.
				- If you think too highly of yourself, you will tend to overestimate your abilities, leading to stealing credit for other people's work or lying to cover up for your shortcomings and failures
	- ((a871abb3-3268-4108-ac18-5f15b9531551))
	- ^^Our identity will be best shaped if we allow our heavenly Father's voice to be the loudest one in our life. Our identity will the be right identity when we let it be defined by what God says about us. ^^
		- Our identity is healthiest when what God says about us is most true.
		- If we fail to believe what God says about our identity, we will fail to reach the potential he's put in in us as leaders.
			- Our ability to be fearless leaders is rooted in our identity.
				- The best leaders may or may not have all the authority they need or want, but the security of their identityâ€”especially as someone called and loved by Godâ€”gives them the freedom and fearlessness to do what is right. They are able to challenge well, to lead by making a way even where there isn't a way.
				- ^^If you believe God actually controls your career, what place does fear have in your life?^^
					- When God is informing your identity, he may call you to honor your boss even more, but you'll also have the freedom to challenge your boss even more, but you'll also have the freedom to challenge him with good intentions, unafraid to speak the truth when necessary.
					- ^^Every time we respond with fear, we miss an opportunity lead and this failure of leadership is an issue of identity. ^^
						- If you sense fear in yourself, the best way to face those fears is with a healthier sense of self.
							- Turn up the volume of what is true about you, and listen to what God says about you.
								- There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made in perfect love (1 John 4:18) â€” God loves you, so don't fear.
	- Captive thoughts
		- Don't allow thoughts of [[fear]], [[inadequacy]], and insecurity to take up residence in your mind.
			- If you do, they will erode your identity and render you an ineffective [[leader]].
- 3. [[Ambition]]
	- Definition: the strong desire to make something or achieve something, even when it takes great effort, focus, and determination.
	- Don't let your ambition take a selfish tone.
		- Let your ambition be selfless and generous. Strive to ensure success for others. #blck:grey
			- Success means ensuring and striving for others to be successful. #blck:red
			  id:: ed84b45a-e476-4ae6-843d-52c0d2799270
		- When we let our ambitions run wild, we start looking for external solutions and will tend to blame and defer responsibility to others because we haven't fulfilled our ambitions.
			- We grow resentful and critical towards others who are in charge because we are looking for our own authority.
			- Don't fast track your learning of skills by circumventing leadership above you. Let God take the driver's seat. #blck:yellow
	- On the other hand, don't wait for a specific job title or authority (waiting on God to provide).
		- God doesn't want us to sit back. He wants us to engage, doing the work he has given us where we are, with whatever title or role has currently assigned. #blck:yellow
	- **Good leadership is:** #blck:red
		- Giving space for people to thrive and cultivating growth in others through time, attention, care and kind correction.
		- Serving to lead
		- Marked with humility because they that prides sets us against God.
		- Longs to organize and create for the betterment of allâ€” for the good of others and not just the good of the leader
- 4. Lead Yourself
	- If you want to grow as a leader, don't blame your boss for the outcomes of your ambitions and situations.
		- Your boss is not in charge of you. You are in charge of yourself.
		- When you're not in charge, it's common to abdicate responsibility, this is a sign of bad leadership.
	- Your greatest responsibility as a leader is to lead yourself. #blck:red
		- You need to your desires and ambitions; no one can lead you any further than you're leading yourself. Before others can lead you, you must learn how to lead yourself.
		- > Nothing so conclusively prove a man's ability to lead others as what he does on a day-to-day basis to lead himself. â€” [[Tom Watson]]
	- [[Stewardship]]: Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much (Luke 16:10). #blck:grey
		- With the small choices you make when no one else is looking, when it's just you and God you are proving or disproving to him (and to yourself) your future ability to lead others.
	- Self-Leadership Principles
		- 1. **Model Followership**
			- The first step to master in becoming a leader who leads well when not in charge is how to model what it means to be a follower. #blck:grey
				- How you respond to a bad boss, a terrible decisions, or how you handle the stress of being overloaded, will exhibit your leadership character, even when you lack the formal authority to lead.
				- Your moral authority is vastly more important than your positional authority, and nothing erodes moral authority more than undermining the person you claim to be following.
		- **2. Monitor Your Heart and Behavior**
			- Monitoring your heart requires constantly checking your motives and feelings before God. Leading ourselves requires monitoring the dark corners of our hears where dangerous emotions reside.
			- We should foster a healthy dose of curiosity of how others see our behavior so we can grow and improve. We need to cultivate interest in how others see the way we act and lead.
		- **3. Make a Plan**
			- **1. Know Where You Are**
				- > Truly great leaders, no matter how successful they become, maintain a learning curve as steep as when they first began their careers.
					- For us to maintain a steep learning curve, we need to be honest about where we are and how we got there there.
					- Before we create a plan for our own growth, we need to ask our supervisor our shortcomings. #blck:yellow
						- > If an opportunity for promotion became available, what would keep you from fully recommending me?
			- **2. Have a vision for where you want to go**
				- We should only respond to opportunities and circumstances given to us, rather we need to have personal lives for our lives, a plan for our futures.
					- It's dangerous to hold too tightly to the plans we've determined for ourselves, but it's just as dangerous to have no vision or direction for stewarding the gifts, talents, and opportunities God has given us.
			- **3. Develop the discipline and accountability to do what it takes to stay on track**
	- Drop unmet expectations to save relationships
		- Expectations always affect relationships. If you have unmet expectations, it's best to let them go rather than holding to them and growing resentful at people who fail to meet them.  Our supervisors don't owe us anything beyond being treated fairly.
	- Sometimes God will use bad leaders to affect the change he wants in us.
- 5. Choose [[Positivity]]
	- Perspective is everything: How we see the world has less to do with the way the world is and more to do with the way we are.
		- > We must look at the lens through which we see the world, as well as the world we see and that the lens itself shapes how we interpret the world.
			- When we're trying to understand our role and how to find satisfaction in our job even when we lack the power or authority to effect change, we must first look at the lens through which we see the world.
		- Gain a greater perspective of the world, especially, see how God's plans for you are, compared to your own goals.
		- The satisfaction we have as employees have in a job is directly correlated to our ability to se how what we do fits into the big picture.
		- ^^Leaders who feel a strong sense of ownership and made the crucial connection between what their job is and how it drives results for the organization are more deeply engaged. ^^
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2F0g5AG0GkPt.png?alt=media&token=cc625156-bc03-43a0-9c73-596be95be2eb)
	- What informs your view?
		- What you believe about God and how you see the future are the foundational voice for how you will lead right now. A small view of God leads to an outlook of despair.
		- The two foundations that supported Paul's panoptic view were his trust in God and his [[hope]] for the future.
			- Hope is a confident expectation of something good to come. The basis of our Christian faith is that our God is a God who is always able, always moving, and always working on our behalf.
				- Even when it feels like He's silent, he's never distant. Even when it feels like it's over, hope allows us to trust because of what we believe in our God.
					- As followers of Jesus, we should be the most hope filled people on the planet.
	- What does your view produce?
		- > When the powerful truths become the foundation for how you see, you can do the inconceivable. You can choose positivity.
			- **Positivity can be a character trait. **
				- Choose positivity even when you weren't asked for feedback in a system build out or creation of a process.
				- > More important than making the right decision is owning the decision handed to you and making it right. Positivity will help you with this.
				- Positive leaders are attractive to others.
			- **Energy in Your Attitude**
				- Your attitude can have the most impact on your team. The greatest contribution you can bring to your team is your attitude, more than your talents, gifts, experience, or education.
			- **[[Humility]] to those in [[Authority]]**
				- It's God who ultimately establishes authority, not man.
				- Romans 13:1, tells us that if we're frustrated with the job we don't have, maybe we still have work to do. If you think you should be promoted and you haven't been promoted yet, perhaps there's still some growth God has planned for you.
					- A deep trust in God and persistent hope for the future will push you to keep growing and learning because you believe God is getting you ready for something he will lift you into. Until he does, you're not quite ready. This kind of humility allows us to keep working on our craft, knowing that when we're ready, our time will come. #[[Professional Development]]
			- **Unity with our Associates**
				- We are better together. ((ed84b45a-e476-4ae6-843d-52c0d2799270)) Don't be selfish.
		-
	- The Final Lift (God does the lifting)
		- "__Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time__" (1 Peter 5:6)
			- God does the lifting in our lives. We need to keep our heads down and work hard on the responsibilities we are given with. In due time God will lift us up. We don't know when due time is so let us trust and be patient with God.
			- ^^If you are working on something great, your time will come. And if your time hasn't come yet, keep working to create something great. ^^
- 6. Think Critically #[[Critical Thinking]]
	- Choose positivity, but also think critically.
	- Be observant and pay attention to your environment and look for improvements and problems to solve.
		- Critical thinkers are able to observe and make connections between seemingly disconnected behaviors and feelings.  They are self-aware and have the innate skill of connecting the feelings people have to the contributing behaviors causing those feelings.
			- Great leaders who lead great organizations, ask questions and connect their observations in ways others can't. They find simple ways to communicate these connections to volunteers who feel valued and part of the process.
			- Leadership is the ability to motivate people to work harder, longer, and smarter, because the vision of the end goal has been painted so clearly.
			- Critically thinking involves:
				- noticing abnormalities
				- connecting the dots between feelings and actions
				- questioning assumptions
	- **Four Critical Thinking Shifts for Leadership**
		- Stop thinking as an employee. Start thinking as an owner.
			- To do your best on a project. Act as if you owned it. Own the consequences and the actions of your collaborators. Don't defer to others. Pick up and clean-up the trash, even if you didn't create the mess. #blck:red
				- All the work we do matters to God, and we will be held accountable for it all
		- Stop stacking your meetings. Start scheduling thinking time.
			- Allow time for generation of new thoughts and new ideas.
			- Thinking critically requires uninterrupted mental space. This is the cost of a [[distracted]] mind. #distractions
		- Stop being critical. Start thinking critically.
			- Being critical is not thinking critically.
				- When we are critical, we give off the message that we want that person to lose. We're giving off the incorrect signal that we're motivated to tear something down. We should be offering constructive criticisms, not destructive ones.
				- When we are critical thinkers instead we want others to win. We should give the message that we want to create and build something better. That may require deconstruction, but it is for the betterment of others.
		- Stop giving others a grade. Start lending them a hand.
			- No one likes the feeling of being graded, monitored and measured.
				- When thinking critically make sure you are not making others feel evaluated or judged.
					- It isn't about the thoughts you should convey but rather how communicate those thoughts. We can communicate hard and honest truths and say it with love and care towards others.
						- Assure that we are with and for the listener.
				- ^^Always present a solution to any problem you raise. Issue recognition is lazy and doesn't win friends. ^^
			- Great leaders know how to communicate critical thoughts in a way that benefits others.
			- Think positively and be a critical thinker. Be known as a value-add, a problem solver. As you pursue the skill of thinking critically, keep that image in mindâ€”the picture of Jesus on his knee, towel in hand, washing the filthy feet of his closest followers. #[[Servant Leadership]]
- 7. Reject [[Passivity]]
	- We can build success for ourselves by giving others control for our own success. We can influence others to own our success and in turn their support and help, by giving them control of our success. [[q: How do we build success?]] When people are feeling disconnected due to a lack of control and thus ownership, they become passive.
		- We are passive when we work for someone else and don't have a sense of ownership on the outcomes of our work. If authority makes us feel in control, the lack of authority makes us feel, acutely, our lack of control and we are tempted to disconnect with the outcomes and responsibility. This is especially felt when we are handed decisions that we had no part in. We often act passively and reject accountability.
		- Our lack of authority is not an excuse to disconnect and work hard to own the outcomes. Accepting passivity and disconnecting from the consequences of our work makes sure that the worst outcome does happen and ensures we never get the authority we so badly want.
	- There is nothing helpful about passivity in leading others. We rob ourselves of remaining passive because we are waiting around for others to give us the responsibility and authority to lead. We can lead and learn without formal authority.  If fear of failure is the cause of your passivity, it's OK to fail. Failure is a way of learning.
	- The best teammates are those who are willing to share ideas, who are able to withstand their idea not being used, and who understand when they're asked to carry something outside their job description for a reason. These people may also be the ones who won't go out of their way to do a job outside their job description without an authority person telling  them to do so.
		- Hoping someone will hand you responsibility is a waste of your time and shows a lack of proactivity to your boss. If we truly want to be a leader who is leading when we're not in charge and capable of being trusted with more, then we have to be willing to add responsibilities to our current role. Don't play the waiting game or we'll miss opportunities to lead. #leadership
			- It's not your boss's job to give you more responsibility. We can look for more responsibility, problems to solve and take more ownership of finding solutions all on our own. We can send a message that we are already leaders to leadership.
	- **Plans to combat passivity**
		- Choose to solve a problem
		- Plan a path for building success
			- Don't present only problems to your boss, come up with a plan
		- Respond
			- Leaders must resist the passivity of not being in control. We need to respond to what is important for our boss', leadership and the organization as a whole.
			- Being under the authority of someone else often feels like waiting, but let's not turn waiting into an act of passivity. Think differently. If we are in the season of waiting what can we learn (skills, knowledge) now that we can only learn from this position? What barriers can we remove at our current role?
			- We never passively find what we do not actively pursue. We're not going to be in a leadership position if just wait for someone to give it to us. Find a way to initiate by choosing, planning, and responding. Make use of the time God has given us because what we're doing now matters greatly!
- 8. Challenging Up
	- Leaders make a way when others can't find a way. Leaders look at what is, see what could be, and organize others to move toward the preferred future. Leaders are not okay with "this is the way we've always done it."  They refuse to accept mediocrity. Leaders are not content to sit on the sidelines, where there are potential changes pregnant with greater results.
		- Great leaders don't get defensive.
			- Any change to the present system will be perceived as a criticism of past leadership. So communicate your plans for actions with this in mind.
			- Before you embark on challenging the status quo, make sure you have invested and put in the work in the right relationships and you are certain those relationships can bear the weight of you bringing those challenges.
			- Make sure you communicate properly the building blocks of your solutions correctly. Your communication can either build a wall or a bridge to the people you need help from.
				- Don't compare your team or organization to another "better" team or business
				- Don't emphatically declare what you're doing now is wrong
				- Don't blame the current situation to anyone, especially your boss
				- Don't offer ultimatums. Ultimatums eventually undermine our leadership. "If I don't get the budget for that, I'm just not sure I can pull off the event." Someone may have done more with less or other leaders may have made something work that you said is not possible. Bring others into the analysis and evaluation process,  rather than presenting your findings. At minimum explain your process and methodology.
		- Great leaders challenge up with the best motives.
		- Great leaders are keenly aware of what the boss is most interested in.
		- Great leaders know what's core and what's peripheral.
		- Great leaders challenge up quietly, but they are not silent.
			- They know how, when, and with whom to communicate when trying something new.
		- > If you believe in yourself and have dedication and prideâ€”and never quitâ€”you'll be a winner. The price of victory is high but so are the rewards.
			- Victory is not just the change that takes place because you challenge up and lead when you aren't the one in charge. The victory is also the growth that takes place when you enter this process of learning as a leader. God can grow us through the process of challenging our bosses.
- 9. Breaking down the challenging up
	- When you challenge up, nothing is more important than the relationship you have with the person you're challenging. > You don't necessarily need to like your boss. You might not be buddies. You might not choose to hang with them on the weekends. But you need to choose to love your boss. Loving your boss means you genuinely want what's best for them and you're trying to do what's in their best interest
		- You can't effectively lead someone unless you love them.
		- > You don't necessarily need to like your boss. You might not be buddies. You might not choose to hang with them on the weekends. But you need to choose to love your boss. Loving your boss means you genuinely want what's best for them and you're trying to do what's in their best interest.
			- > Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. Philippians 2:3-4
				- Choose what's important to the other person as more important than what's important to you.
			- > Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, humbled himself by becoming obedient to deathâ€”even death on a cross!
			- **Be convinced that God put your boss in their position**
				- Whether you like your boss or not, God establishes authority.  **The more convinced of that God appointed authority over you, the more responsible you will be with how you challenge them.**
				- Knowing that God establishes authority will allows us to challenge up without the sense that you're challenging them as a person.
			- **To build trust, practice faithfulness.** When things aren't going well for someone, our instinct is to look for more weakness in that person to justify the judgment we made in our minds. When we are the victims of this, faithfulness can help turn things around. We can consistently deliver strong leadership in difficult situations,  identify and solve problems, and show devotion to our team
			- ** Don't bring up disagreements when emotions are running high.** We can bring up difficult conversations when tensions and consequences are low.
			- **Champion publicly. Challenge privately.**
				- Know that when we challenge someone publicly they are made to feel embarrassed, incompetent, or inadequate. This can ruin our relationship with them. It plants seeds of doubt in them not to trust you, that we're out to get them or for their job.
				- However, when we praise publicly. We build people up and give them a sense that we believe in them because we championed them publicly. When we praise others publicly it helps create strong relationships.
			- **Choose to trust your boss.** If we constantly dwell on how frustrated we are, we will go into our meetings feeling closed and negative. These negative feelings in turn leak out into our behaviors and words. Choosing to trust your boss helps build your relationship with them.
			- The most powerful reason to challenge the status quo is to make it better. Any other reason for change is counterproductive. But not everyone agrees what defines better. Make sure the benefits and the reason for change is clear to you that you're able to communicate this clearly to others.
				- Start with why. People don't  give buy-in to what you do, they buy why you do it. When we are challenging up, we're selling an idea. The clearer the why, the more they'll buy it.
			- Tailor your approach differently for each person. Declare your intentions first before challenging up.
			- Ask questions of curiosity and mean it. If we move to fast on decisions and choices, asking questions can help slow us down.
			- Give a positive feeling to your challenges of the status quo. How we challenge will determine how others feel about us.
- 10. Your Next Chapter Starts Today
	- Great leaders know how to lead when they're in charge because they've been leading long before they were ever given. One of the best things you can do today is to begin asking yourself questions about how and why you want to lead when you're in charge. Then start leading with those answers in mind.
		- **Regarding your reputation**
			- One of the most important question to ask yourself is: "What do you want people to say about you when you are finally in charge?"
			- Great leaders look ahead to the future and begin to act today to become who they want to be.
			- Our reputation matters now. It isn't built overnight. We are forming our reputation right now whether we're in charge or not.
		- __If we wait to start leading, we will never be put in a position to lead anyway__.
	- The total totem pole
		- The relationship between the person at the very top and the person at the very bottom of an organization tells you a lot about someone's leadership ability. Good leaders are viewed favorably by those closest to them in the company. Great leaders are viewed favorably by everyone in the company.
