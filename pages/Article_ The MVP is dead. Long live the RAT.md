	- There is a flaw at the heart of the term Minimum Viable Product: it’s not a product. It’s a way of testing whether you’ve found a problem worth solving. A way to reduce risk and quickly test your biggest assumption. Instead of building an [MVP](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/mvp) identify your __Riskiest Assumption__ and __Test__ it. Replacing your MVP with a RAT will save you a lot of pain.
	- MVP is used so much it’s lost its original meaning. It’s often mistakenly applied to the first release of a rudimentary product. As a result, the “MVP” ends up much more complex than the quick test it was supposed to be and far too shoddy for a released product.
	- Worried about a second-rate product, people call for Minimum __Valuable__ Products or Minimum __Lovable__ Products. This is going in completely the wrong direction, though. Leading you to make larger bets on riskier assumptions. Leaving it later and later to learn anything from real customers.
	- An MVP seduces with false reassurances of a clear, linear path to an optimized solution. The Riskiest Assumptions Test puts the focus on learning. The key to this is rapid, small tests. What's the smallest experiment you can do to test your biggest assumption? Maximize the rate of learning by minimizing the time to try things.
	- Identifying the underlying assumptions takes a lot of mental energy and discipline. Express the opportunity as a customer problem and work backwards. What has to be true for the opportunity to exist? Now take each of those assumptions and ask what are the main assumptions behind __them__? Repeat until you’re reached the root assumptions. This is similar to the [5 Whys](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi2hfG4rKvPAhWCWhoKHRyLBw0QFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2F5_Whys&usg=AFQjCNHk-Yyc9qUqyNM4U3eaQoENhzDN_A&sig2=tPvIBgLHA2qyUXs_dJy8Zw&bvm=bv.133700528,d.d2s). Working your way back up from the bottom identify evidence that supports each assumption. You should now have a clear idea of where the critical gaps in your knowledge are. A clear idea of what your __Riskiest Assumption Tests__ need to be.
	- Doing __Riskiest Assumption Tests__ in established companies comes with different challenges. Constraints of a start-up drive the frugal thinking that lends itself so well to RATs. With plentiful resources there appear to be fewer consequences committing to large projects before validating them. __Riskiest Assumption Tests__ require a different mindset. Dedicated engineers, designers and product managers can be their own worst enemy. Their professionalism pulling them towards perfected products. Leading to feature creep and polished code. But if no one needs your product then no one cares if it’s beautiful and has impeccable code quality.
	- __Riskiest Assumption Tests__ prioritize the key tasks required to validate your idea quickly. They remove the temptation of prematurely creating a rudimentary product. But they are not easy. You need to be relentless in your pursuit of them. Vigilant of scope increases. It is the responsibility of the whole team to continuously ask each other: “Is this the smallest thing we can do to test our riskiest assumption?”
