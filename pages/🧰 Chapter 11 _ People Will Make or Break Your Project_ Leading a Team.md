title: ðŸ§° Chapter 11 | People Will Make or Break Your Project: Leading a Team
---

- >  To bring a team in bringing an idea to reality, the project manager must:
- recruit the right teammates
- motivate them towards a vision
- lead 1:1 and team meetings
#.chapterdistillation

- This is perhaps the most important [[pro tip]] in project management:
	 - > As project managers, we need to own all the failures in the project. We never blame our teammates, especially when presenting to stakeholders.
		 - We need this mindset to truly own the project. Without ownership, we won't have power over our projects. Without power over our projects, we are setting ourselves up for failure.

		 - With this mindset of ownership, we will look at failures and think, "what could I have done?" instead of "who is responsible for this?," because we know we are responsible for everything.
			 - What if the mistake could be traced to one of our teammates? Then we need to trace it further back.
				 - Part of our job as project managers is to influence the mindset and skills of our teammates. Could we have prevented the mistake with training and better people management? Could we have mitigated the probability and impact of the risk, and prepared contingencies?
					 - If the mistake happened despite all these, we trace it further back. Could we have recruited better?
						 - Whatever that little voice in our heads that wants to blame others says, we always hold the trump card: we initiated the project or chose to accept the project.

							 - Never let anyone take away your responsibility for the project.

		 - > Project success, in contrast, is always attributed to the entire team, especially when presenting to stakeholders.

- In this chapter, we explore two aspects of project leadership:
	 - Getting the right people and ensuring they have the time and skills for their role in the project
id:: 6f39be7c-f2a2-4e9e-81ee-c2c3e8919e16

	 - Motivating your team and building a work culture
id:: d039433a-18a3-44ad-afe7-4af82595061a

- Many projects managers also execute work in the WBS on top of project management. Some project managers are their own sole resource for executing the WBS: they work solo. This chapter also applies in these cases. We also need to manage ourselves.

- ((6f39be7c-f2a2-4e9e-81ee-c2c3e8919e16))
	 - We have done the heavy lifting by creating our WBS and other project documents. We just need to look at them and ask ourselves what kinds of skills we need in the project and how much time is needed from the people with those skills.
		 - We can make use of other people's knowledge by doing 1:1 meetings and organizing workshops to get answers from them.

	 - [[Maximize your learning]]
		 - Look at [your WBS](((de4955b2-951b-476c-8b82-f69034814483))) (shift click to open in the right sidebar) and list down the skills you need for your project. Also estimate much of people's time you need for the project.
			 - 

		 - Doing this with the WBS is the 80/20, but if you have time to be more thorough, also look at your [Communications Plan](((2b8794de-be82-45cd-bb83-b43b0e8fbf6a))) and [Risk Register](((b6fff010-af08-43b5-a9e7-8c00bed70cd9))), and list additional skills you need.
			 - 

		 - If needed, do 1:1 calls or organize workshops with people who have experience in similar projects to help you answer the questions above.

		 - Who among your teammates could make or break the project? Focus management work on them (better selection, more 1:1 time, more training, backups).
			 - 

		 - If you have an existing team, check if there are skills gaps. You'll need to decide whether it is better to hire or to train.

		 - Whether you hire, train or both, these need to be considered in your project. Will you need to update your project scope and schedule for hiring and training? If so, you will need to add these to your project scope (ie, add them to the WBS).

	 - > Learning to hire and manage project teammates, whether part-time or full-time, opens up so many projects to you. You can move fast by working solo, but you also limit yourself to projects that have a scope and timeline that fits your skills and capacity.
		 - If you need a recruitment playbook, I recommend "Who: The A Method for Hiring" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. #.book-recommendation

		 - [[pro tip]] Changing the habits of your teammates usually requires a lot of work.

			 - Starting-off by recruiting well is a lot of upfront work, but it will save you a lot of time and headaches in the future.

- ((d039433a-18a3-44ad-afe7-4af82595061a))
	 - In this section, I share three mental models and two tools I found most useful in managing people in a project team.

	 - ((56f2fc3a-9a5a-4008-95e8-92e8ec1a8714))
		 - Leading a team is such a rich and multi-faceted craft that written explanations and graphical models tend to fall short in expressing it. The best way to learn about leadership is to see good leaders in action. In the written word, it is through stories. But the richest and most entertaining model of how to lead people I've seen is this [[TED Talk]] by [[Itay Talgam]], who uses famous conductors to show the principles of leadership and the styles of different leaders. Join me in watching and taking notes. Mine are [here](((45df75a1-509b-4891-af49-75152309c605))).
			 - {{video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9g3Q-qvtss}}
id:: 3a2f2da0-3668-46d9-8071-75e7b0e558e1
				 - From the perspective of project management, I'd like to highlight the following:
					 - There are five styles presented in the video. Some will feel more natural to us than others. As we grow as leaders, we expand our palette of leadership styles.

					 - Each leadership style has its place. The talk underlines the risks of [Riccardo Muti's domineering style of leadership](((9c1d8365-e852-44fd-a5aa-c57db15f26d1))). Sometimes, we have no choice but to impose our will on our team. This is due to constraints. Constraints can be external (deadlines, risks, budget, scope, the capabilities of the team) or internal (our ability as leaders). This is why [project selection and framing](((89645719-6259-4ef3-8701-e7cd6ca81f89))) and our growth as leaders are key factors to ourâ€”and our team'sâ€”success and enjoyment in our projects.
						 - Muti's style could also represent self-discipline. [It has its place](((51e04429-c980-4ad8-99e9-4d444d4e305b))), but if discipline is our only tool, our orchestra will walk-out at some point: burn-out.

						 - [Richard Strauss' by-the-book style of leadership](((734de6db-d5eb-42e9-a49c-f185339355b0))) is also a response to constraints. For instance, in projects with very tight regulatory constraints, there may be little room for creative expression of project team members.

					 - When we work with teammates with deep expertise and with whom we have strong relationships, [Herbert von Karajan's style](((ee412f85-8b87-48d9-ae0b-0fa9e950e1cb))) is open to us. We can focus on setting the vision and removing obstacles for our team, instead of trying to impose our will.

					 - I personally aspire to lead with [the style represented by Carlos Kleiber](((fb71b859-b5db-41b2-9e42-69bbd4de8ce1))) and [Leonard Bernstein](((f9ec0f7b-3371-450e-9eec-66cea83bfa8e))).
						 - [[Project managers need to be the chief storyteller of the team.]]
							 - Stories are powerful tools for motivation. As project managers, we have the comprehensive view of the project. We select from the strands of our work packages, risks, and the project vision, to weave a story for our team. 
id:: 371c4095-e3e7-41f1-9c6a-2eeae25b6b82
								 - The story's structure can simply be a hero on a journey to save a beautiful princess. And to do so, the hero needs to slay a dragon.
									 - In a project launch for instance, we highlight the goal and the purpose of the project (how beautiful the princess is). We also talk about the arduous journey (top-level WBS, risks, timeline), not in a fearful way, but as heroes with the special qualities to slay the dragon (introduce the team and why we are the right team for this project).

		 - [[outer limits of this model]]
			 - The limitation of the mental model presented by this video is that all these conductors lead from a position of power. Project managers often lead from a position with much less power. For instance:
				 - A young project manager leading a much more experienced team

				 - A project manager new to an organization leading a team with established relationships

				 - A non-technical project manager leading a team of experts in their fields

			 - [[pro tip]]
				 - Be clear about the work of project manager: not the boss but a professional in orchestrating expansive work[*](((357855da-4757-4f0e-9f9a-8d291bdd7d83)))

				 - Acknowledge and respect the expertise of your teammates

				 - Make sure you can access other people's power (eg, your project sponsors) just in case you need it[*](((61fed35a-46ec-4ebe-9356-2cb585d7977d)))

		 - [[Maximize your learning]]
			 - Among the five leadership styles presented in the video, which one is most natural to you?
				 - 

			 - Which one would you like to learn?
				 - 

			 - What could you try out in your projects to get hands-on experience in the leadership styles?
				 - 

	 - ((0ca18fa1-b448-404e-9b34-256c2e98b18e))
		 - {{embed  ((323de8fa-4def-4647-addb-cb96eb20dd87))}}

		 - I rely heavily on the [[Stallion\Rider]] model in [[ðŸ§° Chapter 12: Project-driven Stallion\Rider Productivity]]. In this current chapter, we use this model to create a plan to motivate our teammates.
			 - > **To sustain our team's enthusiasm for a project, we need to address both the Rider and the Stallion:**
- Their Riders need to see the purpose of the project, and be reminded of it throughout the project.
- Their Stallions need to experience recognition, camaraderie, novelty, adventure, and other motivating emotions, throughout the project.
				 - Storytelling is our main tool for helping our team see meaning and purpose of the project. [Our project charter is our outline for our pitch](((a359e1ad-1d13-45b2-81a2-990904a9dc12))), which we need to deliver and hone throughout the project. This is part of the job. [[Project managers need to be the chief storyteller of the team.]]
					 - Storytelling is not only for your team, but [for yourself](((a5d4c688-3cfa-49a6-8b74-e03eac64aab5))).

				 - For recognition, I create a private document with the following columns: 1) Achievement, 2) Reward. 
					 - I look at the most important work packages in the WBS and their owners, and think of a proportional reward for their achievement. Rewards could be as simple as thank you notes. These are your private notes. These are not a promises, but [options for positive reinforcement](((586d3bb8-f772-450d-9b67-c8bc273f50d0))).
						 - I've seen project managers who seem natural at this, and probably don't need to plan this way. I'm not a natural at this, so I need to use this tool to ensure I address this aspect of team motivation.

				 - A tactic I have been using in the past few years is to always start meetings with each one sharing "work wins" and "non-work news," and end it with "recommend something cool others could check out (films, books, music, apps, etc.)". Work wins is a way to start with a good vibe. Non-work news and sharing cool things are ways for remote teams to get to know each other despite the missing water cooler and casual lunch conversations.

				 - Project celebrations are important. At the very least, you need to plan for a celebratory atmosphere for the project launch and the project completion. For drawn-out projects, you'd also want to plan celebrations in key milestones.
					 - I'm terrible at this, so I usually assign this to a teammate who enjoys this kind of thing.

		 - [[Maximize your learning]]
			 - Apply what you learned by creating your own table of achievements and rewards
				 - 

			 - What customs could you adopt and what events could you include in your plan to help produce motivating emotions like recognition, camaraderie, novelty, adventure and and elevation of status?

id:: b5997135-a9c7-4074-b3ab-0d2bf93d9083
		 - This [[TED Talk]] by [[Daniel Pink]] is also a good one:
			 - {{video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvAUbU9Y}}
				 - My main takeaway from this talk is that we should design the experience of working in our project to enable the following:
					 - **Autonomy** - the urge to direct our own lives.
						 - Having clear ownership of [work packages](((3030e9f6-de72-49b3-bc22-c03687be3949))) and selecting an appropriate [work cycle length](((fe7598c1-0432-4678-ac68-291794c74169))) is one way to enable autonomy.
							 - Rather than just assigning work packages to my teammates, I find it useful to always ask them if they are okay to own those. Doing this in front of the team increases skin in the game. If I sense that there is a chance that the teammate might hesitate, I do a 1:1 first.

					 - **Mastery** - the desire to become better and better at something that matters.
						 - During the planning stage I find it helpful to do 1:1 meetings with each of my teammates and ask them what skills they would like to grow in while working on the project. I consider this when assigning tasks and roles.

					 - **Purpose**Â - the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.
						 - Aside from [storytelling](((371c4095-e3e7-41f1-9c6a-2eeae25b6b82))) and making use of the project charter to create and hone a project pitch, I find it helpful to hear how my teammate view the purpose of the project. I take note of these for internal project communications.
							 - Playing the long game of building a reputation, we'd want to close this loop at the completion of the project.
id:: 586d3bb8-f772-450d-9b67-c8bc273f50d0
								 - For mission-driven projects, we need to do our part in making our teammates feel that their contribution has been worthwhile. This could mean a thank you message at the end of the project or each phase of the project.

								 - For profit-driven projects, we need to do our part to make our teammates see their personal return-on-investment in the project. This could be as simple as a thank you message. Include their direct manager in the message. Highlight their achievements. In large organizations, this could mean going through the process for formal recognition.

			 - [[outer limits of this model]]
				 - In societies with less education and with greater emphasis on community, these three may not be the strongest motivators. Debts of honor, belongingness and patronage may be a better toolkit in leading a team. In these situations, a (good) feudal lord may be a better model than a modern business leader.

		 - To me, meeting each teammate one-on-one is the most important tool in people management. Here are some project management activities that can be done in 1:1 meetings, and some questions that you might find useful.
			 - [[Project planning]]
				 - Understand what motivates each of your teammates.
					 - __What would you like to learn in this project?__ (If it is not too intrusive, you could also dig deeper by asking why.)

					 - __Could you tell me about the best projects you were in and the worst ones? What made them good/bad?__

				 - Note work styles and communication preferences of your teammates.

				 - Work on your project documents, particularly in their areas of expertise (you can opt to do this as a team instead)
					 - Work packages in the WBS (__What needs to be done in your part of the project?__)

					 - Risks (__What went wrong in similar projects you've been involved in?__)

			 - [[Project execution]]
				 - [[Work cycle meetings]]
					 - For getting updates on work packages and shifting the focus on new ones, you'll need to choose between quick 1:1 meetings, one long team meeting, or shorter meetings with smaller groups.
						 - This depends on your style, and the collaboration needs of the project. Is there an advantage to getting everyone in the same meeting, or will it just be a waste of people's time?
							 - ((de924234-ee0c-4c63-aa30-73a91f76d275))

				 - Regular 1:1
					 - Whatever your update meeting style, you might want to consider scheduling regular 1:1 meetings with each teammate to continuously improve rapport, ensure that you catch potential issues early on, and get feedback on the way you're managing the project. Here's the agenda I have been using for the past few years:
						 - __Urgent matters__

						 - __Things we should continue doing in the project__

						 - __Things we need to improve on in the project__

				 - Quality checklists
					 - In some projects, like events, all your preparation converges in a few days or a few hours. In these cases, you'd want to help your future self and your team at those moments by preparing quality checklists.
						 - I do this by sitting down with each teammate and looking at our WBS. We create a list of items that we will review at critical times (eg, prior to the big event and at the beginning of that day). Here are some examples from [that conference I organized in a university](((251f2934-7424-4f2d-aea0-8811114c86fc))).
							 - {{pdf  https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamfu%2F8gwt32wzED.pdf?alt=media&token=71cf4cd8-7bd7-46b5-ba38-7f9e5497106f}}

			 - [[Project/phase closing]]
				 - You'd want to capture lessons learned at the end of a project or a phase. This is best done as a team, but it may be useful to add this in your 1:1 agenda, to capture lessons that your teammate may be hesitant in sharing in a team setting.

id:: b36234bb-a223-4c79-a77a-976161f1e088
		 - [[Project planning]]
			 - The key team meetings during project planning are the creation of the following project documents. You would want to do a draft yourself, and get your team's input after. You need to choose whether to do this 1:1, as a team, or both.
				 - [WBS]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 5 | The Heart of Project Management: The WBS]])

				 - [RBS and Risk Register]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 8 | How to Not Fail: The RBS and The Risk Register]])

				 - [Project Charter]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 6 | Aligning Your Stakeholders, Your Team and Your Future Selves: The Project Charter]])

				 - [Communications Plan]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 7 | Get Support, Get Work Done and Get Lucky: Stakeholder Communications]])

				 - [Project Schedule]([[ðŸ§° Chapter 10 | Schedule Management = Focus Management]])

		 - [[Project execution]]
			 - Project launch
				 - You start project execution with a **project launch or kick-off**.
					 - The objective is to align with your stakeholders, especially your project team on the following:
						 - What you are doing.

						 - Why you are doing it.

						 - How you will do it (WBS, Risks, how you will communicate, ground rules).

					 - This is essentially a presentation and discussion of your project charter.

					 - The project kick-off is also a time for team introductions. You can opt to do team building activities. You'd want the vibe to be professional, festive and energetic. 

			 - [[Work cycle meetings]]
id:: ca0d3c1c-e5e5-420a-b85d-77021e022757
				 - You'll need to choose how you will manage work cycles: 1:1 meetings, multiple small meetings of sub-teams, or a meeting with the entire team. Observe how things go and adjust as needed.
					 - ((de924234-ee0c-4c63-aa30-73a91f76d275))

				 - [[pro tip]]: assigning a teammate to take notes might sound like a power move. You actually lose power by not owning the note-taking in meetings. Owning the narrative lets you frame issues the right way and influence the focus of work cycles.
					 - Will you present issues as burning platforms to energize your team, or are they distractions from more important matters?

					 - Always note down decisions and next steps, with their owners, and other tags that might help your future self (eg, to add to your WBS, RBS).

				 - You'll need to decide on an agenda.
					 - > The main goal of your agenda is to help your team (and yourself) focus on what needs to get done in the upcoming work cycle, and who needs to do what. You can zoom in the relevant section of your project schedule or filter your WBS.

					 - ((d7ccce52-e076-4b2f-ae0c-a048f5a263b4))

					 - You'll also need to decide if or when to include the following
						 - Risk monitoring
id:: 87a39f8b-140e-4e62-9a36-4c3024dd2bfb

						 - Issue log review
id:: 3a1a4186-7917-4f41-9910-c868d088bc00

					 - **((87a39f8b-140e-4e62-9a36-4c3024dd2bfb))**
						 - If you have completed the exercises in [[ðŸ§° Chapter 8 | How to Not Fail: The RBS and The Risk Register]], you will have scored your risks in terms of probability x impact. You can make use of date linked references to assign their review to your future selves.
id:: 231636ce-052c-4189-b22e-25e0f0f6602b
							 - For instance, if your work cycle is weekly and you meet your team on Mondays, you can indent your #s9 risk query under the Mondays of your project duration, and your #s6 risks every last Monday, so that the queries appears in the linked references of your Daily Notes Page when those days arrive.
								 - [[July 26th, 2021]] [[August 2nd, 2021]] [[August 9th, 2021]] [[August 16th, 2021]] [[August 23rd, 2021]] [[August 30th, 2021]]

							 - There are other ways of sending tasks to your future selves in Roam (eg, Delta). Just use whatever you are most comfortable with.

							 - If you use a calendar app, this can also be done as a repeating entry.

					 - **((3a1a4186-7917-4f41-9910-c868d088bc00))**
						 - You would also want to review open issues.
							 - In Roam, you could tag issue blocks with something #[[issue log]], its owner, its status (#open or #closed) its category and its priority, so you could use queries to bring up and filter open issues during meetings.
								 - The advantage of using Roam are the notes for the issues. There are many ways to do this, but I would indent my notes under block references of the the issue blocks, inside Daily Notes Pages.

							 - If you use a spreadsheet, you can create columns for owner, status, category and priority. Notetaking for each issue is a mess if done in a spreadsheet though.

				 - Finally, you'd want to cover the basics of running a meeting well. Here's a list I got from Rita Mulcahy's PMP Exam Prep book when I was studying for the PMP exam back in 2007, and which I have been using ever since. #.book-recommendation
					 - Did I set a time limit and am I keeping it?

					 - Did I schedule recurring meetings in advance?

					 - Do I meet the team regularly, but not too often?

					 - Do I have an explicit purpose for each meeting?

					 - Do I create an agenda with team input?

					 - Do I distribute the agenda beforehand?

					 - Do we stick to the agenda?

					 - Do I let people know their responsibilities in advance?

					 - Am I bringing the right people together?

					 - Do I chair and lead the meeting with a set of rules?

					 - Do I assign deliverables and time limits for all work that results from meetings?

					 - Do I document and publish meeting minutes?

		 - [[Project/phase closing]]
			 - Considering the [[Stallion\Rider]] framework, we would want to do the following:
				 - **Celebrate the completion of the project**
					 - You would want to recognize people's achievements in front of the entire team.
						 - In the context of a company, this recognition should reach the people who have the power to promote or reward your teammates.

				 - **Document lessons learned and collect project documents for your future use**
					 - The could be a separate meeting.

					 - Do your future selves a favor and update your project documents with what you missed during your project (eg, work packages in the WBS and risks in the RBS).

					 - Here's an example of a lessons learned form using top branches from a WBS, which I distributed to my teammates during a workshop.

- [[Next chapter]]
	 - [[Work brings ideas to reality]]. Most of us do both project management work and the work of getting work packages done. Getting the work packages we own done is the craft of productivity or task management. Getting Things Done (GTD) is today's prevailing task management system. GTD, however, does not work for everyone. In the next chapter, I share a non-GTD system that has worked for me: [[ðŸ§° Chapter 12: Project-driven Stallion\Rider Productivity]]
