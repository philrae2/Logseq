- Note:
	 - People are in a balancing act between blending in our environment and also striving to be seen as special in as society motivated by [[capitalism]] and older societal frameworks that promote status roles and hierarchy.
		 - There is a dichotomy in society that promotes succeeding as group but can also culturally motivate individual group member to seek distinction. 

		 - For example, as a low status worker, we are not considered special compared to our managers or the CEO of the company
			 - We strive to climb the corporate ladder to seek the higher status in order to feel special, to be seen by the rest of our peers
				 - We work harder, longer, and sacrifice aspects of our lives to chase these roles

		 - We are [motivated]([[motivation]]) by the attention we receive from society 
			 - Society in turn [manipulates]([[manipulation]]) us by defining the how much status a role has in relation to others

			 - Status roles benefits those in higher positions 

	 - These feelings of wanting to be special is a source of significant influence on our daily behaviors. Are we aware of the extent which outside societal pressures is manipulating our behaviors? Are we truly in control of our missions and [[purpose]] in life? #manipulation
