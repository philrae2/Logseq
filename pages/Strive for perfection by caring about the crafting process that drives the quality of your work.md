- **Note:**
	- Sometimes we can be tempted into laziness and let our bar for quality sink. Don't make this a habit but instead keep working to perfect your craft and output.
	- We should care about making great products and quality work, not the rewards that come from it.
	- The artist mindset doesn't care about the money but takes pleasure in the process of craftsmanship.
