title: ðŸ§° Chapter 6 | Aligning Your Stakeholders, Your Team and Your Future Selves: The Project Charter
---

- > The Project Charter is a tool for you to:
- align the work need to complete a project across your team, across time
- draft your pitch for the project
- protect yourself and your teammates in low-trust project environments

- [[Work brings ideas to reality]].
	 - To be brought to reality, some ideas require deep work from one individual. Other ideas require the orchestration of varied types of work across individuals, across time.[*](((293f5d41-cbc7-450a-bf09-cf7d19d936a8))) Project management is that orchestration.
		 - The starting point of that orchestration is a shared vision, reason and pathway:
			 - A shared vision of the outcome of the project

			 - A shared reason for doing the project

			 - A shared pathway toward the project outcome

		 - That starting point is the **project charter**.

- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamfu%2FMhjrdLjiQk.png?alt=media&token=17881b93-0ca6-4d2d-adeb-9efdd5e49666)

- It is unfortunate that project charters can be seen as just one more requirement imposed by an organization. Like the other project management tools, the process of creating a project charter is more important than the resulting document. By creating one, project managers:
	 - Clarify what the vision of the project isâ€”for themselves, for their teammates and for their stakeholders.

	 - Draft the pitch for the project (because [[90% of a project manager's work is communication]]) 

	 - Increase skin in the game for those involved in the project

	 - Protect themselves and their team, especially in [low-trust project environments](((9c35ee12-988f-4e9e-a241-1dcd09ba1b97)))

- Most organizations have templates for project charters (or proposals). I suggest that you create a template for yourself, one that makes sense to you. This allows you to go through a familiar thought process both for projects for yourself and for organizations with formal project management processes.
	 - In this chapter, we will focus on the purpose of each section of the project charter, you could create your own template.

- In general, project charters just have three sections:
	 - What this project is
id:: de21cee3-1577-4d77-86c0-3543f77a2fdb

	 - Why we are doing this project
id:: c710f442-73e5-4613-b18b-e8c41b402b88

	 - How we will bring this project to reality
id:: e2f89ddf-11fa-432d-9e50-4d080945f252

- ((de21cee3-1577-4d77-86c0-3543f77a2fdb))
	 - The purpose of creating this section is to create an alignment with your team and stakeholdersâ€”as well as your future selvesâ€”on what you are working on. Creating a project charter removes the risk of stakeholders expecting a project different from the the one you are actually working on.

	 - The top section of the document is the **project name**. You don't need to go all-out on branding. Just make the project easy to talk about. If your project requires you to persuade people to contribute to your project (e.g., volunteer work or donations), you might need to put in more effort to come up with a name that helps you pitch your project.

	 - Next is a description of the project, or the **project scope statement**. John F. Kennedy's project scope statement for the Apollo mission is a classic example of a good project scope statement:
		 - > "I believe that this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth."
			 - This is a good project statement because:
				 - It has a due date: before the decade is out

				 - It has a measurable outcome: landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth

			 - This project statement is good also because of what it does not say: the cost. This implies that among the **triple constraint** of scope, schedule and cost, the first two are the priorities (i.e., the US is willing to spend to hit these scope and schedule targets).
				 - You also need to choose your prioritization within the triple constraint and agree on this with your team and stakeholders. Project management always involves tradeoffs. Agreeing at the beginning on the relative importance between scope, time and cost will spare you headaches as you progress in the project.
					 - I use this template to agree on and document the relative importance among the triple constraint of a project:
						 - {{[[table]]}}
id:: 56c31dc8-7685-4151-b4c0-39710429aa60
							 - **__Relative flexibility__**
								 - **Least flexible**
									 - 
										 - **Most flexible**

							 - Scope
								 - TODO
									 - TODO
										 - TODO

							 - Cost
								 - TODO
									 - TODO
										 - TODO

							 - Schedule
								 - TODO
									 - TODO
										 - TODO

						 - See an example from an actual project [here]([[[[P: RESOLVED Crowdfunding]] Project Charter]]).

			 - A project need not have a precise outcome. In fact, committing to very [[S.M.A.R.T.]] outcomes could hurt the project: it caps your upside.
				 - In [low-trust project environments](((9c35ee12-988f-4e9e-a241-1dcd09ba1b97))), you need to precisely document project scope to protect both the stakeholders (from under-delivery) and the project team (from scope creep).

				 - In high-trust project environments, your project scope can be made open to unexpected good luck and flexible to change. More on this in [[ðŸ§° Chapter 9 | Designing Serendipity: How to Systematically Get Lucky]].

	 - Now that we are in agreement and we have documented what project we are doing, let's agree on why we are doing this project. This helps you motivate yourself and your team across the timespan of the project.

	 - To bring out the best work from yourself and your team let's use the [[Stallion\Rider]] model (which we will explore in detail [here](((a551a675-7e4b-4c2e-9a16-8f3dfe447eb0)))). You need to address two aspects of motivation:
		 - The Stallion: emotional motivations

		 - The Rider: motivations stemming from purpose

	 - The Stallion is motivated by status, novelty, adventure, camaraderie, etc. You have lived with your self for a while. What projects in the past motivated you at a deep emotional level? Why do you think you were so motivated? How can you create the same motivation in your project?
		 - Get to know your teammates, or more precisely, their Stallions. What excites them?

	 - The Rider is motivated by purpose.
		 - What is the mission of the organization you are leading this project for? How does this project contribute to that mission. In project proposal templates of businesses, this is the "business case" section. The bottom line is the return-on-investment of the project.

		 - If it is a personal project, what vision of your life is this project bringing you closer to? It is also good to answer this question even for projects you are hired to manage. What is the impact of this project's success to your career? Why is career advancement important?

	 - > **Note:** you don't need to present all of these in your publicly-shared project charter, but it is good to answer these questions to help you manage yourself and your team.

	 - If your teammates are knowledge workers, another way to view this is to ask how the project increases their autonomy and mastery, and how it gives them purpose. We will go deeper into this in [this section](((b5997135-a9c7-4074-b3ab-0d2bf93d9083))) of [[ðŸ§° Chapter 11 | People Will Make or Break Your Project: Leading a Team]].

	 - [[Maximize your learning]]
		 - Write down why you are doing this project, addressing both the Stallion and the Rider
			 - 

		 - Create a "business case" or "alignment to mission" section for publicly-shared charters
			 -

	 - This section is a sketch of the output from the other project management tools we will use. We agree with our team and stakeholders on the general contours of the journey of this project:
		 - What will be the work needed to bring this project to reality? **Top level WBS**.

		 - Who are we relying on to bring this project to reality? **Teammates and sponsors.**

		 - How will this project unfold over time? **Project milestones.**

		 - What could make this project fail and how do we address them? **Top risks and responses.**

		 - How much will this project cost? **High level budget.**

	 - Top level WBS
		 - Look at your output from [[ðŸ§° Chapter 5 | The Heart of Project Management: The WBS]]. What are the top level blocks of its branches? If you will share this charter publicly, will these top level blocks give the reader an idea of the work required to make this project happen?

	 - Teammates and sponsors
		 - As a planning document, you want a list of people you can rely on to do the project work, get you what you need, and remove obstacles for you.

		 - Your project team does the work in your WBS. Your project sponsors provide you your project budget as well as political air cover.

		 - The public version of your project charter can be used to ensure that stakeholders, including your teammates, have skin in the game. You want them to share both in the upside and the downside of the projectâ€”the financial and emotional rewards of success and the possible pain and embarrassment of failure.

	 - Top risks and responses
		 - Based on our exercise in [[ðŸ§° Chapter 5 | The Heart of Project Management: The WBS]], what are your top risks in the project?
			 - How will you mitigate those risks (i.e., how will you lessen their impact and probability)?

			 - What are your contingencies? If those risks unravel, what will you do?

		 - > Practice judgement on whether to include this in the document you share, or how much risks to include. Organizations unused to risk management might find this section alarming.

		 - We will do more detailed risk management in the chapter [[ðŸ§° Chapter 8 | How to Not Fail: The RBS and The Risk Register]].

	 - High level budget
		 - In a company, where you usually need someone's approval for the release of funds, this section could be where you document that approval.

		 - Look at the your initial WBS from [[ðŸ§° Chapter 5 | The Heart of Project Management: The WBS]]. What branches require some money? What is your estimate of their costs?

		 - Ask project managers who have done a similar project in the past. How much did their projects cost?

	 - [[Maximize your learning]]
		 - Add top level items from your WBS to your project charter for the purpose of giving the reader an idea of what needs to be done to complete the project.
			 - 

		 - Write down the names of people whose help you need to make the project successful. Add these names and their roles in a section of the project charter.
			 - 

		 - List down some project milestones and their target dates in your project charter.
			 - 

		 - List down your top risks and how you plan to address them.
			 - 

		 - Write down your high level budget.

- Using the Creation of the Project Charter to Align Your Team
	 - The creation of the project charter is an opportunity to bring together your team towards one vision.
		 - Do a [1:1](((b769f0e9-3c42-4db8-ba7b-caf91a025d70))) with each of your project members and key stakeholders. What do they want out of this project? What do you need from them in this project?

		 - Seeing their influence in the envisioning of the project, documented in the project charter, will make your team feel more ownership in the project. Involving your team in naming the project also contributes to this.

- The project charter as a pitch document
id:: a359e1ad-1d13-45b2-81a2-990904a9dc12
	 - The project manager is the main salesperson of the project. Even if your project does not involve other people, you need to convince your future selves to persevere in executing this project.
		 - Story and emotion is important for motivating your team and yourself (specifically, your Stallion).

	 - For projects that require the work of a team or the support of stakeholders, your project charter is your sales script. Why should they spend their time and money on the project?

- The the project charter's role in formal and low-trust environments
id:: 9c35ee12-988f-4e9e-a241-1dcd09ba1b97
	 - In companies with formal project approval processes, you will need to fill out project proposal templates. If you create a charter with a template you created for yourself, this will just mean copying some sections and editing them for approvers.

	 - > Note that in companies with a formal project management process, the project charter is issued by the project sponsor, even if the project manager writes it. You are essentially anointed to make use of money and people's time to get the project done.

	 - In low-trust environments (eg, one-time contracts between companies), the project charter could act as an agreement between parties involved, and could be the draft of a contract.
		 - You might want to add an **Assumptions** section when operating in a low-trust environment. Place there what you need from different stakeholders to ensure that the project would be a success. Also use the Risk section to give you and your team some protection.

- Examples
	 - Here are some recent project charters I have made:
		 - Project charters I created for myself:
			 - [Project Charter for RESOLVED Crowdfunding]([[[[P: RESOLVED Crowdfunding]] Project Charter]])

			 - [Project Charter for the weekly Zoom calls with the Believers of this rBook]([[[[P: Professional PM for Believers]] Project Charter]])

		 - Project charters I created for others:
			 - For funding application using an organization's template: [Project Accessible Genomics Grant Application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19qv8RqGuv5xKMhYpnWGIwqQbSzX5VJmQnoN-1L8bqas/edit#)

			 - A template for aligning roles with a partner organization: [UNIVCebu Bootcamp Project Charter Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NBZ3QMxWA6ijl77VCBNAQmJF7ShWjAwJarXL5gGdumY/edit#heading=h.h4uono6k1hgl)

		 - You can also do a web search and look for a format that fits your goals.
