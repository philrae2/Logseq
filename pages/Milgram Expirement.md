title: Milgram Expirement
---

- A study on how far people will obey authority even if it harms others

- The study had a fake "learner" role and a Teacher role.

- The authority figure, the study principal, would ask the Teacher to shock the learner if they gave wrong responses to the questions. Each shock voltage would increase if the learner progressively gets questions wrong.

- The result was that even when the learners would beg and scream in pain for the teacher to stop, the teachers would continue delivering shocks due to their deferment to the authority of the study principal (authority)
