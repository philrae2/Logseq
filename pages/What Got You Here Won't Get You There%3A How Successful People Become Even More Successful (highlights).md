	- But I can’t and I don’t. Instead, I show these people what their colleagues at work *really* think of them. It’s called feedback. It’s the only tool I need to show people, “You Are Here.” And in this book, I will show you how to wield that weapon on yourself and others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbqbbfeg9cpvf9f2wmqbg5f))
		- **Note**: What are methods to get feedback from our peers, clients, and others?
	- My job is to help them—to identify a personal habit that’s annoying their coworkers and to help them eliminate it—so that they retain their value to the organization. My job is to make them see that the skills and habits that have taken them this far might not be the right skills and habits to take them further.
	  
	  What got them here won’t get them there. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbrqbdx6tfn90ncfhk0j63b))
	- First, I solicit “360-degree feedback” from their colleagues—as many as I can talk to up, down, and sideways in the chain of command, often including family members—for a comprehensive assessment of their strengths and weaknesses.
	  
	  Then I confront them with what everybody really thinks about them. Assuming that they accept this information, agree that they have room to improve, and commit to changing that behavior, then I show them how to do it.
	  
	  I help them *apologize* to everyone affected by their flawed behavior (because it’s the only way to erase the negative baggage associated with our prior actions) and ask the same people for help in getting better.
	  
	  I help them *advertise* their efforts to get better because you have to tell people that you’re trying to change; they won’t notice it on their own.
	  
	  Then I help them *follow up* religiously every month or so with their colleagues because it’s the only honest way to find out how you’re doing and it also reminds people that you’re still trying.
	  
	  As an integral part of this follow-up process, I teach people to *listen without prejudice* to what their colleagues, family members, and friends are saying—that is, listen without interrupting or arguing.
	  
	  I also show them that the only proper response to whatever they hear is *gratitude*. That is, I teach them how to say “Thank you” without ruining the gesture or embellishing it. I am a huge apostle for thanking.
	  
	  Finally, I teach them the miracle of *feedforward*, which is my “special sauce” methodology for eliciting advice from people on what they can do to get better in the future ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbrrxxfds8d7rtkqq298deq))
	- No matter how good they are, whether they sport a 30 handicap or play to scratch, *they all want to get better.* That’s why they’re always practicing, scheduling lessons, trying out new equipment, fiddling with their swing, and poring over instructional advice in magazines and books.
	  
	  That’s the spirit underlying this book. It’s aimed at anyone *who wants to get better*—at work, at home, or any other venue ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbrtmzjyt2t5rbspt0pz0yb))
	- all of us in the workplace delude ourselves about our achievements, our status, and our contributions. We
	  
	  •  Overestimate our contribution to a project
	  
	  •  Take credit, partial or complete, for successes that truly belong to others
	  
	  •  Have an elevated opinion of our professional skills and our standing among our peers
	  
	  •  Conveniently ignore the costly failures and time-consuming dead-ends we have created
	  
	  •  Exaggerate our projects’ impact on net profits because we discount the real and hidden costs built into them (the costs are someone else’s problems; the success is ours) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbrvwmtcrthhsj9x6kx8wtx))
	- Successful people consistently compare themselves favorably to their peers. If you ask successful professionals to rate themselves against their peers (as I have done with more than 50,000 people in my training programs), 80 to 85 percent of them will rate themselves in the top 20 percent of their peer group—and 70 percent will rate themselves in the top 10 percent. This number goes even higher among professionals with higher perceived social status, such as physicians, pilots, and investment bankers, 90 percent of whom place themselves in the top 10 percent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbs2yr1eytwfv4qdp5zbvwt))
	- Successful people believe that they have the capability within themselves to make desirable things happen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbs3kevy7bgh0b423gn6jn4))
	- We tend to believe that success is “earned” through an individual’s motivation and ability (even when it is not). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbs826ym3rs2e9e5394zhnm))
	- Successful people, however, believe there is always a link between what they have done and how far they have come—even when no link exists. It’s delusional, but it is also empowering ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbs8e3h20d7qzjh071n75xp))
	- One of the greatest mistakes of successful people is the assumption, “I am successful. I behave this way. Therefore, I must be successful *because* I behave this way!” The challenge is to make them see that sometimes they are successful *in spite of* this behavior. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbsafzdt4cpc5vd0dh3rc89))
	- Successful people have a unique distaste for feeling controlled or manipulated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbsf3f7n81hme17dyf6xe9c))
	- *cognitive dissonance*. It refers to the disconnect between what we believe in our minds and what we experience or see in reality. The underlying theory is simple. The more we are committed to believing that something is true, the less likely we are to believe that its opposite is true, even in the face of clear evidence that shows we are wrong. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbsg650dzz6rrdrwearmm7n))
	- Yet cognitive dissonance actually works in favor of successful people when they apply it to themselves. The more we are committed to believing that something is true, the less likely we are to believe that its opposite is true, even in the face of evidence that shows we may have chosen the wrong path. It’s the reason successful people don’t buckle and waver when times get tough. Their commitment to their goals and beliefs allows them to view reality through rose-tinted glasses. That’s a good thing in many situations. Their personal commitment encourages people to “stay the course” and to not give up when the going gets tough ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbsgxye3t26xf7zx477x4kc))
	- What applies to disparate parts of a giant company also applies to disparate people in an organization. You can’t force people to work together. You can’t mandate synergy. You can’t manufacture harmony, whether it’s between two people or two divisions. You also can’t order people to change their thinking or behavior. The only law that applies is natural law ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcf5vmq4z4fajsfrfmjsdeh))
	- The only natural law I’ve witnessed in three decades of observing successful people’s efforts to become more successful is this: *People will do something*—*including changing their behavior*—*only if it can be demonstrated that doing so is in their own best interests as defined by their own values* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcf6bysevtzwqj7s14d4efr))
	- when you take self-volition out of the equation and forces beyond your control are involved, natural law applies. In order for me to get you to do what I want, I have to prove that doing so will benefit you in some way, immediately or somewhere down the road. This is natural law. Every choice, big or small, is a risk-reward decision where your bottom-line thinking is, “What’s in it for me?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcf7685cjgd7v9mvrxg77na))
	- Most people’s resistance to change can be overcome by invoking natural law. Everyone, even the biggest ego in the room, has a hot button that can be pushed—and that button is self-interest. All we have to do is find it. It’s not the same thing in all people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcfdfftk0x07e0zng4zcj3h))
	- successful people make it easy to find the button. If you press people to identify the motives behind their self-interest it usually boils down to four items: money, power, status, and popularity. These are the standard payoffs for success. It’s why we will claw and scratch for a raise (money), for a promotion (power), for a bigger title and office (status). It’s why so many of us have a burning need to be liked by everyone (popularity). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcfe6vy6mvjfdhk3hhef1pg))
	- Take a look around you at work. Why are you there? What keeps you coming back day after day? Is it any of the big four—money, power, status, popularity—or is it something deeper and more subtle that has developed over time? If you know what matters to you, it’s easier to commit to change. If you can’t identify what matters to you, you won’t know when it’s being threatened. And in my experience, people only change their ways when what they truly value is threatened. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3qszkk6e5tdtbhzdgvrkp1))
	- We spend a lot of time teaching leaders what to do. We don’t spend enough time teaching leaders what to stop. Half the leaders I have met don’t need to learn what to do. They need to learn what to stop.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3qtmtwkkfzxbc1mtsch78t))
	- When was the last retreat or training session you attended that was titled, *Stupid Things Our Top People Do That We Need to Stop Doing Now*? When was the last time your CEO delivered an internal talk, designed to motivate employees, that focused on his negative traits and his efforts to stop this destructive behavior? Can you even imagine your CEO (or immediate supervisor) admitting a personal failing in public and outlining his efforts to stop doing it? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3qvd6dacpfj715nnxky5ff))
	- Get out your notepad. Instead of your usual “To Do” list, start your “To Stop” list. By the end of this book, your list may grow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3r162nm27yszfvyy2ykgbr))
	- We have to stop couching all our behavior in terms of positive or negative. Not all behavior is good or bad. Some of it is simply *neutral*. Neither good nor bad ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3r6rs2j3rh9apeepdk63x5))
	- Fortunately, there’s a simpler way to achieve the goal of “being nicer.” All you have to do is “stop being a jerk.” It doesn’t require much. You don’t have to think of new ways to be nicer to people. You don’t have to design daily tasks to make over your personality. You don’t have to remember to say nice things and hand out compliments and tell the little white lies that lubricate the gears of the workplace. All you have to do is . . . nothing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3r6fa2cm5sp9efja1nqq56))
	- When someone offers a less-than-brilliant idea in a meeting, don’t criticize it. Say nothing.
	  
	  When someone challenges one of your decisions, don’t argue with them or make excuses. Quietly consider it and say nothing.
	  
	  When someone makes a helpful suggestion, don’t remind them that you already knew that. Thank them and say nothing.
	  
	  This is not a semantic game. The beauty of knowing what to stop—of achieving this state of inspired neutrality—is that *it is so easy to do*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3r66g15vjj4ejkzmfdf185))
	- **1. Winning too much:** The need to win at all costs and in all situations—when it matters, when it doesn’t, and when it’s totally beside the point.
	  
	  **2. Adding too much value:** The overwhelming desire to add our two cents to every discussion.
	  
	  **3. Passing judgment:** The need to rate others and impose our standards on them.
	  
	  **4. Making destructive comments:** The needless sarcasms and cutting remarks that we think make us sound sharp and witty.
	  
	  **5. Starting with “No,” “But,” or “However”:** The overuse of these negative qualifiers which secretly say to everyone, “I’m right. You’re wrong.”
	  
	  **6. Telling the world how smart we are:** The need to show people we’re smarter than they think we are.
	  
	  **7. Speaking when angry:** Using emotional volatility as a management tool.
	  
	  **8. Negativity, or “Let me explain why that won’t work”:** The need to share our negative thoughts even when we weren’t asked.
	  
	  **9. Withholding information:** The refusal to share information in order to maintain an advantage over others.
	  
	  **10. Failing to give proper recognition:** The inability to praise and reward.
	  
	  **11. Claiming credit that we don’t deserve:** The most annoying way to overestimate our contribution to any success.
	  
	  **12. Making excuses:** The need to reposition our annoying behavior as a permanent fixture so people excuse us for it.
	  
	  **13. Clinging to the past:** The need to deflect blame away from ourselves and onto events and people from our past; a subset of blaming everyone else.
	  
	  **14. Playing favorites:** Failing to see that we are treating someone unfairly.
	  
	  **15. Refusing to express regret:** The inability to take responsibility for our actions, admit we’re wrong, or recognize how our actions affect others.
	  
	  **16. Not listening:** The most passive-aggressive form of disrespect for colleagues.
	  
	  **17. Failing to express gratitude:** The most basic form of bad manners.
	  
	  **18. Punishing the messenger:** The misguided need to attack the innocent who are usually only trying to help us.
	  
	  **19. Passing the buck:** The need to blame everyone but ourselves.
	  
	  **20. An excessive need to be “me”:** Exalting our faults as virtues simply because they’re who we are ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3r99v4cn43sd3131j9nvh2))
	- There’s a reason I devote so much energy to identifying interpersonal challenges in successful people. It’s because the higher you go, the more your problems are behavioral.
	  
	  At the higher levels of organizational life, all the leading players are technically skilled. They’re all smart. They’re all up to date on the technical aspects of their job. You don’t get to be, say, your company’s chief financial officer without knowing how to count, how to read a balance sheet, and how to handle money prudently.
	  
	  That’s why behavioral issues become so important at the upper rungs of the corporate ladder. All other things being equal, your people skills (or lack of them) become more pronounced the higher up you go. In fact, even when all other things are *not* equal, your people skills often make the difference in how high you go. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3rgc6qkz2c6e4smnxp6vk1))
	- If we argue too much, it’s because we want our view to prevail over everyone else (i.e., it’s all about winning).
	  
	  If we’re guilty of putting down other people, it’s our stealthy way of positioning them beneath us (again, winning).
	  
	  If we ignore people, again it’s about winning—by making them fade away.
	  
	  If we withhold information, it’s to give ourselves an edge over others.
	  
	  If we play favorites, it’s to win over allies and give “our side” an advantage. And so on. So many things we do to annoy people stem from needlessly trying to be the alpha male (or female) in any situation—i.e., the winner ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3rnsbpnr36crxk0p79w95m))
	- But the higher up you go in the organization, the more you need to make other people winners and not make it about winning yourself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3s7n6yb1dvtw9a7yysns0k))
	- For bosses this means closely monitoring how you hand out encouragement. If you find yourself saying, “Great idea,” and then dropping the other shoe with a tempering “but” or “however,” try cutting your response off at “idea.” Even better, before you speak, take a breath and ask yourself if what you’re about to say is worth it. One of my clients, who’s now the CEO of a major pharmaceutical, said that once he got into the habit of taking a breath before he talked, he realized that at least half of what he was going to say wasn’t worth saying. Even though he believed he could add value, he realized he had more to gain by not winning ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3s89ehes1eebqqz7tksja1))
	- As for employees who have to bear the brunt of their boss’s need to add value, be confident about your expertise, and, short of being insubordinate, stick to your position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3s8nc968a0hyrddxs28096))
	- People don’t like to be critiqued, however obliquely. That’s why passing judgment is one of the more insidious ways we push people away and hold ourselves back from greater success. The only sure thing that comes out of passing judgment on people’s efforts to help is that they won’t help us again. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3sj34bjt10wmdchket9ck7))
	- You need to extend that same attitude—the doctor’s mission-neutral purpose—to dealing with people trying to help you. And here I am not referring only to the people who are trying to help you change. You are not allowed to judge any helpful comment offered by a colleague or friend or family member. No matter what you privately think of the suggestion, you must keep your thoughts to yourself, hear the person out, and say, “Thank you.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3tn4nhd2yshvgsygcjmxby))
	- Try this: For one week treat every idea that comes your way from another person with complete neutrality. Think of yourself as a human Switzerland. Don’t take sides. Don’t express an opinion. Don’t judge the comment. If you find yourself constitutionally incapable of just saying “Thank you,” make it an innocuous, “Thanks, I hadn’t considered that.” Or, “Thanks. You’ve given me something to think about.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3tnfvkts246es2e8evns4a))
	- You can apply a similar test to help you avoid destructive comments. Before speaking, ask yourself:
	  
	  1. Will this comment help our customers?
	  
	  2. Will this comment help our company?
	  
	  3. Will this comment help the person I’m talking to?
	  
	  4. Will this comment help the person I’m talking about? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3v11sb1vvm0m070fhy1frz))
	- Stop trying to defend your position and start monitoring how many times you begin remarks with “no,” “but,” or “however.” Pay extra-close attention to those moments when you use these words in sentences whose ostensible purpose is *agreement* with what the other party is saying. For example, “That’s true, however . . .” (Meaning: You don’t think it’s true at all.) Or the particularly common opener, “Yes, but . . .” (Meaning: Prepare to be contradicted.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz3v90jzs295dv9grke8sgmd))
	- Habit #7 Speaking when angry ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz51dk70870e1rsk1qhqm28h))
	- But the worst thing about anger is how it stifles our ability to change. Once you get a reputation for emotional volatility, you are branded for life ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz51e3pwtzp7pg72mn34rnhj))
	- If you keep your mouth shut, no one can ever know how you really feel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz51j1gpgxzp8wr0f0aww4am))
	- Habit #8 Negativity, or “Let me explain why that won’t work.”
	  
	  We all know negative people—or what my wife calls “negatrons”—in the workplace. They’re the people who are constitutionally incapable of saying something positive or complimentary to any of your suggestions. Negativity is their default response. You could walk into their office with the cure for cancer and the first words out of their mouth would be, “Let me explain why that won’t work.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz51p4zq85e5mr8543dcgg5k))
	- If negativity is your flaw, my first impulse would be to have you monitor your statements the moment someone offers you a helpful suggestion. If you’ve read this far, you know that I firmly believe that paying attention to *what we say* is a great indicator of what we’re doing to turn people off. If you catch yourself frequently saying, “Let me tell you why that won’t work,” you know what needs fixing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzc89naethq3tp2xrz6fw5zs))
		- **Note**: People may start to leave you out of progress update meeting.
	- How often do they come to you with helpful suggestions—without you having to ask?
	  
	  How often do they knock on your door and sit down to shoot the breeze or give you a heads-up about a development that may affect you?
	  
	  How does the floor traffic around your desk compare with other colleagues? Are you a popular item, or are you beginning to gather dust on the shelf? If you get even the vaguest sense that there is an imaginary “Do Not Enter” sign outside your office, you’ve just become a little smarter about what you must change.
	  
	  When the issue is negativity, I prefer this form of observational feedback to mere monitoring of speech patterns. Checking what you say doesn’t automatically tell you what other people think of you. You may be overly negative, but your colleagues may be capable of living with it. But seeing how people relate to you provides proof that *your flaw is serious,* that it matters to people, that it’s a problem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzc8c8f9tmaygcj4ctcy2qed))
	- This is a sibling of withholding information. In withholding your recognition of another person’s contribution to a team’s success, you are not only sowing injustice and treating people unfairly but you are depriving people of the emotional payoff that comes with success. They cannot revel in the success or accept congratulations—because you have choked off that option. Instead they feel forgotten, ignored, pushed to the side. And they resent you for it. If you really want to tick people off, don’t recognize their contributions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzcj8cwc2danazh3cjwq02va))
	- In depriving people of recognition, you are depriving them of closure. And we all need closure in any interpersonal transaction. Closure comes in many forms—from the emotional complexity of paying our last respects to loved ones before they die to something as pro forma as saying, “You’re welcome” when someone else says, “Thank you.” Either way, we expect closure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzcj8smhnxyn27j8c4t4c5wx))
	- Note the aggressive use of the first person singular pronoun. It’s a hallmark of successful people; they become great *achievers* because of their intense focus on themselves. *Their* career, *their* performance, *their* progress, *their* needs. But there’s a difference between being an achiever and a leader. Successful people become great *leaders* when they learn to shift the focus from themselves to others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzcj9xv39a14t3w7fw0fq32h))
	- Habit #16 Not listening
	  
	  This is certainly one of the most common complaints I hear in my professional life. People will tolerate all sorts of rudeness, but the inability to pay attention holds a special place in their hearts—perhaps because it’s something all of us should be able to do with ease. After all, what’s it take to keep our ears open, our eyes looking at whoever’s talking, and our mouths shut?
	  
	  When you fail at listening you’re sending out an armada of negative messages. You’re saying:
	  
	  •  I don’t care about you.
	  
	  •  I don’t understand you.
	  
	  •  You’re wrong.
	  
	  •  You’re stupid.
	  
	  •  You’re wasting my time.
	  
	  •  All of the above. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzcgymjjswe40jjmtjz33m22))
	- What’s needed is a slight tweak in our mindset for accepting other people’s comments. My friend Chris Cappy, an expert in executive learning, has a saying that put this into perspective for me. No matter what someone tells him, he accepts it by reminding himself, “I won’t learn less.” What that means is when somebody makes a suggestion or gives you ideas, you’re either going to *learn more* or *learn nothing*. But you’re not going to *learn less*. Hearing people out does not make you dumber. So, thank them for trying to help.
	  
	  If you examine the alternative, you’ll see that almost any response to a suggestion other than “thank you” has the potential to stir up trouble. Intentionally or not, you appear as if you are attacking the person talking to you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzcj17k3kt71kndfsb5qra52))
	- Gratitude is a skill that we can never display too often. And yet for some reason, we are cheap and chary with gratitude—as if it were rare Bordeaux wine that we can serve only on special occasions. Gratitude is not a limited resource, nor is it costly. It is as abundant as air. We breathe it in but forget to exhale. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzcj3eqnrb2469h59cchhw83))
	- When someone gives us something that has a huge potential benefit and costs absolutely nothing, there’s only one adequate response: “Thank you!” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzcj5yqpfk653tjrejnaqkg9))
	- The irony, of course, is that infallibility is a myth. No one expects us to be right all the time. But when we’re wrong, they certainly expect us to own up to it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzehxr1nzcb5rtv8vkwz82tq))
	- The journalist/novelist Tom Wolfe has a theory he calls *information compulsion*. He says that people have an overwhelming need to tell you something that you don’t know, even when it’s not in their best interest. Journalists would have a hard time surviving without information compulsion. People wouldn’t call them with tips on a good story, or agree to be interviewed, or spill secrets about their company, or hand out delicious quotes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzetz33rmyefgz4czd8y7w3x))
	- Study the twenty annoying habits and you’ll see that at least half of them are rooted in information compulsion. When we add value, or pass judgment, or make destructive comments, or announce that we “already knew that,” or explain “why that won’t work” we are compulsively sharing information. We’re telling people something they don’t know. We’re convinced that we’re making people smarter or inspiring them to do better, when we’re more likely to achieve the opposite effect. Likewise, when we fail to give recognition, or claim credit we don’t deserve, or refuse to apologize, or don’t express our gratitude, we are withholding information ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzetzpjqm56wp27ncp9r2ah9))
	- It’s commonly called 360-degree feedback, because it is solicited from everybody at all levels of the organization. Until something better comes along, confidential 360-degree feedback is the best way for successful people to identify what they need to improve in their relationships at work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzhkmdg8zhgkwc3e8v8m2f7y))
	- Each interview lasts about an hour and focuses on the basics: What is my client doing right, what does my client need to change, and how my (already successful) client can get even better ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzhkwyc5qxxseatzyqv6znrt))
	- In soliciting feedback for yourself, the only question that works—the only one!—must be phrased like this: “How can I do better?”
	  
	  Semantic variations are permitted, such as, “What can I do to be a better partner at home?” or, “What can I do to be a better colleague at work?” or, “What can I do to be a better leader of this group?” It varies with the circumstances. But you get the idea. Pure unadulterated issue-free feedback that makes change possible has to (a) solicit advice rather than criticism, (b) be directed towards the future rather than obsessed with the negative past, and (c) be couched in a way that suggests you will act on it; that in fact you are trying to do better.

	- These five examples of observed feedback are stealth techniques to make you pay closer attention to the world around you.
	  
	  When you make a list of people’s comments about you and rank them as negative or positive, you’re tuning in the world with two new weapons: Judgment and purpose.
	  
	  When you turn off the sound, you’re increasing your sensitivity to others by counterintuitively eliminating the precious sense of hearing.
	  
	  When you try the sentence completion technique, you’re using retrograde analysis—that is, seeing the end result and then identifiying the skill you’ll need to achieve it.
	  
	  When you challenge the accuracy of your self-aggrandizing remarks, you’re flipping your world upside down—and seeing that you’re no different from anyone else.
	  
	  Finally, when you check out how your behavior is working at home, you realize not only what you need to change but why it matters so much.
	  
	  The logic behind these drills is simple: If you can see your world in a new way, perhaps you can see yourself anew as well. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gznrf5sq1a0q9j6m2z7jcxz5))
