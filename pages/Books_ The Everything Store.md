	- Jeff Bezos is often lauded for his great decision-making skills but he actually made a lot of mistakes and failures, often costly, that could have been preventable if he listened to the people around him. Did the lessons learned from those experiences been acquired without that experience through listening to others around him or research or theorizing?

	- Amazon wasn't built by Jeff alone but rather the smarter and talented people he recruited along the way to solve specific, targeted problems that he, Jeff, himself did not have

- Prologue
	- About Jeff Bezos "He's a classic technical founder of a business, who understands every detail and cares about it more than anyone."

	- A plaque in Amazon's headquarters reads "There is so much stuff that has yet to be invented. There's so much new that's going to happen. People don't have any idea how impactful the Internet is going to be and that this is still Day 1 in such a big way.
	- Jeff believes Amazon is successful because they are

		- Genuinely customer centric
		- long-term oriented
		- Genuinely like to invent
	- #[[narrative fallacy]] Humans are biologically inclined to turn complex realities into oversimplified stories as a short cut to simple understanding of reality. Taleb proposes that the human brain is limited and we tend to convert unrelated facts and events into cause-and-effect relationships into understandable stories.
		- The false narrative blinds us to the true complexities, randomness, luck and chaos of human experience.

- Chapter 1 - Faith
	- Jeff worked for DESCO a private trading company employing mathematicians and software engineers to take advantage of the stock market to run their trades. For example if there was a price difference between US and European or other markets stock price for the same stock.
	- In working for a startup from Columbia professors called Fitel, Jeff Bezos was described as __unconcerned about what other people were thinking.__
	  id:: a5fe650c-12cb-4261-977a-464418231005
	- Jeff Bezos admired Alan Kay,  computer pioneer, and often quoted "point of view is worth 80 IQ points"â€”a reminder that looking at things in new ways can enhance our understanding
	- #[[Critical Thinking]] #rethinking Jeff Bezos was a quick rethinker who wasn't married to his beliefs, quickly abandoning notions and embraced new better ideas. He carried a notebook jotting down his ideas.

- Chapter 3
	- Amazon spent millions in dot.com businesses that burned down in flames, thinking they had enough bandwidth to manage them while not tending to their own strength and business
	- Jeff had to be persuaded to cut down on growth and focus on profitability based on financial forecasts (though he often did not trust forecasting), though this was looking forward decades into the future
		- Amazon also made mistakes in hiring new executive manager Galli from Black and Decker who inflamed Amazon employees
- Chapter 4 - Milliravi
	- Amazon had a very customer centric framework
	- After the dot.com bust, Jeff Bezos had to cool down his growth centric mindset and growth ideas, that were obviously failures (buying all kinds of toys instead of only buying the toys that were the most popular)
	- Amazon Marketplace upset everyone because it created lower priced used goods exposure in the pages of the new suppliers' page. Jeff didn't care because he was focused on giving the customer as much choice as possible even if it made his suppliers irate
	- The editorial team that brought personalization and recommendations to customers home page was replaced a computer algorithm based on data and statistics
- Chapter 5
	- Jeff Bezos amassed wealth do accomplish his dreams of going into space. This goal started all the way back to his childhood and high school where he had his valedictorian speech which lofty goals
	- Setback are temporary. Naysayers are best ignored.
	- Jeff Bezos is motivated by being people counting on him. "I like being counted on"
- Chapter 6
	- To help solve the distribution problems created by Walmart hires for Amazon, Jeff Wilke was tapped to modernize the system to accommodate the small orders of Amazon not the big warehouse distribution of Walmart.
	- #communication #[[group problem solving]] **The need for more communication is a sign of dysfunction. It means people aren't working together in a close, organic way. We should be trying to figure out a way for teams to communicate less with each other, not more.**  (Is this true? Jeff Bezos had executive meetings all the time with his managers. Where is this proposition applicable?)
		- #decentralization Coordination among employees wasted time, and that the people closest to the problems were usually in the best position to solve them.
		- Microsoft employed a top-down management approach with layers of middle managers, a system that slowed decisions and stifled innovation.
		- Amazon fired middle managers, Jeff wanted independent teams who were entrepreneurial saying that autonomous working units are good, things to manage working units are bad.
			- However, this is most useful for software development where the process to develop a solution was chaotic. Independent teams may not be needed for processes that have little variability and is repetitive.
	- #processes Amazon determined that their fulfillment centers were using a process used in warehouses and distribution centers that solved large orders, and not the small custom orders Amazon dealt with. Amazon decided that they have to reinvent the process and build a custom solution tailored specifically to their problem
	- #PowerPoint #communication Jeff Bezos believed that PowerPoint concealed lazy thinking. Jeff Holden said that, "PowerPoint is a very imprecise communication mechanism, it is fantastically easy to hide between bullet points. You are never forced to express your thoughts completely"
	- In solving the problems of adding a new category to the Amazon store like toys or jewelry, Jeff would choose people who didn't have any experience on
		- Jewelry was difficult to solve for Amazon and was only modestly successful. Jeff had thought his vision for lower prices for everything was generalizable to everything but it was not. Amazon would turn its attention to apparel and other categories in the future
	- When faced with business problems Jeff Bezos felt that you can invent your way out of it #innovation
	- Amazon Web Services is the business of selling basic computer infrastructure like databases, storage, and raw computing power
		- Companies like Instagram, Pinterest and even Netflix use AWS
		- AWS was influenced by the book Creation by Steve Grand. Grand wrote about primitives which sere simple computational building blocksâ€”storage, messaging, bandwidth.
	- #[[Problem Solving]] Amazon took the idea to break its infrastructure down into the smallest, simplest atomic components and allow developers to freely access them with as much flexibility as possible.

	- Mechanical Turk came about as another service outside of Amazon's retail services. It was developed by one of its acquisitions and brought in internally after it folded.
	- Jeff Bezos believed pricing the AWS services below cost for the long term and to detract rivals from copying their services. He liked the high prices of the iPhone as a magnet for competition
- Chapter 8 - Fiona
	- The iPod catapulted Apple as the go to for purchasing music. Amazon was feared that Apple too would would eat away at their books business. In response Amazon started the development of the Kindle.
		- Creating an e-reader hardware internally was not core competency at Amazon. Jeff Bezos had to hire his away to acquire the talent.
		- Jeff also believed in [[single-threaded]] leadership and took away the physical books manager Steve Kessel to solely manage the digital books initiative
			- This idea was born from Clayton Christensen's book The innovator's Dilemma. He wrote that great companies fail not because they want to avoid disruptive change but because they are reluctant to embrace promising new markets that might undermine their traditional businesses and that do not appear to satisfy their short-term growth requirements.
				- The companies that solved the Inventor's dilemma succeed when they "set up autonomous organizations charged with building new and independent business around disruptive technologies."
- Chapter 9 - Lift off
	- Jeff Bezos hired a personal coach to be less of an asshole.
	- Dalzell comments on Jeff as, "He embraces the truth. A lot of people talk about the truth, but they don't engage their decision-making around the best truth at the time." #rethinking

		- He is not tethered by conventional thinking. He views everything as an open discussion.

	- #invention Every major company faces decisions over whether it should build or buy new capabilities. Amazon almost always prefers to build it. This is after their failure to merge many acquisitions in the 1990s.
		- The book [[Books: Good to Great]] counseled companies to only acquire other firms when they had mastered their virtuous circles, and the "as an accelerator of flywheel momentum, not a creator of it."
	- Amazon tries to buy Zappos, who has better relationships with their clothing suppliers by launching endless.com to put pressure on them. Eventually, after some time and economic pressure, Zappos sold to Amazon.
		- Jeff recorded an 8-minute video to the Zappos employee: "When given the choice of obsessing over competitors or obsessing over customers, we always obsess over customers. We pay attention to what our competitors do but it's not where we put our energy."
	- Regarding [[books]] and [[media]] [[gatekeeper]]s, Jeff said that even well meaning gatekeepers slow innovation. Gatekeepers like book publishers slow down innovation by subjectively choosing who gets published or not. Amazon wanted to provide a surplus of creativity and let the consumers decide who was worth their time.
