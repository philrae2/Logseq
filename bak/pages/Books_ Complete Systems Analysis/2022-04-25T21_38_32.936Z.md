		- Build models that are faithful reproduction of the current business
			- Define the boundaries
			- Develop a context diagram
		- Analyzing the stored data of a system helps you get a better understanding of the system. That's why early in the Project, you'll build a data model.
		- After the data model, you'll need to begin the data dictionary, and then expand your context diagram by building lower-level physical models.
		- After building the models we can then start looking at the essential requirements.

		- 2.1 Analysis Models
			- Also called a working model of a system.
			- How do you understand systems?

				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FgNfUp5EZNh.png?alt=media&token=352874a2-183e-4a1c-b69d-a82dcf26e936)
				- Understanding a large and complex system is difficult. This can only be done by controlling the amount of information you take in at a time.
					- Start with the large components first and then start breaking down or subdividing the large components to smaller pieces
					- The tactic of breaking large systems into progressively smaller components sounds wise, but we must ensure that we produce useful components.
						- When we divide a system, the resulting components must have some relationship to how the system works.
						- A component is functional if it can be easily and informatively named
						- If a component can be named using a verb and an object it is a function.
							- Example: __Select ambush locations__ is a component, while __processes beginning with "m"__
								- Functional components need less data than do nonfunctional ones. The data for Select Ambush Locations are reasonable while a modern system with any process called Processes beginning with "M" would have an absurdly large number of data flows, and as result , be meaningless to users. While functional -+
					- The best partitioning is the one that makes a system's interfaces as narrow as possible
					- We can also tell a lot about the functionality of a process by inspecting its interfaces—the data flows that enter and leave it. These flows should carry as little data as possible, and thereby make narrow interfaces.
					- The natural joints in the system are along the narrowest interfaces, or where you find a narrow flow of data with two processes. If you try to divide the system by pulling apart functions, you'll get messy interfaces. By partitioning where you find the data interface at its narrowest you'll deliver a model with functional components that are easy for the users to recognize.
		- 2.2 Data Flow Diagrams
		  collapsed:: true
			- When we are describing systems we need to consider they are multidimensional, meaning there are many components functioning simultaneously and independently acting out different behaviors. This means we can't describe this system in a one-dimensional medium, such as words, the nature of the tool would impose a serial order on the process of the system.
			- A multidimensional or graphic tool, such as a picture, provides a way of representing parts of the system without imposing an artificial order.
			- The data flow diagram is more than just a passive map of the system. It is also a working model because all of its components work int he same manner as the real system. In other words, the data flow in the model imitate the movement of data in the real system, and the model's processes use the same input as the real life system to produce the same output data.

				- __A data flow diagram is a working model of a system. In this system of the Nelson Buzzcott Employment Agency, the arrows represent the flow of data into and out of the processes (shown as bubbles). The data stores (indicated by parallel lines) hold data for later reference.__ Applicants here is considered a terminator.
				- This is a working model of an employment agency system. For it to work correctly, each processing component in the system must be able to produce its outputs from its inputs. So each of the processes must receive enough data by way of the incoming data flows and data stores to construct the outgoing data flows. This convention is known as the Rule of Data Conservation.
				- Once you have proved that every bubble can produce its output from its inputs, then you can be sure that the data flow diagram is a working model of the system being studied.
			- Terminator - Terminators provide the data for the system to process. They also receive data when the system has finished with the data. A terminator is a person, department, system, company, machine, and so on that exists outside the system being studied.
				- A terminator is outside the system. It interacts with the system by giving data to, or receiving data from, the system. Applicants from the figure above is an example of a terminator. Think of it as another system to which your system has a data connection.
			- Data flow is a roadway for data. 
			  collapsed:: true
				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2F6JUwkxoyzW.png?alt=media&token=2e455e95-b778-42a5-ad20-0c81ab864d23)
			- Data dictionary is where you define the data items that make up the data flow.
				- _Applicant Registration = Applicant Name + Applicant Address + Date OfBirth + Skills + Employment History_
			- A process transforms the incoming data flows into the outgoing flows.
			- Data stores are show in the data flow diagram by a pair of parallel lines with the store's name's between them.
			- Sometimes, the process is too large and complicated to write a mini specification. In that case, think of the process as a lower-level mini system. Instead of writing a specification, you draw another data flow diagram showing the details of the process. If the processes of the lower-level diagram are still too complex, each of them in turn becomes the subject of yet a lower-level diagram. This decomposition process continues until each piece is small enough to be specified in a one-page mini specification. This technique is known as leveling.
			- Context Diagram
			  collapsed:: true
				- The context diagram defines the boundaries of the system being studied by showing how it connects to the outside world. It is largely built before you begin to break the system into its functional pieces.
				- The context diagram shows how the system under study connects to the systems around it. It is these connections, or boundary data flows, that tell you the precise scope of your study. You use the context diagram to demonstrate the scope of the systems analysis to your users.
					- Without an agreed context, there is no way of telling if the correct system is being analyzed. There is no real place to start the analysis, and no real place to stop.
				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2F2q129S7Jf3.png?alt=media&token=0d26eb26-1417-45ad-8a1e-87c9134fd707){:height 413, :width 621}
					- **__Figure 2.2.12:__** __The context diagram for the Nelson Buzzcott Employment Agency system. Here you declare that you do not intend to study how CLIENTS react to a REQUEST FOR INTERVIEW. Similarly, the processes of the APPLICANTS are not the concern of the analysis study. The context diagram states that the study will begin and end with the flows to and from the terminators.__
					- The context diagram is a data flow diagram, but it differs in that all the system's processes are all collected into one bubble. The context diagram must include the anticipated automated system and the surrounding manual tasks.

			- Exercise: FastBuck
			  collapsed:: true
				- The FastBuck Book Company was formed a few years ago as a partnership between a failed bookmaker, a snake oil seller, and the nephew of a mob chief. Despite police attention, the company has managed to remain in business for a number of years.
				- Here’s how the company does business: Orders are sent in on coupons that customers clip from magazines such as __Slug Lovers’ Monthly__and __The Gravel Journal.__ (The company tends to advertise in magazines with a readership profile showing high gullibility.) Naturally, this is a cash-only business. Any orders received without payment are discarded.
				- The company doesn’t actually publish books. It simply has a supply of different covers. The appropriate cover for each order is glued to the generic book, which is sent to the hapless customer. Long-standing customers may receive several copies of the generic book with different covers. This is regarded by FastBuck as a hazard of being a customer.
				- The generic book was written in 1908 by a prominent bore. It rambles over such a wide range of topics that it is almost impossible for customers to complain of irrelevance. The book is also so stunningly soporific that it is doubtful anyone has ever read it. Complaints are few at FastBuck, and those that do arrive are ignored.
				- Repeat customers are in for a special treat at FastBuck. Those who attempt to deal with the company on more than one occasion are thought to be naive enough to fall for anything. An invoice for the previously ordered book is generated and sent in the hope that the customer will pay the invoice, even though cash arrived with the original order.
				- Benedict Shady is an analyst who had an unfortunate relationship with the daughter of one of the partners—unfortunate because the daughter is now in a delicate condition, and doubly unfortunate because her father is the one with mob connections. In return for not being thrown off the Brooklyn Bridge, Benedict has agreed to do an analysis of the business.
				- Benedict is presumably a better lover than analyst. His model is shown in [Figure 2.2.15](javascript:void%280%29). Write down all the errors that you can find in Benedict’s model, then compare your list with the one in [Chapter 4.2](javascript:void%280%29).
				- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FT35eDsCyE0.png?alt=media&token=3e643878-f892-40fa-9008-52c95de4b56b)
					- You were asked to list the errors you found in the model of the FastBuck Book Company ([Figure 2.2.15](javascript:void%280%29)).
					- Process 1 PROCESS ORDER doesn’t appear to do anything. This is a very poor name for a bubble, and its vagueness suggests that the analyst is rather unsure about just exactly what is happening. The solution to this problem is to write a coherent description of the bubble. If you cannot, then you should de-bubble it.
					- There is no rejection flow from this bubble, but recall we were told that it rejects orders without payment.
					- Process 2 GENERATE BOOK has no output. All functions must produce something. In this case, a BOOK would be the most likely output.
					- Both the data stores being accessed by this function are read-only. There is no source of input. This suggests an everlasting fountain of data, which needs no maintenance and has no data added to it. Read-only or write-only data stores must be investigated further (as should the dealings of the FastBuck Book Company, but that’s a job for someone else).
					- SEND PHONY INVOICE TO REPEAT CUSTOMER has no way of knowing that the incoming order is to a repeat customer. To know this, the system needs access to a data store of previous orders.
				- Corrected Process Flow ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2FK-lp1_5vp1.png?alt=media&token=33ec1aea-6844-4ef3-b077-1ec0d0fcfae2)
					- In this model, note that we have added an ORDERS FILE so that the process CHECK ORDER can tell whether an incoming order is a repeat order from a customer. The process also stores all orders.
					- Both the data stores in the previous model were read-only. Process 5 puts material into the SUPPLY OF COVERS store. We are guessing that the book covers come from a printer. Since we are even less sure where the generic books come from and since the people who run this company are very tight-lipped on this one, we have left it as a question mark.
					- The last paragraph was a joke, but the point of it is that when you are unsure of something, the best approach is always to put down your best guess. Put a large question mark beside it to indicate that you are guessing, and to remind yourself to ask the users.
					- The question mark beside process 6 is there because we don’t know if the company wants us to study this part of the operation. It also looks suspicious because the way we have drawn it, the company appears only to advertise “books” it has in stock. We think this company is not above advertising books that it does not have.
			- Exercise: The government Research Paper Clearing House
				- The federal government maintains the Government Research Paper Clearing House for unclassified research and development papers. The Clearing House sends scientific research papers to any citizen who asks for them. So that citizens know what is available, indexes of recently published papers are sent out each month.
				- Citizens may request to be added to the subscribers list for no charge and, upon being added, will be sent all the indexes currently on file.
				- For a fee, a citizen can request to have the full paper sent to him. This request must first be checked to see that the citizen is a subscriber and the index is correct, then the paper is sent. The invoicing for this service is handled by the Accounting Office.
				- The procedure for mailing has been in place for some years. When a paper is requested, the clearing house generates an address label with a tear-off strip identifying the paper to be sent. Each weekday evening, an order for the required papers is sent to the Papers Store. The store sends the papers the following morning, and the Clearing House workers match the papers to the labels and ship them. The tear-off portion of the label is discarded before shipping.
				- The indexes are maintained and shipped by the Index Department. This department is run by two women who use personal computers to maintain their list of subscribers. They are also responsible for shipping the indexes to subscribers. The women do their jobs very well. In fact, they have won awards several times for their efficiency.
				- Draw a context diagram for the activities of the Government Research Paper Clearing House. Remember that a context diagram has only one bubble to represent all of the system you intend to study. Remember also that the data flows around the boundary of the system are the most important element of your diagram.
				- There is no right answer to this exercise, for there can be no right context diagram until you talk to the users and all the other people who have an interest in the system. We cannot transport you to the Clearing House, but we can give you some alternatives, and some observations.
					- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2Ft6qfBR7hom.png?alt=media&token=757bdd84-d078-4353-9a74-48fbaa30d06d)
						- First, some technical observations: All of the data flows in your diagram should be named, and the names recognizable to the system users. The name of each terminator should reflect its role. From a mechanical point of view, context diagrams are reasonably simple. However, before proceeding, take time to ensure that all the notation on your diagram is correct.
						- The ADVICE OF NEW R&D flow was not specifically mentioned, but the Clearing House must have some way of knowing what papers are available for requests. The other flows in the diagram are referenced in the problem statement.
						- You were given details of the processing done by the Clearing House, but for the moment you hide these details inside the context bubble. Later you can break them out; the task here is to define the scope of the problem.
						- You may well have come up with a different solution to that given in [Figure 4.2.2]. For example, you were told that the Accounting Office handles the invoicing. Although you may feel it wise to study the way that the office produces the invoices, doing so implies that the Clearing House also must look after the receipt of payments, as well as the dunning of customers who fail to pay on time. In this case, you’ll have to add data flows such as PAYMENT and DUNNING LETTER to the context diagram. Alternatively, the Accounting Office may have no desire for you to study this part of its activities, in which case you must show the ACCOUNTING OFFICE as a terminator. As all the accounting activity will take place inside this terminator, there can be no INVOICE flow from the context to the CITIZENS terminator, but there must be a flow to advise the ACCOUNTING OFFICE of the charges. [Figure 4.2.3] shows this arrangement.
					- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2Fx70yT8elVq.png?alt=media&token=e182ded8-130c-4c04-b3af-e2341f7167a1)
						- **__Figure 4.2.3:__** __An alternative context diagram. The Accounting Office and Index Department are now outside the scope of the study, along with the Papers Store.__
						- The Index Department may also be outside the scope of your study. The two women who run it are adamant that you are not to study their activities, and that their efficiency awards mean that the job is being done as well as possible, and that there is no reason to try to improve it. This decision does mean that the subscribers’ list is maintained in two places; the Clearing House has to keep an up-to-date list and advise the Index Department of new subscribers to update its list. Now you can remove the indexes from your diagram, because the Index Department sends the index packet directly to the citizen. Note that it is incorrect to show a data flow between terminators.
						- As we said, there is no one right answer, but either of these diagrams gives you a starting point to raise questions with the users. Take a moment to reconcile the data flows in our diagram with yours.
						- When you are satisfied with your grasp of the drawing conventions, and with your answer versus the alternatives presented here, it’s time for some more work.
		- 2.3 A variety of viewpoints
			- [[Systems analysis]] is the craft of understanding systems by building models of them. Viewpoints are the way that systems analysts can conquer the complexity and size of today's systems.
			- Viewpoints necessarily distorted views of the reality being represented.
				- Viewpoints allows the analysts to build models that include only as much information as they need to see. This doesn't mean that models are a false representation of the system. It does mean the models are more usable because they show the analyst needs at the time, and such models don't burden analysts with details that can be delayed or show in another model.
			- A well-known example of justified distortion are subway maps
