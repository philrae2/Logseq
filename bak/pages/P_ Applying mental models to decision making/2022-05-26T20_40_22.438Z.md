	 - Awareness of your type of [[listening]] and communication
		 - [[Listening positions]]

		 - [[Reductive Listening]]

		 - [[Expansive Listening]]

	 - Awareness of types of thinking
		 - [[system 1 thinking]]

		 - [[System 2 thinking]]

	 - Before working on the problem.
		 - ((8c925feb-3bf4-485d-8d30-69e680b6314e))

		 - Use the [[Article: Decision Matrix]] to decide if you should spend time on this problem

		 - Validate and check your existing knowledge

		 - Don't make [[decisions]] based only on one point of reference or single piece of information. 
			 - If u have [[time]] use [[[[multidisciplinary]] thinking]] and gather multiple sources of data to inform your choice

			 - Consider and list all the perspectives to view the defined problem

		 - Remove your bias, assumptions, and false expectations #[[B: Judgment in Managerial Decision Making]]

		 - [[Define the problem]]
			 - [[Ask the right questions]]

			 - View the problem in a [[multidisciplinary]] fashion

			 - Identify the type of problem

			 - Make sure everyone who is asked to solve the problem agrees with the definition of the problem/task

			 - Are you solving or answering the correct question?

			 - Can you ask or define the problem/question better
				 - Use different perspectives to view the question

		 - Collect, gain consensus and define the goal(s)

		 - Validate and confirm the truthiness of your information

		 - Consider your own biases and assumptions
			 - Get rid of them

			 - What abstractions or "maps" or frameworks are we automatically defaulting to

		 - Consider your [[Circle of Competence]]
			 - Did you reach out to someone to help you define the problem or get a different perspective?

	 - After defining the problem or question, refine
		 - Can you simplify the question or break the problem down to smaller pieces

		 - Is the question/problem part of a bigger whole?

		 - ^^Apply the problem, criteria, alternative solutions with the following mental models to compute the optimal decision^^

		 - Apply Socratic Thinking

		 - Apply the Five Whys

		 - Apply [[Second-Order Thinking]]
			 - Think beyond the initial decision and its immediate effects, further into the subsequent downstream effects

			 - Consider and prepare for what type of questions may arise from the decisions/solutions proposed

			 - Think holistically of the system(s) affected by the proposed solution

			 - Consider and compare the long-term gains vs the short-term gains

			 - Is there a better solution further down the road that you aren't seeing?

		 - Consider the probabilities of the consequences from application of the Second-Order Thinking ([[Probabilistic Thinking]])
			 - Consider if the effect is normally distributed vs fat-tail distributes
				 - Prepare or prevent depending on the distribution

		 - Can you [invert]([[Inversion]]) the question or problem
