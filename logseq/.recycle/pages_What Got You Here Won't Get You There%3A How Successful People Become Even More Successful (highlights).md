	- But I can’t and I don’t. Instead, I show these people what their colleagues at work *really* think of them. It’s called feedback. It’s the only tool I need to show people, “You Are Here.” And in this book, I will show you how to wield that weapon on yourself and others.

		- **Note**: What are methods to get feedback from our peers, clients, and others?

	- My job is to help them—to identify a personal habit that’s annoying their coworkers and to help them eliminate it—so that they retain their value to the organization. My job is to make them see that the skills and habits that have taken them this far might not be the right skills and habits to take them further.
	  
	  What got them here won’t get them there. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbrqbdx6tfn90ncfhk0j63b))
	- First, I solicit “360-degree feedback” from their colleagues—as many as I can talk to up, down, and sideways in the chain of command, often including family members—for a comprehensive assessment of their strengths and weaknesses.
	  
	  Then I confront them with what everybody really thinks about them. Assuming that they accept this information, agree that they have room to improve, and commit to changing that behavior, then I show them how to do it.
	  
	  I help them *apologize* to everyone affected by their flawed behavior (because it’s the only way to erase the negative baggage associated with our prior actions) and ask the same people for help in getting better.
	  
	  I help them *advertise* their efforts to get better because you have to tell people that you’re trying to change; they won’t notice it on their own.
	  
	  Then I help them *follow up* religiously every month or so with their colleagues because it’s the only honest way to find out how you’re doing and it also reminds people that you’re still trying.
	  
	  As an integral part of this follow-up process, I teach people to *listen without prejudice* to what their colleagues, family members, and friends are saying—that is, listen without interrupting or arguing.
	  
	  I also show them that the only proper response to whatever they hear is *gratitude*. That is, I teach them how to say “Thank you” without ruining the gesture or embellishing it. I am a huge apostle for thanking.
	  
	  Finally, I teach them the miracle of *feedforward*, which is my “special sauce” methodology for eliciting advice from people on what they can do to get better in the future ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbrrxxfds8d7rtkqq298deq))
	- No matter how good they are, whether they sport a 30 handicap or play to scratch, *they all want to get better.* That’s why they’re always practicing, scheduling lessons, trying out new equipment, fiddling with their swing, and poring over instructional advice in magazines and books.
	  
	  That’s the spirit underlying this book. It’s aimed at anyone *who wants to get better*—at work, at home, or any other venue ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbrtmzjyt2t5rbspt0pz0yb))
	- all of us in the workplace delude ourselves about our achievements, our status, and our contributions. We
	  
	  •  Overestimate our contribution to a project
	  
	  •  Take credit, partial or complete, for successes that truly belong to others
	  
	  •  Have an elevated opinion of our professional skills and our standing among our peers
	  
	  •  Conveniently ignore the costly failures and time-consuming dead-ends we have created
	  
	  •  Exaggerate our projects’ impact on net profits because we discount the real and hidden costs built into them (the costs are someone else’s problems; the success is ours) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbrvwmtcrthhsj9x6kx8wtx))
	- Successful people consistently compare themselves favorably to their peers. If you ask successful professionals to rate themselves against their peers (as I have done with more than 50,000 people in my training programs), 80 to 85 percent of them will rate themselves in the top 20 percent of their peer group—and 70 percent will rate themselves in the top 10 percent. This number goes even higher among professionals with higher perceived social status, such as physicians, pilots, and investment bankers, 90 percent of whom place themselves in the top 10 percent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbs2yr1eytwfv4qdp5zbvwt))
	- Successful people believe that they have the capability within themselves to make desirable things happen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbs3kevy7bgh0b423gn6jn4))
	- We tend to believe that success is “earned” through an individual’s motivation and ability (even when it is not). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbs826ym3rs2e9e5394zhnm))
	- Successful people, however, believe there is always a link between what they have done and how far they have come—even when no link exists. It’s delusional, but it is also empowering ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbs8e3h20d7qzjh071n75xp))
	- One of the greatest mistakes of successful people is the assumption, “I am successful. I behave this way. Therefore, I must be successful *because* I behave this way!” The challenge is to make them see that sometimes they are successful *in spite of* this behavior. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbsafzdt4cpc5vd0dh3rc89))
	- Successful people have a unique distaste for feeling controlled or manipulated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbsf3f7n81hme17dyf6xe9c))
	- *cognitive dissonance*. It refers to the disconnect between what we believe in our minds and what we experience or see in reality. The underlying theory is simple. The more we are committed to believing that something is true, the less likely we are to believe that its opposite is true, even in the face of clear evidence that shows we are wrong. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbsg650dzz6rrdrwearmm7n))
	- Yet cognitive dissonance actually works in favor of successful people when they apply it to themselves. The more we are committed to believing that something is true, the less likely we are to believe that its opposite is true, even in the face of evidence that shows we may have chosen the wrong path. It’s the reason successful people don’t buckle and waver when times get tough. Their commitment to their goals and beliefs allows them to view reality through rose-tinted glasses. That’s a good thing in many situations. Their personal commitment encourages people to “stay the course” and to not give up when the going gets tough ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxbsgxye3t26xf7zx477x4kc))

	- What applies to disparate parts of a giant company also applies to disparate people in an organization. You can’t force people to work together. You can’t mandate synergy. You can’t manufacture harmony, whether it’s between two people or two divisions. You also can’t order people to change their thinking or behavior. The only law that applies is natural law ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcf5vmq4z4fajsfrfmjsdeh))
	- The only natural law I’ve witnessed in three decades of observing successful people’s efforts to become more successful is this: *People will do something*—*including changing their behavior*—*only if it can be demonstrated that doing so is in their own best interests as defined by their own values* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcf6bysevtzwqj7s14d4efr))
	- when you take self-volition out of the equation and forces beyond your control are involved, natural law applies. In order for me to get you to do what I want, I have to prove that doing so will benefit you in some way, immediately or somewhere down the road. This is natural law. Every choice, big or small, is a risk-reward decision where your bottom-line thinking is, “What’s in it for me?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcf7685cjgd7v9mvrxg77na))
	- Most people’s resistance to change can be overcome by invoking natural law. Everyone, even the biggest ego in the room, has a hot button that can be pushed—and that button is self-interest. All we have to do is find it. It’s not the same thing in all people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcfdfftk0x07e0zng4zcj3h))
	- successful people make it easy to find the button. If you press people to identify the motives behind their self-interest it usually boils down to four items: money, power, status, and popularity. These are the standard payoffs for success. It’s why we will claw and scratch for a raise (money), for a promotion (power), for a bigger title and office (status). It’s why so many of us have a burning need to be liked by everyone (popularity). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxcfe6vy6mvjfdhk3hhef1pg))
