	- Introduction
		- To create successful products you need to obsess about customer needs, pain points, and desires.
	- Chapter 1 - The What and Why of Continuous Discovery
	  collapsed:: true
		- Discovery is the process of deciding what to build. Discovery isn't a one time activity.
		- Delivery is the work that you do to build and ship a product as a delivery
		  collapsed:: true
			- Many companies place an emphasis on deliver—they focus on whether the product was delivered on time, on scope, and on budget—while under-investing in discovery. Most companies forget to assess if they are building the right stuff.
				- Many teams are still measured by what they deliver and not whether anyone used it or if they created any other value for the customer or the business.
		- Decision Making
		  collapsed:: true
			- "We started to push decision making from business stakeholders to product managers and eventually to the whole product team. We started to  question how we made discovery decisions.
				- This process change requires involvement of customers during the discovery processes and co-creating ideas with them. Rather than validating their ideas, they are co-creating with customers—combining the team's knowledge of what's technically possible with the customer's knowledge of their own needs, pain points, an desires to build better products.
		- Frameworks and Mindsets
		  collapsed:: true
			- Many teams chase frameworks, tools, and methodologies, hoping that each new innovation will suddenly unlock the door to product success. For these frameworks, tools, and methodologies to succeed a corresponding mindset needs to be applied.
				- Outcome-oriented
				  collapsed:: true
					- Rather than defining your success by the code that you ship (your output), you define success as the value that code creates for your customers and for the the business.
					- Rather than measuring values in features and bells and whistles, we measure success in impact—the impact we have had on our customer's live and the impact we have on the sustainability and growth for the business.
				- Customer-centric
					- The business is purpose is to create value and serve a customer. We elevate customer needs to be on par with our own business needs and focus on creating customer value and (our) business value.
					- Wells Fargo and the fraudulent openings of bank accounts unauthorized by their customers is one example of an even that could have been prevented if the business had a customer centric mindset on top of a outcomes oriented one. Solely an outcomes perspective will lead people to pursue goals through illegal means
				- Collaborative
				  collapsed:: true
					- Embrace the cross-functional nature of digital product work and reject the siloed model, where we had off deliverables through stage gates. Decisions should be made collaboratively with as much input from other teams.
				- Visual
					- Start to apply spatial thinking to supplement the spoken and written language. Start drawing to externalize your thinking and to map what you know.
				- Experimental
				- Continuous
		- A working definition of continuous discovery
			- **Product teams make decisions every day. Our goal with continuous discovery is to infuse those daily decisions with as much customer input as possible.**
	- Chapter 2 - A common framework for continuous discovery
	  collapsed:: true
		- Starting with outcomes, rather than outputs, is what lays the foundation for product success. Switch from obsessing about features (outputs) to focusing on the impacts those features have on both the customers and the business (outcomes.)
		- Meeting with clients is for conducting research in pursuit of a desired outcome that creates value for the customer.
		- Finding the best path to your desired outcome is what researchers call an ill-structured problem—also commonly called a "wicked problem." Ill-structured problems are defined by having many solutions. There are no right or wrong answers, only better or worse ones. #[[Books: Marketing Saves the World]]
			- Much of the work of solving an ill-structured problem is framing the problem itself.
			- Opportunities represents the customers needs, pain points, and desires collectively. They are opportunities for us to intervene in our customer's lives. We don't refer to them as problems because, not all problems that need solving are opportunities.
			  collapsed:: true
				- For example, ice cream is delicious and mountain biking is fun, however not necessarily needed as eating healthy vegetables and going to the gym may represent more of an ideal solution. In these examples, the opportunities are addressing desires not problems.
			- Good problem solvers try out many framings, exploring how each impacts the solutions space.
			- The two most important steps for reaching our desired outcomes are first, how we map and structure the opportunity and second, howe we select which opportunities to pursue. Often product teams skip these steps and immediately start with an outcome and simply generate ideas. The right problem framing will help ensure that we explore the problem space and ultimately ship better solutions.
		- Define the clear outcome you want in order to define the scope for discovery. From there you must discover and map out the opportunity space. This gives us the structure to the ill-structured problem of reaching our desired outcome. You can use an opportunity solution tree to help you visualize the problem.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1660622703317_0.png)
				- Opportunity solution trees are a simple way of visually representing the paths you might take to reach a desired outcome. The opportunity solution trees help you resolve the tension between business needs and customer needs by prioritizing your business needs like sustainability and cost efficiencies. Next explore the customer needs, pain points and desires that, if addressed, would drive the outcome. The key is finding the opportunities that would drive the busines needs.
				  collapsed:: true
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1660623806947_0.png)
				- The opportunity solution tree breaks down large, project-sized opportunities into smaller opportunities. This can help us focus on one small opportunity at a time that still creates value for the business and our customer.
		- **We often don't remember to the framing of the problem and fall in love with our first solution. We forget to ask, "How else might we solve this problem."**
		- There are four blockers for good decision making
			- 1. Looking too narrowly at a problem. This is why we want to try out as many frames as possible to frame the opportunity space.
			- 2. Looking for evidence that confirms our bias.
			- 3. Letting our short-term emotions affect our decisions
			- 4. Overconfidence. We are often sure our ideas will be wildly successful.
		- Don't frame problems as "Whether or got should we do this?" Instead use "Which of these customer needs is most important for us to address right now?" as this question will compare and contrast our options
		- Problem Space vs Solution Space
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1660658958108_0.png)
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1660658984726_0.png)
			- The solution space should evolve together with the problem space and not siloed by different roles and functions.
			- We should reflect on why ideas may fail to be a solution instead of quickly moving to testing the next idea. We want to ask "Based on my current understanding of my customer, I thought this solution would work. It didn't. What did I misunderstand about my customer?"
				- We then need to revise our understanding of the opportunity space before moving to new solutions. When we do, our next set of solutions become better.
				- We can combine this process with visualizing the opportunity with the OST so we have a visual understanding of the solutions. When a solution fails, they can revisit this mapping to quickly revise that understanding.
			- Work both from the top-down and bottom-up when working with the Opportunity Solution Tree.
				- Top down work means starting by clearly defining the desired outcome, then mapping out the opportunity space, then considering the solutions, and finally running assumption tests.
				- Bottom up work means using assumption tests to help evaluate the solutions and evolve the opportunity space. As the opportunity space is more understood the understanding of how to reach the outcome and how to best measure those outcomes will also evolve.
				- Good teams continue to conduct customer interviews from week to week to continue exploring the opportunity space even when after they've selected a target opportunity. They consider multiple solutions for their target opportunity, setting up good "compare and contrast" decisions. They run assumption tests across their solution set, in parallel, so that they don't overcommit to less-than-optimal solutions. They continue to visualize their work in the opportunity solution tree to help them assess what to do next.

		- Stakeholder Management
		  collapsed:: true
			- Balance sharing too much information and too little with your stakeholders. Don't send them all your notes without synthesis or full recordings of meetings without highlighting the important takeaways your team agreed to. On the other hand, be careful of only sharing cherry picked information to stakeholders. One extreme asks too much work from your stakeholders, the other too little.
			- We want to strike a balance of information sharing where the stakeholders are able to give us important feedback easily on the process and progress of our work.
			- When sharing work stakeholders use the opportunity solutions tree to remind them of the desired outcome of the project. Next, we can walk them through the opportunity space to clarify our understanding of the customers and stakeholders.
				- The tree structure can help us communicate the big picture while also diving into the details. The tree should visually show what solutions you are considering and what tests you are running to evaluate those solutions. Instead of communicating your conclusions (e.g., "We should build these solutions"), you are showing the thinking and learning that got you there. #[[Decision Tree]]
					- This process allows the stakeholders to evaluate your work and to weigh in with information you may not have.
	- Chapter 3 - Focusing on Outcomes over Outputs
		- When teams manage outcomes we give our teams the autonomy, responsibility, and ownership to chart their own path. Instead of asking the team to deliver a fixed roadmap full of features by a specific date in time, we are asking them to solve a customer problem or to address a business need. The distinction with this strategy is that we are giving the team the autonomy to find the best solution over delivering features.
			- A fixed roadmap communicates false certainty. It says we know these are the right features to build, even though we know from experience their impact will likely fall short.
