			- Digital Product Management is formed by two fundamental concept of the **iterative validation process** and the activities of the **Product-Market Fit**
				- ((63d34335-5a5f-4d2f-b6fc-eb35417c75c5))
				- **Validation cycle**
					- When creating a hypothesis, you are already thinking about what and how you are measuring, including the targets that indicate whether your hypothesis is correct.
					- The Build Measure Learn cycle forms the validation cycle. Where the hypothesis informs what we test by building an increment of a product then we measure the data to validate the hypothesis or importantly learn from the data to form another hypothesis.
				- **Product-Market Fit** is composed of:
					- Validation step - where we find out if our product solves a real problem for real customers?
					- Viable - does the product provide net value to our business that we should offer it?
					- Feasible - Can we build the product given the organization's constraints

	  collapsed:: true
		- What are the differences between product managers and product owners.
		  collapsed:: true
			- It is recommended that these two roles should be split among two people, but in some organizations one person can fulfill both roles.
			- The product manager is responsible for the "busines" aspect of the product—customer segmentation, forecasting, or competitive analysis.
			- Product owners are responsible for the development activities including release tracking, story acceptance, and backlog grooming.
			- These two roles can overlap in vision or product roadmap, release planning, or needs and feature definition.
			- ((63d34335-2715-46b1-b33e-2d46edf19016))
		- What is a key difference between product managers and project managers?
			- Project managers only care about the successful delivery of the project and not whether the project actually benefits or enables the success of the business.
		- What are 5 areas of ROI from the user experience designers?
			- Increase overall revenue or value creation for users because greater ease of use leads to better emotional attachment
			- Increased customer satisfaction because customers love well-designed products that fulfills their needs and eases their pain

	- The Practices of Digital Organizations
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674611241747_0.png) These drawings illustrate two of the foundational concepts in Digital Product Management: the iterative, continuous, interconnected nature of creating digital products, which is unlike linear processes of traditional business.

	- Build-Measure-Learn Cycle
		- On the left, we have the Validation or Build-Measure-Learn (BML) cycle. The continuous Validation cycle shows how we go about building digital products. We start with a hypothesis, which Webster’s defines as “a tentative assumption made in order to draw out and test its logical or empirical consequences.” And this is exactly what we do in the BML cycle. Our hypotheses are all about customer problems, solutions, and ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqk9snv8s8mzktcw8d51c5xw)) markets. When we create a well-formed hypothesis, we have decided in advance what and how we will measure, including targets that indicate whether our hypothesis is correct. We then build out our hypotheses into “products” we can test. Your product can be anything from a description of a customer problem we think we can solve, to a feature in a full-fledged product. We measure our built-out “products” by collecting data. Then we use this data to learn. Was our test a success? Did we confirm or refute our hypothesis? Should we build this or that, for one market or another? Can we move on to the next hypothesis or go back to the drawing board? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqk9t8vwv7v3tm6njs392ms9))
	- Product-Market Fit triad On the right, we have the Product-Market Fit triad. Each of these three interlocking circles describes a standard our products must meet to be successful in our chosen market. They are:
		- • Valuable: Does our product solve a real problem for real customers?
		- • Viable: Does this product provide net value to our business such that we should offer it? Should we do this?
		- • Feasible: Can we build this product given our company’s constraints – from staffing to compliance to existing technological advances? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqk9v3dknx9a2bgpme1n2bm8))

	- What is a Digital Product?
		- A digital product is any product delivered online that doesn’t have physical form or substance. You can’t hold a website theme in your hand, smell an e-book, or taste an application. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkcbkwja01revasaj3zdr6p))
		  id:: 63d0b6c0-900d-4612-adce-85afce3e2bbf
		- Note: Software installed on-premise - whether on PC or ‘servers’ - is not Digital in the context of this course unless it can be updated easily via the internet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkcc4f03kdd474hg0erk5r2))
		  id:: cff16e28-61d2-4642-838d-9cac3d84f756
	- It is our primary job as Digital Product Managers to strive for Product-Market Fit in everything our teams do – from major launches to minor features. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkbdczcdbgrs0vc0vpf9g41))
	  id:: 63d34335-bb90-45dd-978d-649114be6212
	- Finally, achieving Product-Market Fit is not a one-time event, nor is it immediate. It is also an iterative process, as illustrated by the center arrows. In fact, it is going through the Build- Measure-Learn Cycle that allows us to achieve Product-Market Fit over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkbe48mxmjevdcrayk2ewec))
	  id:: 63d34335-55f1-46cb-8dba-72d0692beb3f
	- One of the most notable innovations of SaaS is the iterative business model. Think of this as a flywheel. As **a business grows, new customers become happy customers** – and in turn provide referrals to yet more new customers. So goes the cycle of a successful SaaS business: A/R/M or simply ARM.
	  id:: 44e232b8-abbe-460c-b67d-60cc3d367a7f
		- This three-step ARM process is how digital business economics works – particularly in SaaS businesses. They earn revenue based on how well they do in each of these three areas. This doesn’t equate to profit but each part of the ARM sequence is necessary for these businesses to succeed and grow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkbhndyzzy17dedx8xmmwpc))

	- Important: Many SaaS metrics are based on this model, so this is the foundation for how digital businesses define and track success ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkbhrrmrraktg5av85n954y))
	- Product-Led Growth (PLG) refers to a model that uses your product and your users as the primary mechanism to drive growth. You acquire new customers, while retaining and monetizing your existing customers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkbsny4s1nwhaag9st9xe2m))
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674613387417_0.png)
		- While simple in concept, this is in stark contrast to the well-worn model of using Sales and Marketing teams and programs for these efforts. And, here, ‘Service’ means most, or all customer-facing transactions are handled inside the product: Implementation, Onboarding, Product Support, Upsell, and Renewals, among others. We can do this only with Digital Products because we are in continuous contact with our users! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkbt6964tqahk2rxfq9gj94))
	- The Digital Product Manager Role The role of the digital product manager is complex and multi-faceted. It centers around the six interlocking skills listed here:

		  3. Setting measurable goals 
		  4. Making data-informed decisions 
		  5. Facilitating the work of UX, engineering and cross-functional teams

	- The PM and PO roles are each substantial and it is generally a Best Practice to split these roles across two people into two separate jobs. But some organizations combine these roles into a single job. This can depend on the maturity of the Product, Product Manager and Company. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdb6r2w1m17pn956eazv1c))
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674614187472_0.png)
		  id:: 63d34335-2715-46b1-b33e-2d46edf19016
	- More mature products and PM practices, often at larger companies, separate and differentiate these two roles. If these are two separate roles at your company, it’s important that you be on the same team and staying in step so that you are aligned to the same strategic goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdbhmwj8djapg16fc8tqd5))
	- Other companies combine these into a single job. If you are acting as product owner, remember that this is a set of tasks you are responsible for, but Product Manager is your JOB and it is much broader than writing and prioritizing stories. Product Managers typically need to do a lot of future planning, opportunity assessment and prioritizing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdc18dhtewx9y0ftc2ehhd))
	- The big issue here is that all of these tasks need to get done. And you need to have clarity on who has responsibility for each of these items. When you map the two roles into one, you can see that the Product Owner is responsible for the detailed execution and delivery work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdcgyh0mepn2ay96j8mx53))
	- Product Manager, NOT Project Manager!
		- It is a common confusion – that ProDUCT management is the same as ProJECT management. This is a misconception – and is often received without humor by Product Managers. We are often held responsible for the output of the engineering teams we work with. Did it come out on schedule? Did we meet our cost projections? Was quality high enough? We are not a project manager or even a Scrum Master, which is a specific project management role dictated by Scrum. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkddnq27h9rbbde2bpsag3w))
	- Our work as Digital Product Managers is about enabling the success of the business. If our projects are on time, on budget and have few defects – but no-one uses them, buys them, or they fail to hit any of our business targets – we have ALL failed! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkde41zzmh1qd5wp96c4kk1))
	- Growth Product Managers You may have heard the term “growth product manager,” you may have one or more of these in your organization, or this may be your title. Growth product managers are PMs who have specific types of goals and employ specific practices to achieve these goals. GPMs are often focused on improving specific business metrics, e.g., “Increase new purchases by 5% this quarter”. They generally rely on doing continuous product experiments to help achieve their goal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdfm83cp7jhqfdr9jazkc9))
	- Your most direct measurements could have to do with usage of the specific feature your team is developing, while the GPM is working to increase the number of users clicking the “buy now” button. The important thing to remember is that it’s a matter of focus. All businesses are working to improve business metrics. Some hire growth product managers to focus on this specifically. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdg2tmva9fh591rfc4wkgm))
	- Product Operations (ProdOps) Teams
		- While product managers often have a wide skill set, managing (and aligning) all the different tools and practices that make up the modern product stack isn’t always the best use of those skills. As product teams grow, the need for alignment becomes bigger and bigger, and this is where Product Operations [ProdOps] comes in.
		- The Product Operations role may incorporate:
			- Coordinating communication to and from PM across the company.
			- Ensuring DPMs are collecting reliable data, have the reports they need, and are designing good experiments. In this way, they can overlap with the role of a data team or in some cases be established instead – to specifically serve the product team.
			- Establishment and maintenance of product tools and processes. Roles on the ProdOps team can include but not limited to: Pricing, Release Management, Data analyst, technical writing, project management, and others. In a growing product organization, a ProdOps team can lay the foundation for a successful, data-driven team of product managers.

	- 5 key areas for ROI from UX ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdj3f0p0xrz57kr9prj836))
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1674618395301_0.png)
	- 1. Boosting overall revenue/conversion – because of greater ease of use leads to better emotional attachment to the brand and resulting customer loyalty.
	- 2. Increased customer satisfaction – because customers love well-designed products that give them what they need and want (and what they don’t know they need and want).
	- 3. Lower support costs – because pre-empting so many likely user problems via UX techniques lowers the company’s costs.
	- 4. Reduced development waste – which increases development efficiency and thus saves money in the development phase.
	- 5. Reduced risk of building the wrong thing – User research is a tool to find out what your customers will find to be the most usable and valuable things. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkdj7ffjg0smz46wswb0az8))

	- Like the PM / PO boundary, there can be considerable overlap between the PM and UX roles. At the best digital companies, these roles collaborate with each other daily. They join forces to ensure that what they are creating is valuable and usable for customers. The difference between them is often at the detailed level. Product Managers are not typically responsible for UI design, while UX researchers and designers don’t dive deeply into the business viability of their products.

	- Four Data Team Archetypes The data teams at your company typically break into four types of roles. It’s very helpful for you to know the difference so that you can figure out who to work with for what purpose. Some people have more than one of these characteristics and well-staffed data science teams have all four. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmamjfbzmvp6t451cbkhqf))
	- 1. Data Detectives understand how to get the data to help stakeholders answer their questions and develop strategy. • Examples – market researchers, User Experience Research • They use tools like Qualtrics or Survey Monkey, or academic research sources. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmatgjmr5edb5t69drmnkn))
	- 2. Data Guardians build databases and understand their data dictionaries, perhaps managing a data warehouse. • Examples – Database Administrators (DBAs). Database administration is an operational or technical function responsible for physical database design, security enforcement, and database performance. Tasks include maintaining the data dictionary, monitoring performance, and enforcing organizational standards and security. • Their tooling is often based on SQL, a common language for managing data held in a relational database. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmaym3vga38r87qbtk4p14))
	- 3. Data Wranglers are typically programmers who build automation to pull data from APIs
	  and databases. They may also build and run advanced analytical models.
	  • Example – Data Engineers and Statisticians
	  • Data Wranglers work in code – nowadays this is frequently Python. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmbbcasstf2x3dzf6gzf9z))
	- 4. Data Storytellers know how to translate complex data into digestible information. As the
	  name suggests, they know how to use data to tell a story,
	  • Example –Marketing Manager
	  • They use tools such as Tableau or presentation tools like PowerPoint. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmbfpwymazwz79cqk2n9mr))
	- As a digital product manager, data detective and data storyteller skills are very valuable. It
	  matters less if you can write SQL queries if you know how to ask great questions and what
	  data is likely to answer these. And using data to illustrate stories is essential for PMs to
	  communicate effectively and enroll fellow employees, teammates and management. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmbwzrjs35vd886cqq9nf3))
	- Product Management, UX and Engineering work together
	  symbiotically in the digital organization. Much of this collaboration is driven by the structure
	  of the Agile teams. But it’s critical that these three roles collaborate in Discovery, beyond the
	  standard Agile rituals. This is because they are collectively responsible for defining and
	  validating Product-Market Fit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkmdkxpdxnjr5mj7b6v0egj))
	- Each role has a collaborative and overlapping mission, with Product Management
	  ultimately responsible for the entire value proposition.
	  PM and UX work closely together on the user research and human-centered design
	  processes to understand the user problems and prototype solutions.
	  UX and Engineering work together to define how to solve problems for users and
	  determine which solutions are feasible to produce. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqkme1wxvsmzdf4pwgv42t4k))
