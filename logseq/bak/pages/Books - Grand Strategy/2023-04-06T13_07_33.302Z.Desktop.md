	- Chapter 1 - Crossing the Hellespont
	  collapsed:: true
		- [[Philip Tetlock]]'s book researched the types of people who were good at predicting and forecasting the future. The differentiator was found in the style of thinking by people. The better forecasters were people who were self-proclaimed foxes - people who knew a lot of different things rather than people who knew a lot of one thing.

			- In contrast the poor forecasters brushed aside criticism, aggressively deploying big explanations they displayed a bristly impatience with those who do not get it.
			- He proposed that self-critical thinkers are better at figuring out the contradictory dynamics of involving situations, more circumspect about their forecasting prowess, more accurate in recalling mistakes, less prone to rationalize those mistake, more likely to update their beliefs in a timely manner.
		- Another approach to decision making it to hold both a self-deprecating and self-critical style of thinking with one of ambition and deep knowledge  as a foundation for confident thought. We need to keep in mind the long-term aspirations in balance with immediate necessities.

			- Whatever balance we strike we need to consider our current location and our intended destination.
		- Our choices now, can have significant or insignificant effects in the future. Our choice to eat cereal instead of a hot bagel is inconsequential in the long term. In contrast what we study during our college years and what job we take has great impact for years to come.
		  id:: 62aa1979-9f9a-477b-baae-64ebe9fb759b
			- Similarly, the actions we take now we have to strategically act for the consequences of the now but also the future consequences.

	- Chapter 2 - The Long Walls
	  collapsed:: true
		- To nurture strategic thinking we need to foster and nurture a healthy relationship of learning both the general and the particular—between the universal and local knowledge. #[[strategic thinking]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- However history alone and reading is sufficient for strategic thinking, we also need to train and practice. Training is being able to draw upon principles extending across time and space, so that you'll have a sense of what's worked before and what hasn't.
			  collapsed:: true
				- We then apply this knowledge to the situation at hand as a result of scale and a plan is the result. The result is born and informed from the past, linked to the present, for achieving some future goal.
				- The engagement of the plan of course won't in many ways remain faithful to the plan as the execution is influenced by external factors—the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns.
				- The solution is to improvise, based on history and from those who have gone before.
			- Practice and the concept of training is the best protection we have against stupid strategies as they become grander,
			- We can look at the past to gain some sense of the future. In studying the past we must not frame it as moments frozen in time and space because we are born from the progressions of it across time and space that constantly shift from small to big scales and back again.
		- We can have have stupider decisions as we garner more authority and power. With an increase in title and position, so does self-consciousness, with more people watching, practice becomes more performance. Our reputation starts to matter and we become prisoners of our preeminence: we can lock in ourselves to roles that we can't escape from. We become rigid and inflexible.
		  collapsed:: true
			- Flexibility and goals are important balance, we need flexibility so we don't waste effort and resources in failed attempts to control the incontrollable and end up losing our direction. We need to know when to to go with the flow or fight the currents.
			- > Why, then, did the Americans invest so much in Vietnam when, in comparison with the whole of their interests at the time, so little was at stake there? Thucydidean resemblances, I think, suggest an answer. Megara might look like a trifle, Pericles told the Athenians in 432 B.C.E., but if they yielded on that small matter “you will instantly have to meet some greater demand.” “Without the United States,” John F. Kennedy warned a Texas audience on the morning of November 22, 1963, “South Viet-Nam would collapse overnight,” and American alliances everywhere were equally vulnerable. There was no choice, Pericles insisted, but to “resist our enemies in any way and in every way.” For, as Kennedy added: “We are still the keystone in the arch of freedom.”
				- However distant they may be in time and space, statements like these perch precariously across scale. For if credibility is always in doubt, then capabilities must become infinite or bluffs must become routine. Neither approach is sustainable: that’s why walls exist in the first place. They buffer what’s important from what’s not. When one’s own imprecisions pull walls down—as Pericles and Kennedy did when they dismissed the possibility of giving anything up—then fears become images, images become projections, and projections as they expand blur into indistinctiveness.
	- Chapter 3 - Teachers and Tethers
	  collapsed:: true
		- Master Sun advises, generals should act expediently in accordance with what is advantageous. Wise leaders should seek out opportunities that puts them in positions of strength and the problem at its weakest. They'll sail with the winds, not against them. They'll skirt swamps, not slog through them. They'll avoid battles until they're sure they can win them.
		- When making decisions consider how costly the affects of the decision is and the actions taken, not only in the present but the costs for the future as well.
			- > "War is a matter of vital importance to the State", Sun Tzu warns, not to be embarked upon "without due reflection."
		- Success comes as quickly as the least expenditure of resources and lives allows. "Know the enemy, know yourself. The Art of War exhorts. "Know the ground, know the weather. Your victory will then be total."
		- Find the simplicities in the complexities.
		- ^^You need a strong inclination for self-assessment to be a good leader.^^
		  collapsed:: true
			- In a position of strength we can worry about our weaknesses.
			- When acting on a problem, issue, or challenge have a purpose and act accordingly. Don't simply react. Think how one decision can be made what happens next.
				- Victories must connect: otherwise they won't go lead anywhere.
					- They if we don't create opportunities for them to take shape they can come from the unforeseen and we must take advantage but first we need to be able to recognize and discern their existence. Therefore we need to [[maneuver]] and this requires planning.
			- Be careful not to confuse aspirations with strategy.
			- Direct approaches work only when our capabilities that we have or have access to approximate aspirations.
			  collapsed:: true
				- Insufficiencies demands indirection and that requires [[maneuver]]:
					- > [W]hen capable, feign incapacity; when active, inactivity. When near, make it appear that you are far; when far away, that you are near. Offer an enemy a bait to lure him; feign disorder and strike him. . . . When he concentrates, prepare against him; where he is strong, avoid him. . . . Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance. . . . Keep him under a strain and wear him down.
						- Opposites held in mind simultaneously are the strategist's keys to victory.
					-
		- Know the past so you can be informed in the present to shape the future.
			- > Why, then, did the princeps see such value in planting—and preserving—this very long poem? “[T]he greatness of poetic perception,” the novelist Hermann Broch has him say to the dying poet, “and therefore your greatness, Virgil, lies in being able to grasp all of life . . . in a single survey, in a single work, in a single glance.” So are strategy and statecraft the ability to grasp interconnections? To know where you’ve been in order to see where you’re going? It’s hard to understand, otherwise, how an indirect approach—whether Odysseus’ twists and turns or Octavian’s probes and shifts—can ever reach Ithaca, or anywhere else. “[I]t will yet be part of my future fame,” Broch’s Augustus correctly concludes, “that I was the friend of Virgil.”
	- Chapter 4 - Souls and States
	  collapsed:: true
		- The genius of Augustine is that he concerns himself more with tensions than with their sources: order versus justice, war versus peace, Caesar versus God. For every "thou shalt not kill," Augustine finds commendations, within sacred texts of opposite behavior. He questions authorial intent. He's comfortable, up to a point, with contradictions. This makes his teachings procedural and not absolute.
		- Checklists adapt better to change the commandments. Checklists pose common questions in situations that may surprise: the idea is to reduce the likelihood of these surprises from happening.
		- What may make sense in one situation may not make sense in another.
		- If you have to use force don't destroy what you're trying to preserve.
		- Don't sweat it. Move on. Learn to live with contradictions
	- Chapter 5 - Princes as Pivots
	  collapsed:: true
		- About problem style of King Philip of 1958. Philip rushes from crisis to crisis, rarely resting, never fully in control. He’s whacking moles, and they pop up everywhere. Elizabeth, in contrast, refuses to hurry. She’ll whack when she has to—the raised hand can indeed remove a head—but she sets times and places. She resists unnecessary expenditures of resources, energy, reputation, and—unusually in a monarch—virginity. For like Penelope in The Odyssey, she’s beset by suitors. Unlike Penelope, however, Elizabeth weaves strategies, not shrouds.
			- The king, an Augustinian, sees his empire as a shroud connecting the City of Man to the City of God, no part of which is dispensable. “[R]ather than prejudice the Faith or God’s service in the slightest way,” he pledges at one point, “I will lose all my dominions and a hundred lives if I had them.”6 The queen, more Machiavellian, regards her state (not yet an empire) as a stage for performance rather than as a holy relic.7 “[B]e ye ensured,” she tells Londoners at her coronation, “that I will be as good unto you as ever queen was . . . [and] that for the safety and quietness of you all, I will not spare, if need be, to spend my blood.”8 Philip promises obedience to God, not his subjects. Elizabeth serves her subjects, fitting God to their interests. The king, looking to Heaven, venerates. The queen, feet on earth, calculates. The differences test the ideas of Augustine and Machiavelli against the demands of statecraft at the dawn of the modern age.
			- Queen Elizabeth had less lands to rule but favored delegation in contrast to Philip who had many lands including the Philippines.
			- Philip failed to see incompatibilities and this led him to pursue objectives at the expense of others. He failed to prioritize ends according to the corresponding resources he had. [[contradictions]]
				- Philip continued his invasion of England even though his navy lost 15,000 men and 50 ships. He believe God was testing him and that God would eventually provide Philip with success.
				- Philip would often resort to spiritual blackmail when his advisors warned him that his ambitions and objectives were larger than his capabilities. The King would claim that they lacked faith.
			- In contrast, Queen Elizabeth relished opposites and was not paralyzed by her concepts of God and religion. She sought to rule England through her own wisdom. She insisted on keeping ends within means. She never felt not up to her role. He worried repeatedly that he was not up to his. [[contradictions]]
				- Elizabeth didn't rush. She was patient. For the Queen, certainty doesn't require haste.
	- Chapter 6 - New Worlds
	  collapsed:: true
		- Queen Elizabeth took a patient approach for England's new world explorations compared King Philip of Spain's approach to exploration of the Americas. While Philip micromanaged, Elizabeth was content to let others do the exploration with joint ventures with external companies. In turn, she never risked her navy or her own money.
			- Spain's approach to ruling was imposing uniformities on particularities. This could produce impressive results, at the cost of shallow roots.
			- The English resisted uniformity and respected the current topography and differences of the land. Elizabeth tolerated (within limits) different religions and letting language grow. England's political and administrative institution in the British America were more likely to evolve from below than to be imposed from the above. It was a hodgepodge, but completely adaptive system.
				- An institutionalized approach for uniformity can result in a rigid and inflexible system. We risk suppressing creativity, innovation, and experimentation.
		- [[John Locke]]'s opposed supremacies: the people must obey the [[government]], but the government must reflect the people.
		- Jefferson embraced and was capable of living in a world of contradictions without trying to unify his environment. He proclaimed that all men were created equal yet he owned slaves.
		- Queen Elizabeth favored setting precedents rather than being bound by them (through their breaking?)
	- Chapter 7 - The Grandest Strategy #[[Decision Making]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Common sense is indeed like oxygen: the higher you go, the thinner it gets. As each triumph topped its antecedent, Napoleon’s grammar became his logic. Like Caesar, he rose so far above fundamentals as to lose sight of them altogether. Such ascents can be awe-inspiring: so too, in their day, were hot air balloons. But gravity is always present.
		- Rules, policies, and templates can tempt people to turn off their brains because they treat these administrative tools as a security blanket to solve their problems instead of creatively thinking each problem through. A balance needs to be struck between creative problem solving and applying routine policies and templates to low-risk projects.
		- You can't anything without first grasping its purest form.
		- Strategies exist to document, reflect, and define on the asymmetries of our aspirations and the capabilities we have as resources.
			- (i.e., Napolean chased the Russian army across Europe, leading to his armies own demise. The retreat of the Russians created friction for the systems of the French military system)
			- Napolean who show great determination as a junior officer lose their genius as they rise in rank. The title and position of leadership and the consciousness of these "needs" creates an environment for faulty decision making. So they stare straight ahead, listening to no one, fearing distractions, clinging to command even as it leads them into disaster.
		- **The mind that is most likely to display military genius is the inquiring mind rather than the creative mind, the comprehensive rather than the specialized approach, the calm rather than the excitable.** #[[q: How to be a leader without authority]]
		- Clausewitz see theory as training. Theory helps us strengthens our thinking and judgment and aids us for real life experiences. It is the lubricant that reduces friction and creates a calm mind when in practice.
			- Trouble comes not from embracing theory as a beginner, but from clutching it too closely when in practice. We are tempted to use theory to defy common sense and an excuse to justify our incompetence and explain away our faults. We become blind to what "common sense" and "critical minds" are plainly and clearly seen.
			- Clausewitz recounts Pfuel, an instructor of the Prussian War School, "was one of those theorists who so love their theory that they forget the purpose of the theory—its application in practice; in his love for theory, he hated everything practical and did not want to know about. [[We need to balance the practical and theoretical when adopting and executing frameworks.]]
			- Clausewitz values theory as an antidote to anecdotes: as a compression of the past transmitting experience, while making minimal claims about the future.
				- He sees theory as a tool for practice, not for predicting or forecasting the future. It is like a sketch, it provides enough information to guide but not to be used as a directive or prescribed. To do so, assumes the sketch has all the information, when it clearly does not.
				- Theories reduces history's complexity to teachable moments, it should not be used, like Tolstoy's plasterers, who smooth over irregularities in search of predictability.
		- Comprehension requires a sensitive and discriminating judgement..., a skilled intelligence for uncovering and then discerning the truth. This won't come from theories built only on what theorists, through their blinders, think they can measure.
			- (i.e., workmen who are plastering a building, take advantage of a foremen's absence, to plaster everything including windows and trims, and exclaim everything is flat and smooth)
			- Good comprehension and judgement seeks out irregularities at the edge of chaos which is, or appears to be, the realm of chance.
			- > (a) that because everything connects with everything else, there’s an inescapable interdependency across time, space, and scale—forget about distinguishing independent from dependent variables; (b) that, as a consequence, there’ll always be things that can’t be known—breaking them into components won’t help because there’ll always be smaller components; (c) that owing to what we can’t know, we’ll always retain an illusion of agency, however infinitesimal; (d) that while laws may govern these infinitesimals, they make no difference to us because we can’t feel their effects; therefore (e) our perception of freedom is, in practice, freedom itself.
			- We need to balance the knowns, probabilities, and the unknowns across time, space, and scale.
		- Each problem we encounter, especially the complex and challenging, requires respect through a balancing act between judgement and skills, learned from experience from the past and training for the future.

	- Chapter 8 - The Greatest President
	  collapsed:: true
		- In the early 1800s the Constitution protected [[slavery]]. John Adams in 1841 spoke in behalf of the Amistad captives—Africans sold for slavery in Spanish Cuba who'd freed themselves at sea, been seized by the American navy, and through sympathetic lawyers appealed for their forced return—Adams reminded the Supreme Court justices that framed copies of the Declaration of Independence flanked them on adjoining walls.
		- Some claim Lincoln was too slow and half-hearted in ending slavery. But if we presume he was a smart man, can we say that slow and steady is a strategy. He may have been obfuscating his true intentions with his seeming ambivalence, but he achieved his goal in the end. For those that doubt his intention from the start, have they ready the history books and can we really know how a person thinks inside.
			- Lincoln didn't force the issue until the circumstances allowed him to, using slaves in the army and calling them free.
			- Lincoln managed polarities, polarities didn't manage him. Scale sets the ranges, within experience accrues. A gradual expansion of edges better equips leaders for the unexpected than those that shock, leaving little time to adapt, or those inherited, which breed entitlement and arrogance.
				- An example of the benefits of slow expansion is the comparison between John Quincy Adams and Lincoln. Adams had great expectations, overestimation by others—which he magnified—placed objectives beyond his reach. No expectations lured Lincoln apart from those he set for himself: he started small, rose slowly, and only when ready reached for the top. His ambitions grew as his opportunities expanded, but he kept both within his circumstances.
