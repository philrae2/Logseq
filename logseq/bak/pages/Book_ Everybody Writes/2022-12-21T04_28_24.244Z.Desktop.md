				 - Place your reader up front of the story - have the reader be able to place themselves and relate to what you're writing 

			 - Produce the First Ugly Draft
				 - Don't worry about grammar, spelling, or complete sentences and readability.

			 - Walk Away
				 - Place distance between the first draft and the econd edit. 

			 - Rewrite
				 - Shape the initial draft to something your audience would want to read. 

				 - Take the perspective of your audience. 

			 - Have someone edit

			 - Have one final look for readability

			 - Publish your writing but not without answering one more reader question: what now?

	 - Spend a lot of time about what you want to communicate
		 - Figure out what you want to say before thinking about how you will write it about it

		 - Know the purpose or mission or objective of every piece of content

		 - Thinking about what you're going to write helps you find the key point
			 - The key point should be contained in one sentence.

			 - Why am I creating this? 
				 - What is my objective?

			 - What is the key take on the subject or issues? 
				 - What's my point of view.

			 - So what? Because?

	 - Organize your writing
