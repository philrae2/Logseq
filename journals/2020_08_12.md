- The higher you set your [[goals]], the more you will [[learn]], and the more you will achieve.

- [[Decision Making]]

- Complacency is the enemy of [[success]].

- [[Anxiety]] is a serous drawback [[charisma]].

- Blame Is Stupid. Don’t look for bad people; look for bad [[systems]]—ones that incentivize bad behavior and reward poor performance

- People whose identity is solidly rooted in [[God]]’s love moment-by-moment still try to do their best. But they do so because only this expresses their unsurpassable worth and significance. Moreover, they are now doing all that they do for the Lord who of course deserves our best.

- Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers. [[Negotiation]]

- [[Distractions]] impede us from making progress toward the life we envision.
