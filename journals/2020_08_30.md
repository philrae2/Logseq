	- Notes:
		- [[industrialism]] demands that people fit in its system
			- We are the workers, we are the customers, we are part of the bureaucracy
			- Prefers that everyone be the same, prefers that there be an average person
				- However there is no average person
		- [[Z: People want to be individuals, respected, to be understood, to feel special and we crave to be seen]] #marketing #manipulation
		- However we also want others (we serve, teach, support) to conform to the system
		- Build a system that accommodates to the customer, rather than the customer conform to the systems
		- Not all systems conform to the customers, schools want students to be the same or average #standardization #Education
			- Schools want students to be average, standardized tests, standardized lesson plans
			- Standardization allows the workers to not own the responsibility  of the outcome
		- Humans are not [[average]] so we have to put effort to meet and accommodate people who do not "fit" the system
		- Mass [[customization]] allows us to treat people differently for them to feel understood and to be seen #differentiation
			- The [[competitive advantage]] today is to see people as different and special to provide customized service for them that acknowledges that they are special
		- The best way to seek status is to help others and seek high status roles that are indirect #[[status roles]] #Leadership #influence
			- People who are self-less leaders, those who can weave a community around them, and able to take a longer term view are much more happier and [successful]([[success]])
