	 - We become great leaders by challenging ourselves and not complacent with "good" results. Great leaders strive for constant improvement and learning. In that struggle for improvement and knowledge, they don't run away from difficulties and challenges.
		 - Often we grow unmotivated to keep fighting for our goals when we have roadblocks keeping us away from achieving them. We blame other people, existing policies, and whatever else surrounding us, instead of taking the responsibility and accountability to act.

		 - Great leaders don't give up. They innovate. They become smarter and clever. They work harder and more passionate about their goals.

	 - When we create leadership principles we are improving our decision-making process not only individually but especially helpful with more people or large organizations. In group decision-making or in large organizations we have to make sure that the decision frameworks are in alignment with the goals of the organization. 
		 - Without leadership principles, decision-making choices will fall on the more authoritative, eloquent, dominant, experienced, and defender of the status quo or established practices. And not necessarily the informed person especially if they lack these influential qualities.

		 - Leadership principles allows everyone to make decisions based on the organization's guiding principles and creates tools to help informed people who are not holding power, authority, or influence to shape the organization.

		 - Without guiding leadership principles authority, influence and power can silence the voices of those who are informed and knowledgeable.
			 - This silencing affect can slow down innovation and transformation.

		 - Leadership principles keep us humble in our knowledge. This humility helps us to make sure that we validate and confirm our [[decision making]] instead of relying on assumptions.

	 - We can create intentional feedback loops in our process designs that ask for feedback from users to create improvements in the system. 

	 - We create [[leadership principles]] to give tools to people in organizations that are less influential the ability to speak up during decision making and mitigate poor decision-making factors like influence and authority.
