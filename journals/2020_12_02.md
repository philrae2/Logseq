- [[Evening Prayer]]
	 - Thank  you Lord for today's good feedback from Christine on my one-one meeting with her. Thank you for the blessings and the intelligence you have given me to be successful at work. Lord I pray for your continued guidance, empowerment, and blessings not only at work but my personal life too.

	 - Lord I ask to be humble, to give you all the glory and all the praise. I am not spending as much time with you, help me to keep you in my thoughts. Lord help me to spend more time with you. 

	 - Lord I want to ask for guidance on the Orange Book project. I feel like it is out of my control. Father God help me to lead that well and to accept the outcomes of what ever your plans are. Help me to have faith in your knowledge and guidance. In your name I pray. Amen.
