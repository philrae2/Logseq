- [[Meetings]]
	 - [[Orange Book Project]] + [[Mahmoud Abuelroos]]
		 - Purpose: Thoughts from Mahmoud on how to address Tim's concerns on the level of support they need from OBI. Tim brought up that they are not used to waiting 3-4 months for a resolution

		 - Complications: 
			 - I didn't put enough pressure on the item to test 
				 - Project ran out of time, Integrity was obligated with other projects so they couldn't support as much as I needed to

				 - Tim stated there is hesitation to move forward with Phase 2 if support is expected to be like this. Phase 1 was the easiest workflow and phase 2 would be more complicated

			 - The team isn't prioritizing this as high as it should be, calling it an enhancement but from a client perspective it's a defect

		 - Support needed:
			 - Can PMO provide better support to help projects when there is disagreement on priority of a request (defect vs enhancement)

			 - Listen to Orange Book Product Owners and provide a better answer than accepting the status quo. 

			 - Provide PMO as another channel for Product Owners to go to if they don't feel like they are being heard by Implementation
