			- Summary slide
				- The Orange Book Nexus project is a multiyear and multiphase process. We are in phase 1 of a total of 3 phases.
					- In phase 1 we are transitioning the review of new NDA patents into Nexus.
					- The overall goal of the 3 phases is to simplify and unify the different workflows of the Orange Book staff into one system, with the OBMOD system acting as the systems of record for patent and patent related information.
					- And Nexus will provide a more robust workflow solution.
				- The benefits of the Nexus Orange Book
					- Nexus provides automation through automatic parsing of the 3542 forms and creating a robust workflow solution that provides reporting, monitoring, and tracking of review activities.
			- Current NDA Workflow

			- Demo Objectives
				- Home page
					- The home page has 3 tabs:
						- Home, Search, and Reports
							- Search allows for searching of work items by different filters
							- Reports tab has 3 tabs
								- One allows for reporting of deficiency letters
								- Aged patent reports allows to search for patent submissions that are not completed yet
								- Outbound documents allows to search for documents sent to the document room and if recent enough, stop and intercept before sending out to the sponsor
							- Home page has 3 different queues and 3 tabs
								- 3 tabs are pat
					- Pending Patent queue

	- [[Daily Call]] + [[Orange Book Project]]
		- When do Orange Book Staff receive notifications of incoming 3542  submissions.
		- TODO   use code number search - add to backlog item post launch
		- Tim said that DARRTS queue will be compared to Nexus
			- TODO  how will we qc incoming submissions compared to DARRTS
- #[[Lessons Learned]]
	- Ask direct questions instead up of upstream questions. Example ask what the qc will be between DARRST and Orange Book submission instead of asking of the notification upstream process.

		- **Classic organizational structures**
			- The **Classic organizational structure** is a top-down hierarchy system, where a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has direct authority over several department managers. The department manager has direct authority over several other sections of employees. This system requires communication both up and down the ladder. In a Classic structure, authority comes from the top and filters to the bottom. Frequent reporting of project status updates may be required to pass up through management levels to keep higher leaders informed.
			- Classic organizations are also referred to as **functional organizations** because the organization is divided into departments based on function. Each department is led by a **functional manager**, and employees are grouped according to the functions of their role. For example, the main function of Friendly Skies Airlines, an airline company, is to fly airplanes. There are typically departments logically arranged to fulfill other important company functions, such as Marketing, Human Resources, and Strategy. Employees usually have a specialty within the organization and may not work within other areas during normal everyday operations.
		- **Matrix organizational structures**
			- The **Matrix** structure differs from the Classic structure in that the employees have two or more managers. In Matrix structures, you still have people above you, but you also have people in adjacent departments with whom you will need to communicate on your work progress. Functional areas tend to cross paths more frequently, and depending on the nature of the work, the responsible manager for each area has the most authority.
			- As a project manager in a Matrix organization, your team will essentially have at least two chains of command, or managers. You can think of the project manager as being a temporary manager while the employee is assigned to the team, whereas the functional manager is consistent regardless of which project the employee is supporting. The visual below illustrates what the Friendly Skies Airlines would look like if it had a Matrix organizational structure.

	- PMO - Project Management Office #[[Lessons Learned]]
		- The PMO should be ensuring that all different parts that are associated with projects are connected together. Each component should know what the others are doing.
		- A huge benefit of working in a PMO is that you get to connect with other project managers, where you can share your challenges and see how somebody else had gotten through it. Or you can share templates or tools that you may take time to develop on your own, but somebody else already has handy, so you can borrow or just steal their tool for your own use. But the best part is you have a community of people who think the same way about problems in a very methodical, in a very task-oriented, in a very action-oriented and goal-oriented way, which is not typically true if you're working across all other disciplines all the time.
	- Understanding the Organization
		- Understanding an organization's culture will help you navigate your team more effectively toward achieving the project's goal. It also impacts the way you plan your project. You'll need to be familiar with an organization's culture so that you can minimize conflict and complete the project with as much support and harmony as possible. An organization's mission and values can provide clues to its culture. If you can demonstrate how the project supports the company's mission or how the project aligns with the company's values, you'll have more support from executives and stakeholders to get the approvals and resources you need. Pay attention to what leaders in the organization value when conducting business. Does the management team care about speed over perfection? How do people within the organization make decisions? Do they thoroughly examine every option for every decision? This will help inform which values are the most important to them and how you can approach your decision-making. #culture
		- As a project manager, when you understand the different types of values, and what to prioritize, you'll have an idea of how you can better prepare for conversations within the organization. Ideally, you'll want to have a good sense of an organization's culture before you start the first phase of your project.
		- To help you gain a better sense of an organization's culture, consider the following questions. How do people prefer to communicate? Is it primarily through scheduled meetings, via email, over the phone? How are decisions made, majority vote or top down approvals? What kinds of rituals are in place when someone new comes to the office? Are they taken out to lunch, given a tour of the building or introduced to the staff? How are projects typically run? Do they prefer a Classic, do they prefer Matrix, or some other style of project management? And finally, what kinds of practices, behaviors, and values are reflected by the people in the organization? Is overtime or weekend work an expectation? Are there company sanctioned social events? Finding out what the company values, will tell you a lot about the culture. And how to handle communication, manage expectations, and identify potential conflicts as you work through your project.
		- **The importance of organizational culture **
			- **Identity: **An organization’s culture defines its identity. Its identity essentially describes the way the company conducts  business, both internally and externally. A company’s values and organizational culture go hand-in-hand; its values are part of its identity. You can almost think of an organization’s culture as its personality. That is why it is important to learn your company’s (or target company’s) mission and value statements. The mission and value statements will help you understand why the company exists and will give you insight into what the company believes in and how it will behave.
			- **People: **Strong, positive organizational culture helps retain a company’s best employees. People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to give their best and want to drive for success. An organization’s culture can help keep talented employees at a company, and it can attract great people too! On the other hand, a toxic culture can have the opposite effect. It is important to find an organization with a culture that fits your personality. One way to find out more about an organization's culture is to talk to the people who work there. You can also take note of the current employees’ attire, expressions, and overall behavior.
			- **Processes: **Organizational culture can have direct impacts on a company's processes, and ultimately, its productivity. The organization’s culture is instilled throughout the company—from its employees to how its employees do their job. For example, a company that values feedback and employee involvement might have that reflected in their processes by including many opportunities for employees to comment. By allowing employees to feel their voices are heard, this company is adhering to its culture.
		- **Understanding an organization’s culture**
			- As a project manager, it is important to understand your company’s culture, especially because it could affect the projects you work on. Some aspects of an organization’s culture that are directly related to how you will manage projects are communication, decision-making, rituals, previous management styles, and values. To learn more about a company’s culture and how it applies to you as a project manager, you can:
		- **Ask questions**
			- You can learn about an organization's culture by asking questions of management and peers. It can be helpful to ask these questions in the interview phase to better understand the company’s culture before accepting a position. You might want to ask questions about:
		- **Atmosphere**
			- What is the company’s dress code?
			- How do people typically share credit at this company?
			- Is risk-taking encouraged, and what happens when people fail?
			- How do managers support and motivate their team?
			- How do people in this role interact with customers and users?
			- When and how do team members give feedback to one another?
			- What are some workplace traditions?
			- What are some of the ways the company celebrates success?
		- **Policies**
			- What are the policies around sick days and vacation?
			- Does the company allow for employee flexibility (e.g., working from home, flexible working hours)?
			- What policies are in place that support employees sharing their identity in the workplace?
		- **Processes**
			- What is the company’s onboarding process?
			- How do employees measure the impact of their work?
		- **Values**
			- What are the company’s mission and value statements?
			- How might the person in this role contribute to the organization’s mission?
			- How does the organization support professional development and career growth?
		- **Listen to people’s stories**
			- Listening to what current employees have to say and how they portray the company will give you great insight.
				- What were employees' experiences with similar projects in the past?
				- What can they tell you about key stakeholders and customers?
		- **Take note of company rituals**
			- Rituals can be powerful drivers of culture. They engage people and help instill a sense of shared purpose and experience.
				- How are birthdays and holidays celebrated?
				- Do employees generally eat lunch at the same time and in the same place?
				- Watch employee interactions**: **Observing how employees interact can help you tailor your interaction style to the company norm.
				- Are employee interactions more formal or informal in nature?
				- Are ideas solicited from employees in different roles?
		- **Understand your impact**
			- As a project manager, you become a **change agent**. Remember: a change agent is a person from inside an organization who helps the organization transform by focusing on improving organizational effectiveness and development. When you begin a new role, sit down with management to better understand what is expected of you and how you can make the most of the opportunity.
		- **Sharpen your communication skills**
			- Interpersonal communication skills are a major part of project management. How a company communicates is directly tied to its organizational culture. You will most likely have interactions with various departments and management levels while executing projects. To communicate effectively, you will need to understand how to navigate the different channels in your company. Ask questions about communication practices when you start a new role such as: Is it customary to sign emails from the team rather than from you individually? Should presentations include team members or be solely presented by the project manager? This can help you make sure you are adhering to expectations.
			- Approaching projects differently from how similar projects were managed in the past may be met with some resistance. Although some projects may call for you to break the status quo, when you show an appreciation of your organization’s culture, you may help your team members accept any improvements you are implementing.
	- Understanding Change Management
		- **Integrating project management and change management**
			- As a project manager, you can think of change management as necessary for the successful outcome of your project. Both change management and project management aim to increase the likelihood of project success and incorporate tools and processes to accomplish that goal. The most effective way to achieve a project goal is to integrate project management and change management, and it is your responsibility as a project manager to do so. Let’s look at a few ways you can approach change management on your projects:"
				- **Be proactive: **Incorporate change management into your project management steps. For example, you can schedule documentation reviews periodically to ensure that your team members know there is a place to voice their suggestions and concerns. You can also plan steps towards the end of your project to introduce the deliverable to users in the form of demonstrations, question and answer forums, or marketing videos. You can factor all of these decisions into your plan so that any potential changes are less likely to impact your timeline. If these steps have not been built into your plan, you can escalate and stress the importance of a change management plan to your stakeholders. Proactive and inclusive change management planning can help keep any potentially impacted stakeholders aware of the upcoming changes.
				- **Communicate:**Maintaining communication about upcoming changes are vital to ensuring successful change management. Communication should occur regularly among impacted stakeholders, the change management team, and the project team.
				- **Follow a consistent process:** Following a clear change management process helps maintain consistency each time there is a change. The change management process should be established and documented early on in your project to guide how the project will handle change. Your organization may also have an overarching change management plan that can be adopted for your project. This may include when the promotion of the change should happen, when training should occur, when the launch or release will occur, and corresponding steps for each phase of the process. "
				- **Use tools: **Incorporating tools to assist in the adoption of a change can be very helpful. Let's examine a few examples you can use on your next project. **Feedback mechanisms**, such as surveys, can capture input from stakeholders. [**Flowcharts** ](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/what-is-a-flowchart-tutorial)can visualize the project's development process. [**Culture mapping **](https://medium.com/the-xplane-collection/what-is-culture-mapping-and-why-should-you-care-912f99c4de98)can illustrate the company's culture and how the company's values, norms, and employees behavior may be affected by the change.
			- As the project manager, you are responsible for successfully delivering projects. As you hone the skill set you acquire throughout this program, you will find that change management is essential to your projects’ success.
	- Corporate and project governance
		- **Governance** in business is the management framework within which decisions are made and accountability and responsibility are determined. In simple terms, governance is understanding who is in charge. In this reading, we will discuss corporate governance and project governance. It is important to learn how corporate and project governance are related since you may have to speak about governance in an interview. Additionally, you will need to understand how your project relates to the governance structure of the organization.
		- **Corporate governance**
			- Each organization is governed by its own set of standards and practices that direct and control its actions. Those standards and practices are called **corporate governance**, and they will influence your projects. Corporate governance is the framework by which an organization achieves its goals and objectives. Corporate governance is also a way to balance the requirements of the various corporate entities, such as stakeholders, management, and customers. Corporate governance affects every part of an organization, including action plans, internal and external controls, and performance measurements.
			- Governance and change management go hand-in-hand. Think back to the previous videos on change management. To successfully implement change management, it is essential that you understand the structure and culture of the organization. Effective governance in change management provides clearly defined roles and responsibilities during change. This enables the people within the organization to have a precise understanding of who makes decisions and of the relationship between those managing and participating in the change management process.
			- Another example of governance within an organization is the creation and use of **steering committees**. Steering committees decide on the priorities of an organization and manage the general course of its operations. The steering committee essentially acts as an advisory board or council to help the project manager and the company make and approve strategic decisions that affect both the company and the project.
		- **Project governance**
			- As a project manager, you will be responsible for** project governance**. Project governance is the framework for how project decisions are made. Project governance helps keep projects running smoothly, on time, and within budget. Project governance involves all the key elements that make a project successful. It tells you what activities an organization does and who is responsible for those activities. Project governance covers policies, regulations, functions, processes, procedures, and responsibilities.
		- **How project and corporate governance intersect**
			- Project governance needs to be tailored to your organization's specific needs. These needs will influence how you implement and monitor the governance framework on your project. Project governance concerns those areas of corporate governance that are specifically related to project activities. Effective project governance ensures that an organization’s projects are aligned to the organization’s larger objectives, are delivered efficiently, and are sustainable. This includes:[["Considering the long- and short-term interests of your organization"] ["Making thoughtful decisions about which projects to take on and avoiding projects if you do not have sufficient resources"] ["Providing timely, relevant, and reliable information to the board of directors and other major stakeholders "]]
				- Eliciting the input and buy-in of senior managers since they are the decision-makers
				- During the initiation phase, prioritizing clear, reachable, and sustainable goals in order to reduce confusion and conflict
				- During the planning phase, assigning ownership and accountability to an experienced team to deliver, monitor, and control the process
				- During the execution phase, learning from mistakes and adapting to new or improved knowledge
			- Corporate governance can involve clearing many hurdles before making decisions. These decisions can influence not only a single project, but the entire corporation.
			- At the same time, corporate governance can help support project governance, as it provides oversight on compliance and mitigating risk and offers guidance and direction for project managers. Good corporate governance can also help project managers secure resources, get issues addressed, avoid delays in decision-making, get buy-in from stakeholders, and achieve visibility for projects on the executive level.
		- **Key takeaway**
			- You should think about an organization’s culture and structure when you are interviewing for a new role and as you begin a new role or project. You should consider an organization’s governance processes and practices in the same way. This will help you understand how decisions are made, who is responsible for what, and what are the potential issues and areas of concern.
