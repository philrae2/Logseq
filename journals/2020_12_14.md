	 - **OBMOD delay and approaching concrete deadline**
		 - **Current Need: **To get a more concrete deadline.
			 - Fully understand the needs of OBMOD and the Orange Book Staff for them to feel comfortable on launch

			 - What are the needs of the capabilities and implementation team
				 - What kind of support do we need

				 - How can we minimize our work

		 - ^^Is this a coordination issue and if it is where does it lie?^^
			 - The OBMOD team has been able to meet their deadlines for the first inbound materialized view.

			 - They have lengthy timeline for their deliverable and we recommend including them more in our internal meeting for OBMOD team and Integrity to communicate
				 - Their is hesitancy on their side to directly discuss issues

			 - **__I'm more concerned on internal coordination__**
				 - Internally there has been delays in delivering components
					 - OBMOD component took 1.5 months

					 - There are delays in the parser currently
						 - We are extending 

		 - **Next Steps:**

- [[Meeting]] for [[Orange Book Project]] [[Implementation Appian Projects]]
	 - ((498b8eff-c8fb-4d59-b81b-13f233d82160))
		 - Discuss what needs to happen for Thursday on Integrity side:
			 - Make sure OBMOD team can consume data

			 - The materialized view is up to their specifications

- [[Feedback Journal]] for [[Orange Book Project]]
	 - Feedback:
		 - Kristi said there is a concern for better coordination
			 - We can ask for clarification what needs to happen for better coordination
				 - I think there is coordination between OBMOD since they have delivered on time. Their asks or requests and timelines may not be what we used to. 
					 - There were assumptions on our end

					 - They also changed requirements on us last minute

	 - Outcome:
		 - Not as serious as I thought, no conflicts stemming from Kristi

		 - I still need to prepare and clearly outline the next steps
