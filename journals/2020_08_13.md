	- Father God, help me to be kind today. Forgive me for getting angry at Shreya for handing me over a task that was last minute and something I wasn't part of. The move itself wasn't smart, but it wasn't mean or malicious. Help me Lord to be more forgiving, to be more empathetic.
	  
	  Father God I pray that point these moments of anger. Lord please give me a kinder heart. One that forgives quicker. One that is more loving. In your name I pray. Amen.
