- The higher you set your [[goals]], the more you will [[learn]] from your failures and successes achieving them. 

- When [[negotiating]] or presenting solutions that are less than ideal, [[label]] the fears that come from the solution's effects to interrupt the fear effect quickly. Then present your solution's positives to replace their fears with safety and trust.
	 - #Quote [[label]] your counterpartâ€™s fears to diffuse their power. 
We all want to talk about the happy stuff, but remember, the faster you 
interrupt action in your counterpartâ€™s amygdala, the part of the brain that  generates fear, the faster you can generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust

exciting and contribute to and bless the lives of others

	 - [[Quote]] Near the core of what makes a person a leader is their sense of identity. The  way you see yourself is determinative for your life and for the  decisions you make as a leader. Your sense of [[identity]] directs you in every situation. It is foundational,  determining the level of confidence you have when you challenge your boss in a  disagreement. It establishes your sense of security when you face doubts. Itâ€™s what enables you to process your emotions during tense conversations. Though  much of your identity is formed at an early age, your identity is always evolving. So itâ€™s never too early or too late to begin processing your sense of  self.
