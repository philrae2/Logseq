- [[Seth Godin]]
	- A [[principle]] is an approach you stick with even if you know it might lead to a short-term outcome you don’t prefer. Especially then.
	- It’s this gap between the short-term and the long-term that makes a [[principle]] valuable. If your guiding principle is to do whatever benefits you right now, you don’t have principles of much value.
	- But it’s the valuable [[principle]]s that pay off, because they enable forward motion, particularly when it feels like there are few alternatives. We embrace a culture based on principles because it’s that structure and momentum that enables connection and progress to happen in the first place.
