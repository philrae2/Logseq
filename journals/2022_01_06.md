	 - [[SMT]] [[Orange Book Project]]
		 - Good Morning Everyone, The Orange Book Project is pretty quiet for the month of January with key people on leave. We will pick back up for our February O&M release to work on some backlog items 

		 - We had our usual meetings with Capability teams and IPT, nothing to highlight there.

		 - We had our initial phase 2 scope meeting with OB Division on December 9 and a backlog grooming session on the 14th.

		 - For future activities:
			 - We plan to follow up on these sessions (scoping and backlog grooming) this month once Adi returns from leave.

			 - Iâ€™m also working with Allison, Sophia, and Shanthi as some of the proposed phase 2 scope requires investigation on feasibility and LOE on connecting to another data source. We have an internal FTE meeting Jan 20th with Orange Book Division to discuss that proposal.
