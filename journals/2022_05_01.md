- A problem isn't only viewed with one perspective. It is comprised of many perspectives and viewpoints and each one with a different interpretation and need of the problem. So in fact, one problem maybe multiple problems needing solutions if we take into account the many perspectives. If we are to deliver a solution that is accepted, we need to frame the problem and target the solution to a specific perspective. We can't frame the problem with our own perspective as the solution will mostly likely not align to the users. #[[Problem Solving]] #[[product owner]]
	- Requirements gathering and how it's elicited is important to framing. A simple conversation tell me what you want is going to be disastrous as opposed to a more doctor patient relationship approach to conversation and requirements elicitation.
