	 - [[Orange Book Project]]
		 - Good afternoon everyone thank you for your time today. The purpose of this meeting is to share the enhanced parser outcomes and numbers on project creation between Nexus and DARRTS. And go over the expected behavior and exception events. This data is helpful for Tim to see as they approach to returning into the Nexus production environment.

		 - The second half we'll go over prioritizing the September O&M items as there were additional requests that came up (re-dating deficiency letters and secondary reviews). If anyone else needs to drop at that point, please feel free.

		 - So to start these numbers are about a 3 week span between July 29 to August 18.

		 - Ask Sarma if he wants to make any clarifying remarks.

		 - Cleaned up the production environment. Moving forward the Orange Book Team has to manually close the submissions before restarting in September.

		 - Questions on partially parsed files?

		 - Questions from Tim?
			 - Appending for those forms that kicked out. 

			 - Create a weekly report between DARRTS and Nexus.

			 - Outreach to Industry for guidelines

		 - Questions from PMO?

		 - OK to drop.
