- [[Vaccines]] #[[ðŸ“¥inbox]] [[Article]]
	 - The COVID-19 pandemic likely plunged you into a world â€” specifically, the world of vaccine development â€” that you didn't know much about before. Maybe you've learned that vaccines typically take years to produce. Or maybe you've found yourself wondering how the roughly 200 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development are supposed to work.

	 - Essentially, a vaccine needs to trick your immune system into thinking there's an infection. That way, you'll develop an arsenal of tactics to kill off the pathogen, should it ever show up in your body.

	 - __Live vaccines__ release a somewhat nonfunctional version of the virus into the body. If researchers tamper with it just right, the modified virus can still provoke your immune system without getting you sick. One way to sap a virus of some of its power is to grow it in another species, the way researchers used chick embryo cells to create the measles vaccine. Developers can also neutralize the virus by exposing it to heat or chemicals like formaldehyde, creating what's known as an inactivated vaccine.

	 - There are also vaccines that make your own cells produce the crucial proteins that help fight a virus. Two of these are called __DNA vaccines__ and __RNA vaccines__. DNA varieties can push the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein gene into your cells. Once it's there, the DNA is treated like your own genetic information. Your bodies make RNA â€” temporary copies of the gene â€” and from that template build the viral proteins. RNA vaccines, on the other hand, cut out a few steps in the production process: These vaccines provide the RNA pattern as is, and cells assemble proteins from there.
		 - For an RNA or DNA vaccine to successfully work, it's crucial that the genetic material gets inside your cells to the protein-generating machinery that will properly proliferate the viral protein. Sometimes, vaccine developers make sure this happens by tucking the DNA or RNA into the genome of another virus, using that pathogen as a kind of shipping container. These are called __viral vector vaccines__. Don't worry, you don't get sick from the delivery â€” researchers disable the virus to prevent that from happening.

		 - It's also possible to create a vaccine that does not force cells to make viral proteins, but instead delivers the proteins directly. Some companies are working on these kinds of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, a category generally called __protein-based vaccines__.

	 - On the whole, vaccine developers spend a lot of time at the drawing board. The complexity of the immune system makes it a tough beast to wrangle. When it comes to SARS-CoV-2, any of these vaccine types could emerge from the pack â€” and ultimately help keep COVID-19 at bay.

- [[Article: NEW TECH TAKES ON RECYCLING AT THE MICRO SCALE]] #[[recycling]] 
	 - Takeaways: #[[problem solving]]
		 - We can solve a problem by miniaturizing the process. Through miniaturizing the recycling process we can create efficiencies in the system. 
			 - Miniaturization saves energy through local recycling instead transporting wastes.

		 - Reforming is also another form of recycling. Can we reframe the question or problem and still get to the same goal?

	 - NOT ALL WASTE HAS TO GO TO WASTE. Most of the world's 2.22 billion tons of annual trash ends up in landfills or open dumps. Veena Sahajwalla, a materials scientist and engineer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, has created a solution to our massive trash problem: waste microfactories. These little trash processors â€” some as small as 500 square feet â€” house a series of machines that recycle waste and transform it into new materials with thermal technology. The new all-in-one approach could leave our current recycling processes in the dust.

	 - Sahajwalla launched the world's first waste microfactory targeting electronic waste, or e-waste, in 2018 in Sydney. A second one began recycling plastics in 2019. Now, her lab group is working with university and industry partners to commercialize their patented Microfactorie technology. She says the small scale of the machines will make it easier for them to one day operate on renewable energy, unlike most large manufacturing plants. __The approach will also allow cities to recycle waste into new products on location, avoiding the long, often international, high-emission treks between recycling processors and manufacturing plants.__ With a micro-factory, gone are the days of needing separate facilities to collect and store materials, extract elements and produce new products.

	 - Traditionally, recycling plants break down materials for reuse in similar products â€” like melting down plastic to make more plastic things. Her invention evolves this idea by taking materials from an old product and creating something different. "The kids don't look like the parents," she says.

	 - For example, the microfactories can break down old smartphones and computer monitors and extract silica (from the glass) and carbon (from the plastic casing), and then combine them into silicon carbide nanowires. This generates a common ceramic material with many industrial uses. Sahajwalla refers to this process as "the fourth R," adding "re-form" to the common phrase "reduce, reuse, recycle."

	 - In 2019, just 17.4 percent of e-waste was recycled, so the ability to re-form offers a crucial new development in the challenge recycling complex electronic devices. "[We] can do so much more with materials," says Sahajwalla. "Traditional recycling has not worked for every recycling challenge." She and her team are already working to install the next waste microfactory in the Australian town of Cootamundra by early 2021, with the goal of expanding around the country over the next few years.

	 - Veena Sahajwalla launched a new way to recycle electronic waste that skips tons of transit and re-forms materials on-site. She's since added plastics to the mix, and is expanding her microfactories across Australia.

- [[Article: How Apple Is Organized for Innovation]]
	 - Apple runs their company through a functional organization rather than a multi-divisional structure. Convention states that as businesses grow large and complex, they must shift from a functional to a multidivisional structure to align accountability and control and prevent congestion that occurs when countless decisions flow up from the org chart to the very top. 

	 - Apple relies on a structure that centers on functional expertise to create and drive its innovation. Apple believes that those with the most expertise and experience in a domain should have the decision rights for that domain. 
		 - Apple plays in a highly volatile and ever-changing technological competitive marketâ€”disruptions are high. The company must make bets and take risks about which technology and designs are likely to succeed before they can rely on market feedback and solid market forecasts. Relying on technical experts rather than general managers increases the odds that those bets will pay off.

	 - In [[functional organization]]s, individual and team reputation acts as a control mechanism in placing bets. Its easier to get the balance right between attention to costs and the value added to the user experience when the leaders making decisions are those with deep expertise in their areas rather than general managers being held accountable for meeting numerical targets.

	 - Three [[leadership]] characteristics
		 - __Deep expertise__ Apple is a place where experts lead experts. The assumption is that it's easier to train an expert to manage than to train a manager to be an expert. 

		 - __Immersion in the details__ Leaders should know the details of their organization three levels down. It is essential for speedy and effective cross-functional decision-making at the highest levels. If they do not know the details, then they are either making decisions without the details or postponing the decision. At Apple managers tell war stories about making presentations to senior leaders who drill down into cells on a spreadsheet, lines of code, or a test result on a product. #[[detail oriented]] #leadership
			 - example of detailed-orrientedness: Usually, a rounded corner is created with a rectangle and a circle, however, this creates an abrupt curvature, where straight meets curve. At Apple, they started with a circle to come up with a squircle, they insisted on a continuous curve, the slope starts earlier but less abruptly.

		 - __Willingness to collaboratively debate__ 
			 - A leader's capacity to be both [[open-minded]] and partisan relies on their deep understanding and devotion of the company's values and common culture and also balancing execution of correct solutions with the level of effort. 
				 - Just because a solution is easy, doesn't mean it should be implemented and the challenging actions should be ignored.

	 - As apple expanded it's headcount, leaders had to delegate, learn to become experts at other fields, and know when and what to focus their attention to as they assumed more responsibilities beyond what they can realistically know in great detail. Leaders have to lead other experts.
