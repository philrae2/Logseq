- 18:02 [[Sri]] Meeting Prep #[[Meeting Prep for 3/25/2022]]
	- What is the executive message in the form of a question?
		- Call to action: We need to improve our decision making. Fixing our missteps after the fact is too costly. 
		  id:: ba0f7814-d455-4cf3-a5ac-53294a7d5a76
		- Observed Issues:
			- Does the Office Executive Leadership have the tools to make informed decisions? #question
				- Since this is not a claim but rather a question should we provide evidence or keep asking questions? #comment
				- Issues: #claims We can reframe the points below as questions.
					- No transparency on the quality of data and information from from the bottom up
					- No transparency on the equality of the decision making earlier up in the chain
						- Contractors often frame the problem
							- No transparency on choices made on the framing of the discussion
							- Powerpoint doesn't allow you to evaluate if the right choices have been made or quality of decision making
								- Often filled with claims but no evidence to support the claim
								- We often aren't making the distinction on what is a claim and what is evidence
					- Lack of tools to evaluate quality of information or decision making
						- ((9074717b-4092-43a2-a6b7-c7c992682490))
						- ((b22b9165-6165-4bc0-a848-b1958620d23f))
					- Only way to evaluate information of decision-making or data are the outcomes, but by then then it's already too late.
				- Use the current data  and architecture harmonization as an example to flesh out the story
				- Use the methodology of collecting issues, turning into themes, and then creating a problem statement to help solve the issues.
					- Issues phase
						- No way of collecting issues
						- To turn into themes
	- Steps for resolution
		- Make the decision-making more transparent
			- Call out claims and ask for evidence
			- Ask for metrics for evaluation of the proposals
			- Ask for tools to assess if a given option is good or not
