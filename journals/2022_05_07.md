- #prayer Father God thank you for the many blessings you have given me. I am having a hard time disengaging from work. Lord help me to be kind and generous. To give freely to others, not to only those who I think deserve it but to whom you call everyone your child. Lord help me to do your work. Mold me and make me the person you want me to be. Cleanse me from my selfishness. Help me to love generously. In your name I pray. Amen.
