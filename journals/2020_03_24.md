- Matthew 20
	 - Verse 13: But he, making rejoinder, said to one of them, 'Friend, I am not being unjust to you; did you not agree to a denarius with me? Take what is yours and go; but I wish to give to the last man what I also give you; Am I not permitted to do what I wish with my own possessions? Or is your eye baleful because I am generous?' Thus the last will be first and the first last."

	 - Verse 25 "You know that the rulers of the gentile peoples dominate them, and that their great men wield power over them. It is not so among you; rather, whoever among you wishes to be great will be your servant, And whoever among you wishes to be first will be your slave; Just as the Son of Man came not to be serve and to give his soul as the price of liberation for many."

	 - They say to him, "Lord, that our eyes might be opened." And, moved inwardly with compassion for them, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they saw again and followed him.
