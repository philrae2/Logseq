- [[Book: Waiting on God]]
	 - The True Place of the Creature

	 - These wait all upon Thee; That Thou mayest give them their meat in due season. That Thou givest unto them, they gather; Thou openest Thine hand, they are satisfied with good.
Psalms 104: 27,28

	 - God worked to [[create]] us, and is lovingly working to [[maintain]] us.

	 - God did not create us to let us fend for ourselves, but we are to [[wait]] and [[depend]] on God.

	 - Through us God can show the universe of his love, care, and other incomprehensible adjectives that characterizes God. 

	 - God delights in [[caring]], [[giving]] and [[providing]] for us, we only have to wait upon God. 

	 - As [[nature]] exhibits its dependency on God, we are to notice God's care and realize that is is our nature to be wholly [[dependent]] on God.
