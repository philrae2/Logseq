- Reading and Writing Prompts
  input:: #video
  author:: [[Andy Matuschak]]
	- Observations
		- When Andy is reading a source material he asks himself how the material is being presented. For example how the text is being defined through either contrasting or similar framing of an adjacent topic (i.e., quantum physics vs classical physics)
		- While reading he will also create tasks for himself to prompt him to complete tasks in the future for improved retention. An example is assigning himself to define force in a different way of the usual f = ma.
		- Andy is creating flashcard questions while reading the text. And he will review the flashcards as he reads periodically.
		- When there are concepts that are unclear, Andy will use chatGPT to help get the answer.
		- When reading have a goal so you can decide how much effort and time to invest reading a book.
