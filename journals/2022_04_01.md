	- Thanks
		- Thank you Sri for highlighting and spotlighting good work by OBI staff and asking for it to be shared to the rest of OBI like Monica's Human Factors Implementation Report
			- Lessons Learned are good but how do we go a step further and examine and increasing the utility of the lesson learned?
				- Experimentation of its implementation to solve an existing problem.
					- For example writing detailed memos and documents instead of meetings. Staff can read, comment, and ask questions on the document. A discussion can occur asynchronously in the document instead of the meeting.
		- Lessons Learned on the CDER Nexus Health Check Meeting
	- What does the meeting attendee find valuable?
		- Ask this question?
		- What would make the meeting beneficial to the meeting attendee?
	- State what you can offer
		- Finding the gaps in workflow and trying to align to leadership priorities
			- Lessons Learned and implementing tangible mitigation strategies. Experiments to see if they are actually mitigation strategies
		- What I need help? Determining if the gaps should be addressed and how they should be prioritized
		- Decision making and critical/creative thinking to make a clean work space rather than a reactive stance
	- Issues
		- No Lessons Learned from Projects/Business Complaints
			- Lessons learned and solutions for mitigation
				- Middle management has to raise the bar and expectations on front line employees and empower them to uncover issues and solve the problems
					- Middle Managers have the perspective to see successful and effective processes as well as projects facing challenges and hurdles
						- These need to be highlighted and analyzed to prevent other projects from sharing the same fate or if a positive/effective process or outcome share with other implementation teams to ensure successful outcomes
							- Examples: GDIT project approach and design, generally assessed positively (KASA, LRT)
								- REMS project failure stoppage, OM WER using contractor funds for PME like activities
								- IND refactor
							- Expectations that processes should be developed and shared out to the rest of the organization to prevent and mitigate from happening again
								- We can employ the mutual learning approach
					- Prototype
						- How to carve out funding and scheduling
					- PME
						- No clue on Nexus
						- Process to be improved
						- No clear directions
					- Controlled Correspondences
						- Requirements
						- Booz
			- No spotlighting of good work that could be shared throughout the organization to improve processes
				- Difference of quality of work between contractors
			- Ask about OGD talks
			- Lessons Learned from OGD complaint
		- Examples:
