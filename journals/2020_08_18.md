		 - Thank you lord for a quite day at work. Thank you for your presence and your guidance at work. Lord thank you for the continued leadership and help dealing with all my project. Let me not take your glory but glorify you instead. Thank you for helping me pursue success for others at work and not of my own.

		 - Father God, I continue to ask for your wisdom and help in dealing with my projects and their eventual success. Father God, I am here because of you and not of my own. I pray for your daily help, for knowledge, humility, and humbleness.
