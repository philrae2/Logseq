	- Responsibilities of PM within a team
		- First, you'll need to hold all team members accountable for their assigned tasks. Managing tasks will help you hold your team members accountable by giving them ownership over specific pieces of the project.
		- Second, you'll need to ensure that issues and risks are tracked and visible, and be able to establish escalation paths. Now by escalation paths, I mean that you should know how you will communicate risks to the right people at the right time. #[[Lessons Learned]]
		- Third, you'll need to understand and help teammates adopt the right workflows and project management styles. As the project manager, you'll likely have the best idea of which style is best for the work. It's your job to ensure that the team adheres to that style and the other systems in place.
		- And fourth, you'll need to collaborate with other teams at the organization to meet the requirements based on project, scope, schedule, and budget.

	- **Clarify goals**
		- When working with cross-functional teams, it is important to ensure that each member of the team understands their role, how they support each other, and the common goals of the project. It is vital to set clear goals for the team and make sure that the team understands those goals. Be direct and concise, avoiding extraneous details and explanations. When communicating task or project goals, make sure you define key items, such as budget, deadlines, quality requirements, or important resources. Ensure your team members understand task and project goals by encouraging them to ask questions and clarify information. It will be up to you to continuously check in with your team to make sure they’re all moving towards their goals, staying on track, and completing quality work. Cross-functional teams may work in different departments, be in different physical locations, and have different leadership, but all team members work together with the project manager to support the current project. Your project may be competing against other priorities, so communicating clearly and often with your team—and vice versa—helps you identify any potential issues or concerns before they arise. #[[Lessons Learned]] __How can we answer the unanswered questions. Overcommunicate.__
	- **Get team members with the right skills**
		- Making sure you have team members with the correct skillsets for each of the project functions is critical. If you are building an airplane and you’ve got five engineers but no mechanics, you are missing a key element of your cross-functional team. As the project manager, you must help ensure that your team has the right people with the right skill sets needed for the project to succeed.
	- **Measure progress**
		- Showing your team how much they have accomplished helps keep them [[motivate]]d. Take the time to measure and communicate the project’s progress across the cross-functional team. This helps everyone see the full picture and recognize their impact on the project. You can measure progress in many ways, including meeting key milestones, completing project tasks, and meeting project goals on time and within budget. Regularly communicate with your team members to check on their progress. Ask them if they anticipate being finished on time. If not, ask how you can help them succeed. Keep track of the team’s progress throughout the project by documenting when tasks and goals are completed, and let your team members know if the project is on track or not. Make sure you communicate successes, delays, or issues, to the team so they know how the project is progressing. Keeping everyone informed is essential to the project’s success.
	- **Recognize efforts**
		- Sometimes, when you work with cross-functional teams, there are certain skills that get recognized more than others. A mechanic could get accolades for coming up with the solution to a problem within the project, while the finance member who sourced the funding might be forgotten. As a project manager, it is your job to make sure that each member of your cross-functional team recognizes the value of their efforts each step of the way. You have learned the importance of building relationships with stakeholders, and building relationships with your cross-functional team members is just as important. Learning what makes your team members feel supported, giving and taking feedback, and being mindful of each individual's background, personal identifiers, and work style can help mediate some of the differences among team members.
	- > The most important thing for you to keep in mind is staying organized. The more organized you are in your actions, the more organized your team is in their thinking and their actions. #[[Lessons Learned]]
	- **The core skills of a project manager**
		- Enable decision-making on the team, or gathering decisions from the appropriate leader, is crucial to keep projects on task and achieve their goals. Ensure that projects stay on schedule by gathering information from teammates and using those insights to help the team make informed decisions.
			- Ensure that those decisions are communicated to the necessary coworkers, whether that's the immediate team or company leaders.
		- The second skill is communicating and escalating. This might look like documenting plans, sending emails about the status of the project, or holding a meeting to escalate risks or issues to stakeholders.
		- **Flexible planning**
			- Change is inevitable, and the more flexible you are as a project manager, the more successful you will be throughout your career. These flexible planning strategies can help you manage your project during times of unpredictability:
				- **Assess external constraints**. When planning your project, take external events into account, such as national holidays and team member vacations, and sick leave. Leaving extra time in the schedule for these inevitable events upfront can help minimize the impact to your project.
				- **Plan for risks and challenges**. If you consider the risks that may occur, you may be able to find solutions for them in advance. For example, what if someone on your team gets sick or decides to quit? Are you able to replace them within the company? If not, can you hire an independent contractor? Come up with a list of people who may be able to join your team if one of your team members becomes unavailable. You can also assess risks by looking at historical data. Review your past projects and examine the challenges you faced. Then evaluate if similar challenges could occur in this project and prepare accordingly.
				- **Consider alternative scenarios**. Review all of your project’s tasks and the relationships among them. Find tasks that could “**float**,” meaning that a change in their delivery would not affect the project's overall success or impact its timeline. This can help you determine where you can change the order of tasks or juggle resources if needed.
		- **Strong organizational skills**
			- If you demonstrate that it is important for you, as a leader, to stay organized through efficient tracking and communications, your team will follow suit. One way to do this is by utilizing the abundance of organizational tools available, such as:
				- Planning and scheduling software (templates, workflows, calendars)
				- Collaboration tools (email, collaboration software, dashboards)
				- Documentation (files, plans, spreadsheets)
				- Quality assurance tools (evaluations, productivity trackers, reports)
			- You may need to try different organizational approaches and explore several methods to determine what works best for you and your team.
			- Finally, a successful project manager needs strong organizational skills. Having strong organizational skills means having the ability to organize the processes and the core elements of a project to ensure nothing gets lost or overlooked, which can and does happen. To prevent this, you might decide to track daily tasks in a spreadsheet or send frequent status updates or reminders.
		- **Handling ambiguity**
			- Ambiguity can be a big challenge in managing projects. Project managers often face ambiguity in goals, requirements, schedules, vision, or other areas related to the project. Your team will look to you to lead during times of ambiguity and change, and flexibility is especially important during these instances. Here are some different ways to help your team deal with ambiguity:
				- **Keep calm. ** In uncertain times, handling ambiguity with grace and poise will help inspire the members of your team to do the same.
				- **Express empathy** As a project manager, it is important to try to understand what your team is thinking and feeling, especially during times of ambiguity. Let your team members know that you care about the challenges they are facing and are there to support them.
				- **Trust the expertise of your team**. Increase clarity by having everyone on your team discuss what they already know or believe to be true based on their areas of expertise. Then, discuss what you still don’t know and brainstorm ways to gather more information.
				- **Make decisions and stick to them**. Try not to second-guess your decisions in front of your team since this can lead to greater uncertainty. If you need to change course, clearly communicate and explain your choice to do so with your team.
				- **Assess, document, and communicate any assumptions you make when planning a project.** Assumptions are necessary in projects, but they can also pose a risk.
				- **Communicate what you know clearly**. Define the aspects of the project that are confirmed and will not change.

			- Notes: Eunice was able to get a seat with Elizabeth, so no need for a Steering Committee seat
			- FY 21 Projects - OM WER + OMUFA workflow
			- FY 22 - Still pending - OM WER + User Fee Reporting
				- We should get updates in the summer. Hopefully PMO is more communicative of the review process. If they reach out to us first, well let you know.
				- OFM DUFBMF reports
					- Submissions with Unsatisfied Parent Companies
					- DMF Ready for Review Report
					- Transfer Tracker
					- DMF Running Payment Tracker
			- GDUFA III, PDUFA, BSUFA
				- Regulatory mandated workflows so any changes and impacts are highly prioritized.
				- Let us know if you foresee impacts and we can collaborate on a solution to address those changes.
			- **Ask questions!**
			- OND Nexus Transition was discussed in our previous meeting in January and the concern from that discussion was how to best advocate for OM Brands needs in the design and development of the NDA review workflows. How to best get a seat in the table when these solutions are discussed so we can provide suggestions and recommendations that take into account the Brands Branch perspective in these OND Processes to make sure the the information OM needs to complete their reviews are being collected and the RPMs are taught those behaviors.
				- The PMO should have reached out to OM Leadership to discuss and open a channel of communications to help address those concerns. In addition to being part of these OND discussions, I know talking to Eunice one need was to representation on the Steering Committees.
				- I know Panorama and DARRTS haven't been all that seamless and there are still existing pain points, I think it would be motivation to make sure that the OND processes are designed with OM's needs in mind.
			- The OGD, OPQ and OM Generics are much further away. So nothing to report now, but I think how Brands team handles and collaborates with OND to create a more cohesively design workflow could serve as a model.

	- __Understanding Needs__
		- When you are working with a subject matter expert, an engineer, a product designer, a UX person, the same things apply. You have to be able to talk to any engineer on your team, any product manager you need to work with, and you have to understand their unique needs. Program Management isn't just about the process and the artifacts that you create, it's about how you relate to people. Understanding what you've learned in other parts of your life, whether it was in a bar or art school, these are the experiences that you bring into the job that make your work unique. Your skills, talking to people or de-escalating conflict or understanding what people need. This is what makes you a great program manager.
	- __Common myths about project managers__
		- **Myth: **You have to be an expert in the field and have a lot of technical knowledge about the project.
			- **Reality: **There are benefits to the project manager not having a lot of technical knowledge about a project. Rather than getting caught up in the technical details when communicating with management and stakeholders, the project manager can look at all of the different pieces that the cross-functional team is working on and assess how they each contribute to the success of the project. As a project manager, you bring on the right team members—with their differing areas of expertise—and trust them to be able to focus on the technical aspects of the project. Your job is to handle the communication, documentation, and organization necessary to get the project successfully to the finish line.
		- **Myth**: Only people with a lot of experience within an organization can manage projects there successfully.
			- **Reality: **It is a common misconception that anyone who has significant experience and success in an organization can manage projects there. In order to successfully manage projects in any organization, you must acquire the necessary skills, knowledge, tools, and techniques and be able to apply them. You don’t necessarily need to have worked in previous roles at that organization. In taking this certification, you are learning and practicing how to be an effective project manager before taking on a position.
		- **Myth:** You have to know every single detail about the project at all times.
			- **Reality:** Details matter in project execution, but as a project manager, you must also focus on the big picture and strategy for the project. What is the end goal? Do you and your team have a clear direction? If the whole team understands their objectives and has what they need to be successful in their tasks, they can work on the individual details and provide you space to supervise the overall project goals. Open lines of communication will help ensure that your team members share any possible risks to the budget or schedule with you.
			- **The bottom line**: Your role as a project manager is to communicate with your stakeholders, clarify objectives, and set expectations. Trust your team to handle the details of each project task and communicate with you when there’s an issue. Through your direct communication and strategic approach to problem-solving, you can provide solutions and help remove barriers for your team. This is where you add value!
