		 - Father God thank you for the weekend. Forgive me for still struggling to give you the time that you need and not keeping everything that I do within your presence. I am swallowed up by this world and this job. Please help me to make you my number one priority in life.

Teach me how to live the life you want me to live. Help me to trust you in all things and give over all my anxieties to you.

		 - Lord I pray that you are with me at work today. Please take my anxieties about the Orange Book project and having these discussions with the OBMOD team. Father God I need your help with this project to be successful.

I have been spending so much time, including the Sabbath to be better at this and haven't prayed to you for help. Lord I ask now for your guidance, mercy, and intervention that everyone on the team and the stakeholders communicate properly. Help me to accept your plans. I pray to be humble and willing for you to take the lead. Amen.
