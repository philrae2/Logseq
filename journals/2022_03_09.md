		 - A separate backlog document (apart from JIRA tickets)
			 - Product owner therefore doesn’t have much input on prioritization without this documentation

			 - Dev team drives the prioritization not PO with JIRA only tickets

		 - Sprint Plan is provided (PowerPoint slide)
			 - Owned and prioritized by developers – no prioritization from POs

		 - A Sprint sign-off documentation (similar to LRT)
			 - Little feedback from PO before sprint, only after already developing

			 - Without sign-off documentation we lack another opportunity explore alternative paths, exception cases
				 - Exception cases can arise too late after release 1 or cause a time crunch if before release

		 - Agreed upon Sprint 0 deliverables
			 - Seeing no set deliverable documents from implementation team to implementation team at least for Sprint 0
