		 - [[fleeting note]] are notes you take on the fly
			 - they can be put in the [[ðŸ“¥inbox]]
				 - The inbox can contain fleeting notes that need to be processed. It can be thoughts you've written down, a link or content you found on the internet, or highlights from your reading. 

			 - fleeting notes are casual and maybe disorganized. 

			 - Highlights of an e-book may qualify as fleeting notes

			 - The purpose of a fleeting note is to say "here's something interesting that I may want to remember or refer to some day." 

		 - [[Literature Note]]: condensed notes of an entire article, book, etc. 
			 - They are informal summaries about the content you consumed whether a book or an article. 

			 - They often are in the of bullet-point list and can be broken up by topics

			 - We usually write literate notes from referencing our fleeting notes

			 - Literature notes are good reminders for quick review and also serves as a good writing exercise to help you better understand the material.
				 - To write literature notes you have to think about what you learned and write your thoughts on how to explain it to yourself or to others. This helps you remember the material better.

		 - [[permanent note]]s: are summarization of a single idea. These are assigned keywords and linked to other notes.
			 - Permanent notes should only contain one idea per note. But it can be supported by multiple literature notes that all provide evidence for it. 

			 - Permanent notes are written based on literature notes as your source. A permanent note is the important distillation from a collection of literature notes that we can connect with other notes. 

			 - We know we are writing permanent notes if we can take a collection of permanent notes and use them to be able to create a draft of a book or an article.

			 - The ultimate goal of your zettelkasten is to create permanent notes before you synthesize something new. 

		 - We can also borrow from [[GTD]] the concepts of inbox, someday/maybe, and raw
			 - Inbox 
				 - Is where we put fleeting notes that need processing

			 - Someday/maybe 
				 - are for content that may not reach high priority that they need processing now. Or may not be relevant to the projects and problems you're currently working at

			 - Raw
				 - Is for storing the raw exported highlights from books or articles

	 - Copying notes and rewriting our notes [[Q: Should I always rewrite my notes?]]
		 - The process of multiple rewriting sessions for each phase of the fleeting note, to produce a literature note, then in turn rewriting literature notes to permanent notes seem inefficient and wasteful. 
			 - We are tempted to skip this phase and take the short cut of cutting, copying and pasting. 

			 - "Great ideas are not constructed in a linear and step-by-step process that would be more "efficient" if only those steps were done faster. 

			 - Resist the urge to copy and pasteâ€”take the extra effort of rewriting the note you want to remember.

			 - There is information not worth rewriting, ask yourself if you need to learn it or retrieve it in the future.

			 - [[q: How to comment in note taking?]]
				 - (You can comment to a note using a parenthes)

	 - [[Q: What to rewrite when note writing?]]
		 - Only try to write down the important things. You want to try to reserve your mental energy thinking original thoughts not rethinking about other people's writings. 

		 - You can highlight to your hearts content but reserve re-writing to only important and valuable information that you would want to remember for the future.
