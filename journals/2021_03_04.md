	 - Reflect on how my emotions impacted my work (attitude, interactions with others, communication) at the end of the day.

	 - Today I didn't have many opportunities to conduct my three daily check-ins. I was spending my time reading on decision making and thinking. I feel like I could be working on something more but feel sluggish and leaning on procrastination.

	 - Tomorrow seems like a light day. I should work my COR training and other side projects. I find it difficult not having the authority to make thing happens. I need to find creative ways to problem solve the improvements that could happen.

	 - Eric Kandel researched the mechanisms of memory in sea slugs, which earned him a Nobel Prize in 2000.

	 - One of his research led him to identify the fear gene in mice. There are two types of [[fear]] behavior, learned fear and instinctive fear. If the stathmin gene is knocked, a relatively fearless mouse is produced. Normally a mouse when placed in a field, will travel along the edges of the field, fearful of the center. But a gene knockout mouse will spend more time in the center. It is no longer afraid. 
		 - The gene not only affects instinctual fear, but also learned fear. 

		 - This research can lead to new approach to treatment of anti-anxiety cases. 

	 - Happiness and fear are part of the same system, however they may not be the same genes that influence these systems.

	 - There are two medically proven methods of [[psychotherapy]]
		 - 1. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] developed by Arron Beck at the University of Pennsylvania
			 - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on modifying dysfunctional emotions, behaviors, and thoughts by interrogating and uprooting negative or irrational beliefs. Considered a "solutions-oriented" form of talk therapy, CBT rests on the idea that thoughts and perceptions influence behavior.

			 - Feeling distressed, in some cases, may distort one‚Äôs perception of reality. CBT aims to identify harmful thoughts, assess whether they are an accurate depiction of reality, and, if they are not, employ strategies to challenge and overcome them.

			 - CBT is appropriate for people of all ages, including children, adolescents, and adults. Evidence has mounted that CBT can address numerous conditions, such as major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and many others.

			 - CBT is a preferred modality of therapy among practitioners and insurance companies alike as it can be effective in a brief period of time, generally 5 to 20 sessions, though there is no set time frame. Research indicates that CBT can be delivered effectively online, in addition to face-to-face therapy sessions.

		 - 2. Interpersonal therapy developed by Myrna Weissman at Columbia
			 - __Interpersonal Psychotherapy__ https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/interpersonal-psychotherapy
				 - Interpersonal¬†[psychotherapy](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy)¬†(IPT) is a time-limited, focused, evidence-based approach to treat mood disorders. The main goal of IPT is to improve the quality of a client‚Äôs interpersonal relationships and social functioning to help reduce their distress. IPT provides strategies to resolve problems within four key areas.

				 - First, it addresses interpersonal deficits, including¬†[social isolation](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/loneliness)¬†or involvement in unfulfilling relationships. Second, it can help patients manage unresolved¬†[grief](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/grief)‚Äîif the onset of distress is linked to the death of a loved one, either recent or past. Third, IPT can help with difficult life transitions like¬†[retirement](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/aging),¬†[divorce](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/divorce), or moving to another city. Fourth, IPT is recommended for dealing with interpersonal disputes that emerge from conflicting expectations between partners, family members, close friends, or coworkers.

			 - __When It's Used__
				 - IPT was originally developed to treat major depressive disorder. It‚Äôs also used effectively to treat eating disorders, perinatal¬†[depression](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression), drug and¬†[alcohol](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/alcohol)¬†[addiction](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction), dysthymia, and other mood disorders‚Äîincluding¬†[bipolar disorder](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bipolar-disorder). IPT differs from other traditional psychodynamic approaches in that it examines current rather than past relationships, and recognizes‚Äîbut does not focus on‚Äîinternal conflicts.

				 - The practice differs from cognitive and behavioral therapy approaches because it addresses maladaptive thoughts and behaviors only as they apply to interpersonal relationships. IPT aims to change relationship patterns rather than the associated depressive symptoms, as well as target relationship difficulties that exacerbate these symptoms. IPT is less directive than¬†[cognitive-behavioral](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/cognitive-behavioral-therapy)¬†approaches‚Äîfocusing on the patient‚Äôs specified target areas without dwelling on his or her¬†[personality](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/personality)¬†traits.
