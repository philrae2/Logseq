	 - Definition of a leader: We don't have to conform to what society defines as a leader. Usually, leadership is viewed as authority, control, and power.  
		 - We can become great leaders by defining for ourselves what leadership means and something that we can live with.

				 - For an organization, the beginning of the end comes when the brains realize the upper layers are colonized by incompetents and get into "why bother mode" 

	 - A good leader has a [[mission]] and a frame of view that serves as a filter on how they assess their actions and behaviors.
		 - We can see actions as either right or wrong depending on the [[framework]] we adopt as leaders. We can have a mission for efficiency and effectiveness or a mission for customer-focused service. Depending on what viewpoint we take an action can be judged as wrong or right.
