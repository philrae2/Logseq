- [[Weekly Review]]
	 - Thank you Lord for bringing me through another week at work. Thank you for your guidance and help with the Orange Book project. Please help me to let go of Liam's abruptness and Integrity's lack of transparency on the search for the solution for the method of use code generation. Lord I pray for guidance, kindness, and grace. 

I thank you for keeping me sane and kind. It is a struggle to be humble. Lord thank you very much for lending me your patience in that situation. Lord I pray that you keep intervening and I pray that I trust you more in my day to day.

In your name I pray. Amen.
