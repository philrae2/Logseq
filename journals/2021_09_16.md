		 - Good Morning Everyone, The Orange Book Project is on track for our September O&M Release .

		 - We had preliminary discussions with Sophia and Shanthi to address further enhancing project creation as well as options to address DARRTS and Nexus interconnectivity. Once we have Adi come back we'll restart those conversations to explore those options, then when ready rope in Tim our product owner to confirm and validate our thinking

		 - We've been meeting with Tim to provide transparency to build confidence on returning to the Nexus environment through discussion of the parsing logic enhancements and its outcomes

		 - We're also continuing our discussions on further  O&M enhancements

		 - For planned activities we completed our second ORR for OB this morning where we got a confirmation for return of the OB staff into the Nexus environment 10/4, barring any significant jumps in missing projects or false positives

		 - And we're looking forward to our 9/17 September O&M release
