- [[Review]] your [[automatic]] [[habit]]s if they are still [[valuable]] and [[helpful]] to you
	 - be aware of your [[habit]]s and make them [[intentional]] rather than [[automatic]]

- [[Redesign]] your [[identity]]. Quote: "Facebook redesigns. Twitter redesigns. [[Personalities]], careers, and teams also need redesigns. There are no [[permanent]] [[solutions]] in a dynamic system.

	 - [[happiness]] is not about [[positive]] [[thoughts]]. It's not about negative thoughts. It's about the absence of [[desire]], especially the base of desire for [[external]] things. The fewer desires I can have, the more I can accept the current state of things, the less my mind is moving, because the mind really exists in motion toward the future or the past. 

	 - Happiness to me is mainly not suffering, not [[desiring]], not thinking too much about the future or past, really embracing the present moment and the reality of what is, and the way it is.

	 - One can be very happy as long as one isn't too caught up in their own head.
