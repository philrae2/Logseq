	 - Creating a variable
		 - Variables declared using var are created before any code is executed in a process known as hoisting. Their initial value is undefined.
			 - Var is not a global socpe

		 - Variables declared using let will change
			 - Let declares global variables

			 - var is function scoped and let is block scoped.

		 - Variable declared using const cannot be changed you will get a type error
			 - Const is also a global variable

		 - Global variables are declared outside a function, while local variables outside the function

		 - **Classes are much smaller than global structure so the impact of an instance variable is much smaller**. By keeping small class sizes and adhering closely to the single responsibility principle, much of the downside of a global variable is averted.

		 - Use typof variableName to check type of the variable

	 - Conditionals
id:: aa24bf73-5ebc-4fcf-a928-bd4f0a413a15
		 - == and === 
			 - === is strict, both the value and the type of variable must be the same

		 - Falsy values
			 - So which values are __falsy__— or evaluate to false when checked as a condition? The list of falsy values includes:
				 - 0

				 - Empty strings like "" or ''

				 - null which represent when there is no value at all

				 - undefined which represent when a declared variable lacks a value

				 - NaN, or Not a Number

		 - Ternary Operator
			 - In the spirit of using short-hand syntax, we can use a __ternary operator__ to simplify an if...else statement.

			 - Take a look at the if...else statement example:

			 - We can use a __ternary operator__ to perform the same functionality:

			 - Ternary operations should be kept short. https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/can-ternary-operators-contain-multiple-actions/428487
