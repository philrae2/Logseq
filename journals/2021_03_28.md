		 - Leadership often makes quick and fast decisions and in order to do so rely on executive summaries of information to make informed decisions. These summaries of information often come from people lower in position who are versed and have specific and intimate knowledge of a certain domain.

		 - Often leadership does not build feedback loops asking for detailed information before making a decision or building and implementing a process? (Is this assumption true?â€”for now, I think this is true at OBI, I don't see a visible feedback loop on the decision-making process)

		 - We need to create processes that creatively analyze and critique information for our leaders. We then need to simplify and present this digested information back for informed decision-making for leadership.
