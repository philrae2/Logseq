- [[Morning Prayer]]
	 - Lord thank you for waking me up this morning to spend time with you. Lord I pray for your guidance and continued leading of my life. Please be with my thoughts today. Help me to be positive and trusting, gracious and kind. Please take away these negative thoughts and replace my heart with yours. In your name I pray. Amen.
