- #metrics  Why measure performance when the key foundational business processes have issues? Performance metrics and measuring employee performance transfers the consequences of bad leadership decision between leadership and employees. Bad decisions by leaders aren't visible until the frontline employees try to execute and perform tasks that are directly influenced by them. Usually the front line employee's output is much more visible and measurable than leadership decisions.
  
  Leadership decisions should be treated as a project, complete with stakeholders, product owners, and most importantly a product vision. The outcomes of leadership decisions often serve as the foundations or are pillars to projects. However, the outcomes of leadership decisions are not measured for quality.
