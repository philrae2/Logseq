	 - Agenda topics
		 - Orange Book debrief - challenges and lessons learned for this project

		 - Prototyping or PME’s activities to improve requirements and development process

	 - Project Ideas
		 - Create a POC document so employees can find who to contact - separate from the Division Workstreams excel document

		 - A document of high-level executive happenings and discussions happening at the senior leadership level - with corresponding explanations on how and when to execute at the frontline level.

		 - Example here would be the data model and architecture review discussions. Should we keep this in mind now, what does these talks mean in the near future?

		 - The document can also house comments or other topics you’ve heard that we need further clarification and definition from senior leadership.
