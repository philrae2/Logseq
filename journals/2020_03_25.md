- Prayer
	 - Father God thank you for your guidance during the work day. Lord help me to be content with what you have given me. This apartment and my job. Help me to be thankful and grateful for the blessings you have given me all my life, but especially my move into Maryland with my new job. I have a cheap apartment and a great landlord. 

	 - Thank you for all the things you have done for me and your continued protection. Thank you for being present in my life. I pray that you bring me closer to getting to know your character. Amen.
