		 - Executive Summary

		 - Brief background
			 - Workflow

			 - Stakeholders

			 - Affected Systems

			 - Users
				 - Product Owner - technically versed, included in the capability testing

			 - Not fully understanding the solution

		 - Issues
			 - Testing

			 - Communication with leadership if you disagree with a decision

			 - Communication with Capabilities Team
				 - Requirements and edge cases were not communicated clearly to the Capability Team

				 - I didn't ensure what the Capability Team was building met the requirements and addressed edge cases

				 - Untested assumptions - scanned  PDFS/flat PDFs created errors in the developed solution
					 - Work closely with capability team to gain better understanding of the solution. Don't assume Capability teams know what you're asking for.

			 - Lack of exploring the unhappy path

			 - Transition from active to development to O&M too quickly and abrupt

		 - Types of Lessons Learned
			 - Communication
				 - Process to discuss "leadership" decisions if you disagree
					 - Use Smarter Leaders Smarter Teams

					 - Example: At the time there was a push to deprecate  DARRTS and Orange Book Nexus solution was strongly recommended to not create DARRTS integration
						 - Ensure that recommendations given you make sense to the best of your ability
							 - Ask for the decision making process

							 - Evidence and documentation of the decision making approach.

							 - Ask the documentation of planning for executing  

						 - If it's a new approach make sure your development takes an extra level of care to mitigate possible problems (enhanced  communication, testing, risk management)

			 - Development
				 - Testing
					 - Enhance level of testing for new tecnologies

					 - Work with the product owner to account for unhappy paths to test and edge case scenarios
