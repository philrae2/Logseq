- [[Morning Prayer]]
	 - Father God thank you for your continued presence as I struggle to get being a "Christian" correct and keeping the "Sabbath." I stray further and further away from my more conservative roots and mentally give excuses.

I don't know anymore how to "be" a Christian and how do it properly. Lord please guide me and lead me how to have a better relationship with you. Amen.
