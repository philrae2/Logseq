- [[OM WER]]
	 - [[Scope Discussion]]
		 - Good Afternoon everyone, Thank You Sophia for your dialogue with the OM Policy Team regarding their involvement with the WER workflow in Nexus.

		 - This slide is to help us make sure we are on the same page of the defining the boundaries of the Release 1 workflow.

		 - In previous meetings we discussed the core workflows of OM Brands but haven't really delved into the details much on OM Policy involvement other than in emails.

		 - So on this slide specifically the second bullet point, we're taking this opportunity to get agreement on the must haves and correct our assumptions. 

		 - So previously our proposal was for Policy team Involvement  to be defined by bullets 1 and 2
			 - From the reading of the email response it seems this is a smaller boundary than what is asked? 

			 - Are there any other important big ticket items that we aren't highlighting or considering about the OM workflow.
				 - In terms of consulting can OM use the same consult solution as the Brands Branch

				 - Are we okay with defining the boundaries here? 

			 - The Appeals workflow it seemed like this was okay to push as a second release?

		 - The third bullet point about timelines is affected by the scope? One big question here is the target date expectations for release 1? 
			 - **Timeline is May or June. per Jeen**

		 - Target dates are high level estimates
