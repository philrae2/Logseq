				 - Orange Book is public facing

- [[Daily Review]]
	 - UAT testing inadvertently running in parallel with another team testing in the Orange Book application, creating errors on our users test. This is creating some perception problems. 
		 - Communication and planning should be improved to make sure only one team is in the environment during tests.

	 - I missed an important meeting about the OM WER process where the PMO team is deferring the OM WER project. 
		 - #[[Lessons Learned]]Create a daily review and preview template to review the current day and preview the next day
			 - I'm having reservations on how to handle the missed meeting. Address the issue quickly or not. (I emailed Christine, owing up to the problem, laid out a solution for prevention and things turned out ok.)

- [[Daily Preview]]
	 - 16:28 Tomorrow I only have two meetings starting at 9:30am but have many project up in the air. I have questions on how to take lead on the OBI SharePoint website and getting help on getting more meetings for new hires.

	 - I am unsure on what to projects to work on. COR training is one and possibly Orange Book related projects. And prepare for PIV internal projects
