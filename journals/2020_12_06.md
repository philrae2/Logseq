	 - Lord thank you for your blessings at work this week. Thank you for your guidance and leadership even though I did not voice intentionally for your help. Subconsciously I know Lord to ask for your blessings, but I get too busy to ask. Thank you for delivering your saving grace to people like me. Forgive me for not being grateful enough.

	 - Father God as I look forward to the upcoming week, I pray that I spend more time with you at work and in my daily life. Help me to trust you and get to know you better. Please help me in that journey, in your name I pray.

- [[Article: Founders and Researchers]]  by [[Sam Altman]]
	 - [Researchers and Founders](https://blog.samaltman.com/researchers-and-founders)
		 - I spent many years working with founders and now I work with researchers.

		 - Although there are always individual exceptions, on average it’s surprising to me how different the best people in these groups are (including in some qualities that I had assumed were present in great people everywhere, like very high levels of self-belief).

		 - So I’ve been thinking about the ways they’re the same, because maybe there is something to learn about qualities of really effective people in general.

		 - ^^The best people in both groups spend a lot of time reflecting on some version of the Hamming question—"what are the most important problems in your field, and why aren’t you working on them?”^^ In general, no one reflects on this question enough, but the best people do it the most, and have the best ‘problem taste’, which is some combination of learning to think independently, reason about the future, and identify attack vectors. (This from John Schulman is worth reading: http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html).

		 - ^^They have a laser focus on the next step in front of them combined with long-term vision. Most people only have one or the other.^^

		 - They are extremely persistent and willing to work hard. As far as I can tell, there is no high-probability way to be very successful without this, and you should be suspicious of people who tell you otherwise unless you’d be happy having their career (and be especially suspicious if they worked hard themselves).

		 - They have a bias towards action and trying things, and they’re clear-eyed and honest about what is working and what isn’t (importantly, this goes both ways—I’m amazed by how many people will see something working and then not pursue it).

		 - They are creative idea-generators—a lot of the ideas may be terrible, but there is never a shortage.

		 - They really value autonomy and have a hard time with rules that they don’t think make sense. They are definitely not lemmings.

		 - Their motivations are often more complex than they seem—specifically, they are frequently very driven by genuine curiosity.

- 4. See your blind spots #[[Books: Thanks for the Feedback]]

	 - There is a gap between the self we think we present and the way others see us. A blind spot is something we don’t see about ourselves that others do see
		 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FReligion%2Fx4CN187Vpy.png?alt=media&token=9992287e-c727-4d99-8332-447d2d429a4c)

		 - We are not aware of how our intentions (our thoughts and feelings) are leaking out to others that are not aligned with our actions or tone of speaking.

		 - There are three dynamics that amplify the gap between how we see ourselves and how others see us.
			 - 1. Emotional health: It can seem that emotions are part of the environment rather than part of us. But situations are not tense. People are tense. 

			 - 2. situation versus character: We can interpret events from the situation or the character. If I'm late to the meeting, I may have the data that I was juggling multiple items at once and you may blame and label my character as uncaring.

			 - 3. Impact versus intent: We judge ourselves based on our intention (which is invisible to others) and others judge us through our impact (actions/behavior)
				 - Even good intentions can lead to negative impacts

			 - The fix is to separate out the impacts from our intentions. 

			 - When we feel bullied by others, those "bullies" may not be aware of the impact of their behaviors and actions

	 - What helps us see our  blind spots?
		 - **use your reaction as a blind-spot alert.** When you notice yourself wondering "what was their agenda?" and "What's wrong with them?", make sure your next thought is "I wonder if this feedback is sitting in my blind-spot?"

		 - **Ask: How do I get in my own way**?
			 - Ask for specific feedback. 

		 - **Get a second opinion**

		 - **Record yourself**

		 - **Focus on change from the inside out**

		 - **Have a purpose**

- 5. Don't switch track: Disentangle what from who #[[Books: Thanks for the Feedback]]
id:: ec2c494f-cbfc-48f8-b17f-71060ca352d5
	 - switch track is when conversation partners derail from the topic and start giving feedback on topics that no one is receiving. 

	 - switch track has two potential impacts:
		 - the second topic may be more important than the feedback that triggers it

		 - Since we now have to topics the conversation can get tangled, often we don't know there are now two topics
			 - sometimes the second topic is not out in the open

	 - Switch tracking occurs in four steps:
		 - We get feedback

		 - we experience a relationship trigger
			 - 1. What we think about them (3 domains)
				 - Skill or judgement: How, when, or where they gave the feedback

				 - credibility
					 - We can benefit from the insight of newcomers or outsiders unencumbered by knowledge of "the way things are done." They might ask the right "naïve" question, or offer a unique perspective.  

					 - New ideas often come from those without traditional credibility, who are freer to think outside the box precisely because they don't know there is a box. #innovation

					 - their values and identity may not match ours but shared experience and environments should be taken into account before dismissing their feedback

				 - trust
					 - We may trust or mistrust the person's motivations in giving us feedback. Intentions are invisible, leading to the earning of trust. However we have to learn to separate trust and the content of their feedback. Don't use the trigger of trust to automatically disqualify feedback

		 - we change the topic to how we feel

		 - we talk past each other

	 - We may get the most honest feedback from the people we have the hardest time dealing with. 
		 - To fast track our growth, go directly to the people who we have the hardest time with. Ask them what we're doing the that's exacerbating the situation.
