	 - Types of Intelligence [Fluid Intelligence vs. Crystallized Intelligence (verywellmind.com)](https://www.verywellmind.com/fluid-intelligence-vs-crystallized-intelligence-2795004#:~:text=Fluid%20Intelligence.%20Cattell%20defined%20fluid%20intelligence%20as%20%22the,to%20think%20and%20reason%20abstractly%20and%20solve%20problems.)
		 - [[Fluid intelligence]] refers to the ability to reason and think flexibly. Fluid intelligence involves being able to think and reason abstractly and solve problems. This ability is considered independent of learning, experience, and education.

		 - [[Crystallized intelligence]] refers to the accumulation of knowledge, facts, and skills that are acquired throughout life. Crystallized intelligence is based upon facts and rooted in experiences. As we age and accumulate new knowledge and understanding, crystallized intelligence becomes stronger.

		 - The ability to quickly and nimbly integrate new information into your current set of beliefs.

		 - The willingness to change your existing beliefs according to the strength of evidence that supports them.

		 - If you want to be intelligent improve your fluid intelligence and increase your open mindedness

	 - [[decision making]]
		 - [[base rate]]
			 - Start with the outside view rather than starting from the inside view first. Outside view is the consideration of what statistics has to say including base rates. 

	 - [[improvement]]
		 - If we want to be better at something we need to start keeping score and measuring our outcomes. When we don't measure outcomes, then there is no highlighting for areas of improvement or placing responsibility and accountability.
			 - Barriers to accountability and keeping score is that we may find out how wrong we are. Thus people don't want to put in processes for measurement. 

			 - Status hierarchy problem. If we start keeping score then we have open transparency on how all individuals, including people at the top, are performing

		 - Don't be afraid of looking stupid if you can make a seemingly impossible problem move away from impossible to possibly solvable. Break down complex or very difficult problems into smaller components to find a small easier to solve the problem.  
			 - > When people make forecasts inside most organizations today, accuracy is only one of the
goals that they’re pursuing. They’re also interested in making forecasts that are going to be difficult to falsify so they can’t be embarrassed. A lot of the forecasting inside organizations doesn’t involve numbers. It involves a lot of vague verbiage. They’re also interested in making forecasts that don’t annoy other people in the organization. They don’t want to tip the political
apple cart over.

They’re compromising accuracy in a whole host of ways that help promote their careers inside the organization, help to maintain political stability in the organization, but they aren’t all that centrally focused on accuracy.

		 - Solutions are not made for all problems. A solution may work for one situation due to lack of bureaucracy or lack of social or behavior constraints, but may not work for an organization that doesn't want to promote elitism. Example only hiring or making groups of your smartest employees.

		 - Don't try to come up with predictions or solutions to questions that are incredibly random or unpredictable.

		 - Solve the problem of how to become more open minded. #[[Professional Development]]

		 - Have a skeptical mind and reflect on both your success (by considering the involvement of luck) and your failures.
