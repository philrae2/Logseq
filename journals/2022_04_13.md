		- [[TBM 12/52 - The Basics]]
			- **In my mind The Basics include:**
				- A charter and mission
				- A strategy
				- One or more models
				- A roadmap filled with bets
				- Artifacts for those bets
				- Bet-related metrics, Input metrics, goals
				- Great kickoffs and great learning reviews
				- An approach to continuous improvement
			- Charter and Mission
				- Have a team charter, and a team mission. Whose life are you planning to make easier? Why? What do you care about? What are your operating principles as a team? What are your current working agreements? I am a firm believer that teams should have stable focus areas that span multiple years (except for in the smallest startups).
			- Strategy
				- Have one. ReadÂ [Rumelt](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239). If the strategy tries to be all things to all people, keep refining it. Ideally, if you do the things below youâ€™ll have a better sense of what is working, and that will help.
			- **One or More Models**
				- It helps to have a couples that act as the connective tissue between your strategy and your roadmap. See theÂ [Appropriate Models section in this post](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-852-the-data-informed-product?utm_source=url&s=w). SeeÂ [this post](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-452-an-actionable-post-with-examples?s=w)Â for prompts that can help you evolve your own models.
			- Roadmap
				- Have an always up-to-date one year roadmap filled with suitably detailed bets. Detail things at the last responsible moment, and not before.
				- This is a yearâ€™s worth of work. It really isnâ€™t that much.

				- A year may seem like a long time (especially for the Agile folks). But when done correctlyâ€”without solutions, focused on opportunitiesâ€”it can work fine. Working with aÂ [continuous roadmap](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-2152-continuous-roadmapping?s=w)Â is so much better than big-bang planning. And to re-iterate, keep itÂ [suitably detailed](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-41b52-suitably-detailed-roadmap?s=w).
			- **Bet Metrics**
				- Every bet should have a set of bet-specific metrics. Bet-specific metrics help us understand usage. In general these metrics are more contained. They are more about the internal workings of the bet. And less about impact on Inputs (see below). How do you know you have bet metrics? Simple. They are unique to the bet.
				- __Example: Error rates, time to complete a workflow, the usage of certain interface elements, usage by certain cohorts, etc.__
			- **Target Input(s)**
				- Every bet should target one (or more)Â __persistent__Â input metrics. In the cast of Inputs that are more lagging, you may need persistent sub-Inputs. Persistent input metrics do not change very often. They stay stable for many quarters/years. How do you know if you have a target Input? Simple. Over time, multiple bets will target the same input(s).
				- __Example: Tweaks to the onboarding flow will increase the % of users who successfully complete one or more high value actions within the first two weeks of usage.__
				- [Hereâ€™s a free webinar on Inputs](https://info.amplitude.com/north-star-inputs-flywheels). If you use the right models (see One or More Models, above),Â [youâ€™ll figure out these inputs before you figure out your bets](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-652-inputs-first-bets-next?s=w).
			- **Goals**
				- It is up to the team whether to set bet-specific goals, or to set quarterly goals that may span multiple bets. Either will do. OKRs may be a good option, orâ€”if the team has bet-specific goalsâ€”may be overkill. Goals are helpful, until you start making it unsafe to have them. So keep goal-setting safe.
				- [Hereâ€™s a free webinar on OKRs](https://info.amplitude.com/growth-series-north-star-202108).
			- **Kickoff and Learning Review**
				- Every bet has two hugely important rituals/events. The first is the kickoff. A well facilitated kickoff plays a huge role in the success of any initiative. The second is a learning review. The learning review shares an analysis of impact, and key lessons. If you get kickoffs and learning reviews dialed in, youâ€™re further ahead than most teams. For longer efforts, consider more frequent learning reviews.
			- Retrospectives and Continuous Improvement
				- Some kind of mechanism to reflect on how things are going, review past improvement experiments, and prioritize small improvement experiments. I like POPCORN.

	- Focused Vs Diffused Modes of Learning
		- Researchers have found that we have two fundamentally different modes of thinking. Here, I'll call them the Focused and the Diffuse modes.
			- Focused mode of learning is when you are working on a familiar problem or very similar type of problem you've encountered in the past.
			- Diffused mode is when you are tackling new concepts and new information you're processing.
