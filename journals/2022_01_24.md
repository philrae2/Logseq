The agenda for today is to consider the technical feasibility of connecting to the Orange Book data tables. So we have here in the meeting representation from the Orange Book Division, WFM Nexus Team, and Integrity team.

		 - Questions:
			 - Exclusivity workflow - what is the backend for this? Existing OBMOD connection or direct connection to the data tables

			 - EBDR

			 - What are the considerations before connecting to the OB data tables?
				 - Can the capability team take this work on?

				 - Who would own the logic and error-checking? What level?

				 - Who are the capability stakeholders? OIMT - side?

				 - EBDR - within firewall, will migrate

				 - FEDRAMP - medium

				 - No Integrity in between
					 - How will Integrity get the data if needed?
