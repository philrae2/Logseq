			 - Don't learning something if you don't understand it
				 - You'll end up polluting your learning process and not be interested in the learning activity due to the frustration of lack of comprehension

			 - Learn first before memorizing
				 - First build a solid overall picture of your learned knowledge. We can drastically reduce our learning time when individual pieces fit a single coherent structure

			 - Formulate your material as simply and as minimally possible
				 - Simplicity does not have to imply losing information and skipping the difficult part. Simple is easy.
