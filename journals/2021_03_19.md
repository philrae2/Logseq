		 - Parsing triggered through US Regional for the file name and submission type
			 - Will they not parse if the file is not a 3542 form

		 - Training request - user friendly guide 

		 - Training two weeks prior to guideline, April 6

		 - TODO Post launch - post MVP drop down
			 - TODO checkbox for the interim for editing fields

			 - TODO request 3542a be blocked for renaming

	 - [[Orange Book Project]]+ [[Capability Team]]
		 - Parsing for files named patent, level of effort

	 - Data driven decision making is using facts as the foundational decision drivers. This means gathering the  data through surveys and other methods rather than hunches, personal experience, or conjecture

	 - **Data Life Cycle** 
		 - __Planning__ 
			 - What plans and decisions do you need to make? 

			 - What data do you need to answer your question?

			 - What kind of data should you be gathering?

			 - Once you have your data how will you use it?

		 - __Capture__
			 - Where does your data come from?

			 - How will you get it?

		 - __Manage __
			 - How will you store your data?

			 - What should it be used for, and how do you keep this data secure and protected?

		 - __Analyze__
			 - How will the company analyze data? 

			 - What tools should they use?

		 - __Archive__
			 - What should do they with their data when it gets old? 

			 - How do they know when it's time?

		 - __Destroy__
			 - Should they ever dispose of any data? If so, when and how?

			 - __Ask Phase__
				 - We define the problem to be solved and make sure we fully understand stakeholder expectations.
					 - Defining the problem means looking at the current state and identify how it's different from the ideal state. Usually there's an obstacle we need to get rid of or something wrong that needs to be fixed.

					 - Use the [[The Five Whys]], [[Systems Thinking]], [[First Principles Thinking]]

			 - __Prepare__
				 - Collect and store data. 

			 - __Process Step__
				 - Find and eliminate errors and inaccuracies.

	 - Takeaways
		 - What are the stories about ourselves do we want to tell others
			 - How has the stories we heard from others affecting our own stories and identity

		 - What are the stories we hear about others that we assume are true but are actually false

- [[The Knowledge Project]] [[Pedro Domingos]]
	 - Pedro Domingos is a professor researching machine learning and wrote the book The Master Algorithm.

	 - **Where [[knowledge]] comes from**
		 - We have knowledge encoded in our DNA

		 - Knowledge is also gained through our experience

		 - Knowledge can now come from computers, which is knowledge gleaned from data through computers

	 - Knowledge induced from data is uncertain because we don't necessarily know if we generalized correctly. Although knowledge gained from experience we tend to be overly confident about.
		 - Machine learning has greater advantage over human thinking is that it can consume a vast amount of data.

	 - It's easier for AI to automate white collar jobs than blue collar jobs because white collar jobs like lawyers and doctors are unnatural for humans. They have to go to school to learn them, while AI can master that information, with infinite information, speed, and consistency. AI can better diagnose x-rays and symptoms than doctors.

	 - AI can be beaten by a combination of human and AI, for example the best chess players are human and AI that can beat a computer program.
