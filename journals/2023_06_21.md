	- It's helpful to **visualise your workflows** and identify if there are any gaps in the way that you are processing information.
	- Pre-thinking information flows
		- What are the **different concepts, data and entities** and how do I want to represent them?
		- These can can be defined at either a page level or a block level.
			- When in doubt, defer to using pages.-
		- How will these different entities **relate to each other**?
			- Will I use properties, page links, block references etc?
		- Does the **information change state, or is it transformed in any way?** Does the information have to move anywhere?
			- Create mechanisms to track status and interactions, and preferably document.
		- Is the information used somewhere else? **How do I want to reference it?**
			- Use page reference and block reference features depending on your preferences.
		- How can I **make resurfacing these elements easy**?
			- Develop consistent linking practices (namespaces, MOCs, bottom-up linking, embeds, etc)
		- Do you need to **keep track of information?**
			- Create a changelog in a page (or even on the Daily Journal
