	 - Don't multitask when making decisions. 
		 - People do not multitask effectively. The more people multitask the worse they are, not just at other mental activities, but at multitasking itself. 
			 - We are worse at distinguishing what is helpful and relevant information and ignoring irrelevant and distracting signals and noise (information overload) #[[information overload]]

		 - Multitasking is not thinking, it impairs it. 

		 - [[thinking]] is concentrating on one thing long enough to develop an idea about it. 

		 - We have to be patient and give our brains the time to think through multiple ideas  and to make connections to the information we already have. We can't be distracted by Twitter, Facebook, and our phones in order to think efficiently and effectively. 

	 - We do our best thinking by slowing down and concentrating.

	 - To improve our ability to think we have to spend more time thinking. 
		 - > It's only by concentrating, sticking to the question, being patient, letting all the parts of my mind come into play, that I arrive at an original idea. By giving my brain a chance to make associations, draw connections, take me by surprise. - [[William Deresiewicz]]

- [[Books: Deep Work]]
	 - For a rhythmic deep work schedule, [[Cal Newport]], recommends working for 90-minute sessions with a total of up to four and a half hours. So 3 90-minute sessions throughout the day.

	 - Single tasking is a foundation of deep work and not to waste time with distractions like other tasks.
		 - Single-tasking creates a space for enjoyable, difficult work. 
			 - Hard work broken down into smaller, disjointed time spaces can be dreadful, while hard work that's given the space and time to breathe can be pleasant.

		 - In single-tasking, we can give ourselves permission to do nothing or do the task itself. But we cannot switch to a different task. 

- #[[Lessons Learned]]
	 - [[happiness]] is our responsibility.

	 - Find [[happiness]] at work.

	 - You need interpersonal skills
		 - No matter how talented and brilliant we are—we must have interpersonal skills to succeed. 

	 - Everyone needs [[autonomy]]
		 - Career satisfaction is often dependent on how much autonomy we have on the job. We need the freedom to make decisions and move in directions that interest us, without too much control from the top. 

	 - Life is short, we need to be more aware and selective about how we use our time. We need to stop wasting our time and use it more carefully.
		 - Travel more.

	 - Take a chance. We are more likely to regret something we didn't do rather than something we did do.

		 - Processes and operational excellence are the key drivers to executing consistently for long-term success rather than innovation and growth. 

		 - [[Jeff Wilke]] insisted on creating Amazon's leadership principles and that they also apply to every employee at Amazon.com #[[leadership principles]]

		 - Leadership principles guide our communication with others, to write documents. They also inform on how to give feedback to people, how to set your goals and how you measure against those goals. Principles allow us guided decision-making and are the foundations of designing and building operational processes.

		 - We need to periodically assess and inspect our tools and processes to make sure the process is being used as intended—and if it can be improved. 
			 - We can't blame the people who are doing the process. We have to inspect the process and ask ourselves if this is optimal? Is it working? Is the data still as accurate as we thought it was?

		 - > We measured everything, and we focused on the inputs, not the outputs.
			 - If you focus on the inputs, you're less likely to worry about the output because the inputs, if chosen correctly, will correct the outputs.

		 - How do we create courage in the people who we are working with?
			 - > Don't hide all your peculiarities. You will make more authentic connections with people if you have the courage to reveal yourself.

			 - If people fail we separate the problem from the people.

			 - If people are failing because of things that aren't within their control, we let them know that we're removing those barriers. 

			 - We set up the foundational relationship with people that informs them they are held to high standards and they are supported through failures.
