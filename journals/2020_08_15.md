- A good workflow can easily turn into a good feedback loop where the positive experience can take us to the next task with ease. This feedback loop can help us better at our jobs and in turn makes the the work and the job more enjoyable.

But if we feel stuck at our work, we can become demotivated, leading us to procrastination, and in turn turning our work and our job a bad experience. This can make our work quality degrade and even create failures. #thinkAbout
