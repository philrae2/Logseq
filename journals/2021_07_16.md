		 - tags: #[[ðŸš§ Projects]] #[[Orange Book Staff]] 

		 - status: #ongoing

		 - Options
			 - Option for mandatory CC - not feasible as new strength or new dosage form is not collected at the time to tie in with the approval letter 

			 - Option for reporting - dependent if the systems collect this information

			 - Option 3 - wait for OND processes to go into the Nexus workflow

		 - Questions
			 - Can Palantir have this feasibility?
